VIRGINIA M. HERNANDEZ COVINGTON, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE.

VIRGINIA M. HERNANDEZ COVINGTON 
ORDER
This matter comes before the Court upon consideration of Plaintiff Apple Glen Investors, L.P.'s Renewed Motion to Determine Amount of Prejudgment Interest and for Entry of Final Judgment (Doc. # 100), filed on July 18, 2016. Defendant Express Scripts, Inc. (ESI) filed its response in opposition on August 15, 2016. (Doc. # 103). After careful review, the Court grants the Motion as specified herein.
I. Background 
A detailed recitation of the facts is unnecessary for the proper disposition of the pending Motion. Rather, an overview of the procedural history suffices for present purposes.
Apple Glen filed suit against ESI in state court on May 27, 2014. (Doc. # 2). Then, on June 25, 2014, ESI removed to this Court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. (Doc. # 1). Apple Glen's Complaint brought a single count for breach of contract against ESI. (Doc. # 2). The Court referred the action to mediation; however, mediation resulted in an impasse. (Doc. ## 14, 24). Thereafter, ESI moved for summary judgment, which the Court denied. (Doc. ## 42, 55).
The Court conducted a bench trial, which started September 8, 2015, and concluded September 14, 2015. (Doc. ## 77-81). Apple Glen and ESI each submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the Court on November 16, 2015. (Doc. ## 83, 85). On March 10, 2016, the Court entered its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. (Doc. # 86). Therein, the Court determined that ESI was liable to Apple Glen in the amount of $4,654,688.65. (  Id. at 64). And, as to prejudgment interest, the Court found Apple Glen was "entitled to prejudgment interest from April 1, 2014, through the date on which final judgment is entered." ( Id.). Judgment was entered consistent with the Court's Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on March 11, 2016. (Doc. # 87).
ESI subsequently filed a notice of appeal on April 7, 2016. (Doc. # 88). Shortly thereafter, on April 11, 2016, Apple Glen moved the Court to determine the amount of prejudgment interest and enter an amended, final judgment. (Doc. # 90). Apple Glen also moved for attorney's fees and costs on the same day. (Doc. # 91). The Court denied both motions on April 15, 2016. (Doc. # 92).
The Eleventh Circuit dismissed ESI's appeal for lack of jurisdiction, concluding the Court's March 11, 2016, judgment was not final and appealable. (Doc. # 98 at 2). Furthermore, the Eleventh Circuit remanded the [*2] action so that a determination as to the amount of prejudgment interest could be made. ( Id.). The Eleventh Circuit instructed, "[o]nce a determination has been made, the district court can enter an appealable final judgment." ( Id.).
Apple Glen then filed its pending Motion on July 18, 2016, and ESI filed its response on August 15, 2016. (Doc. ## 100, 103). In their memorandums, the parties contest whether Apple Glen is entitled to prejudgment interest, what the applicable prejudgment interest rate is, and when prejudgment interest stops accruing.
II. Analysis 
Generally speaking, "[t]he computation of prejudgment interest is a 'mathematical computation' and 'a purely ministerial duty.'" SEB S.A. v. Sunbeam Corp., 476 F.3d 1317 , 1320 (11th Cir. 2007). "The ministerial task of calculating prejudgment interest can be accomplished if the judgment amount, the prejudgment interest rate, and the date from which prejudgment interest accrues have been established." U.S. S.E.C. v. Carrillo, 325 F.3d 1268 , 1272 (11th Cir. 2003). "However, if the judgment amount, the prejudgment interest rate, or the date from which prejudgment interest accrues is unclear, the calculation of prejudgment interest is no longer a ministerial act and the court's order is not final." Id . Here, the Court's Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law determined the judgment amount to be $4,654,688.65 and further determined the date from which prejudgment interest accrues to be April 1, 2014. (Doc. # 86 at 64). Thus, if Apple Glen is entitled to prejudgment interest, the sole remaining criterion to make a final order——and the calculation of prejudgment interest ministerial in nature——is a determination of the prejudgment interest rate. The Court now considers the parties' arguments.
1. Entitlement to Prejudgment Interest 
"Whether a successful claimant is entitled to prejudgment interest is a question of state law." Venn v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 99 F.3d 1058 , 1066 (11th Cir. 1996) (citation omitted). "'[S]ince at least before the turn of the century, Florida has adopted the position that prejudgment interest is merely another element of pecuniary damages.'" Bosem v. Musa Holdings, Inc., 46 So.3d 42 , 45 (Fla. 2010) (quoting Argonaut Ins. Co. v. May Plumbing Co., 474 So.2d 212 , 214 (Fla. 1985)).
Furthermore, the Supreme Court of Florida has repeatedly affirmed its adherence to the "loss theory." Id . (citing Fla. Steel Corp. v. Adaptable Devs., Inc., 503 So. 2d 1232 , 1236 (Fla. 1986)). "Under the 'loss theory,' . . . neither the merit of the defense nor the certainty of the amount of loss affects the award of prejudgment interest. Rather, the loss itself is a wrongful deprivation . . . [and] Plaintiff is to be made whole from the date of the loss . . . ." Id . (quoting Argonaut, 474 So. 2d at 214 ). "'Thus, it has long been the law in Florida that in contract actions, and in certain tort cases, once the amount of damages is determined, prejudgment interest is allowed from the date of the loss or the accrual of cause of action.'" Id . (citation omitted).
"This general rule is not absolute," Broward Cty. v. Finlayson, 555 So. 2d 1211 , 1213 (Fla. 1990), however. "'"[I]nterest is not recovered according to a rigid theory of compensation for money withheld, but is given in response to considerations of fairness. It is denied when its exaction would be inequitable."'" [*3] Id . (quoting Flack v. Graham, 461 So. 2d 82 , 84 (Fla. 1984)). And, "[u]pon a consideration of [the following] factors, a district court may decide not to award prejudgment interest or to reduce the amount of interest":
(1) in matters concerning government entities, whether it would be equitable to put the burden of paying interest on the public in choosing between innocent victims; (2) whether it is equitable to allow an award of prejudgment interest when the delay between injury and judgment is the fault of the prevailing party; (3) whether it is equitable to award prejudgment interest to a party who could have, but failed to, mitigate its damages.
Wiand v. Lee, 753 F.3d 1194 , 1204 (11th Cir. 2014) (citing Blasland, Bouck & Lee, Inc. v. City of N. Miami, 283 F.3d 1286 , 1297 (11th Cir. 2002)).

In this case, the first factor is not applicable because no government entity is involved. As to the second factor, the record does not indicate Apple Glen delayed in bringing this action. ESI vacated the Leased Premises on March 31, 2014, and Apple Glen brought the current action on May 27, 2014. (Doc. # 86 at 2). With less than two months having elapsed between the date ESI vacated the Leased Premises and the date on which suit was instituted, the Court cannot say Apple Glen delayed in bringing the action.
And, regarding the third factor, Apple Glen argues it could not have mitigated its damages because it suffered the damages on the day it took possession of the Leased Premises. ESI does not provide an argument in direct response to this point. After review of the record, the Court does not find that the third factor weighs heavily enough for the Court to exercise its discretionary, equitable powers to deny an award of prejudgment interest.
Moreover, the Court finds ESI's arguments against the awarding of prejudgment interest unpersuasive. ESI first argues that Apple Glen should not be awarded prejudgment interest because it has not expended any money to repair or replace much of the equipment found to be in a deficient condition. In other words, ESI argues that prejudgment interest should not be awarded because Apple Glen has yet to incur any out-of-pocket expense for much of the equipment determined to be in a deficient condition. ESI's out-of-pocket argument, however, is undercut by Eleventh Circuit and Supreme Court of Florida precedent. For example, in Venn, 99 F.3d at 1066-67 , the Eleventh Circuit rejected an attempt to carry over the out-of-pocket limitation for tort actions established in Alvarado v. Rice, 614 So. 2d 498 , 500 (Fla. 1993), to actions sounding in contract.
Likewise, the Supreme Court of Florida has rejected an attempt to carry over the out-of-pocket limitation for tort actions to contract actions. In Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co. v. Percefull, an insurance company refused to pay benefits to a claimant, and the claimant sued for breach of contract. 653 So. 2d 389 , 389 (Fla. 1995). The trial court stated in its final order that the claimant would only be entitled to prejudgment interest if it had actually paid the claims out of its own pocket.  Id. at 389-90 . The intermediate appellate court reversed and the Supreme Court of Florida affirmed the appellate court's decision.  Id. at 390 [*4] . In so doing, the Supreme Court of Florida found the insurance company's windfall argument unpersuasive, noting how the claimant used the prejudgment interest money was inconsequential to whether prejudgment interest should be awarded. Id . 
As the Supreme Court of Florida stated in Lumbermens, "[t]he trial court should have granted [claimant's] request for prejudgment interest on the debt created by [claimant's] contract . . . without requiring proof that [claimant] had incurred any out-of-pocket expenses." Id . Thus, on the basis of Venn and Lumbermens, the Court finds ESI's out-of-pocket argument unpersuasive.
ESI further argues prejudgment interest should not be awarded to Apple Glen because the amount of ESI's liability could not have been determined at the outset. But, "[u]nder the 'loss theory,' . . . neither the merit of the defense nor the certainty of the amount of loss affects the award of prejudgment interest. Bosem, 46 So.3d at 45 (emphasis added). Accordingly, ESI's second argument as to why prejudgment interest should not be awarded to Apple Glen is unpersuasive.
Lastly, the Court notes that its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law found Apple Glen "entitled to prejudgment interest from April 1, 2014." (Doc. # 86 at 64). For the reasons above, the Court sees no reason to retreat from that finding. Having rejected both of ESI's arguments, and having determined no equitable reason requires the Court to decline to award prejudgment interest, the Court determines Apple Glen is entitled to prejudgment interest.
2. Prejudgment Interest Rate 
"In all cases where interest shall accrue without a special contract for the rate thereof, the rate is the rate provided for in s. 55.03 ." Fla. Stat. § 687.01 . The statutory rate set by Florida law was 4.75% from April 1, 2014, to March 31, 2016; 4.78% from April 1, 2016, to June 30, 2016; and 4.84% from July 1, 2016, to present. FLORIDA'S CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, Division of Accounting and Auditing, Vendors, Judgment Interest Rates (Sept. 6, 2016, 11:05AM), http://www.myfloridacfo.com/Division/AA/Vendors/default.htm . But where parties contract for a specific interest rate to apply, that contracted interest rate displaces the statutory rate. Republic Servs., Inc. v. Calabrese, 939 So. 2d 225 , 226 (Fla. 5th DCA 2006).
Apple Glen argues that the default interest rate set forth in the Lease should apply, whereas ESI argues the Florida statutory prejudgment interest rate should govern. After review, the Court agrees that the interest rate provided for in the Lease applies.
The Lease defines "Default Rate" as "an annual rate of interest equal to (i) the highest rate of interest which may be lawfully charged on amounts past due with respect to the Loan or (ii), if no Loan is then in effect, fifteen percent (15%) . . . ." (PX-4 at ¶ 1). During the relevant time period, Apple Glen, as borrower, was subject to an 18% interest rate on any amounts past due under its loan from USAmeribank, a non-party to this action. (Doc. # 100-1 at 7, ¶ 5). In addition, the Lease defines "Additional Rent" as "all amounts, costs, expenses, liabilities and obligations which Tenant is required to pay pursuant to the terms of this Lease other than Basic Rent." (PX-4 at ¶ 1). "[*5] Basic Rent" was set as the "minimum annual rent" in "an annual amount equal to . . . $1,749,384.00 . . . ." ( Id. at ¶¶ 1, 4). The Lease also obligated ESI to
at all times, at Tenant's sole cost and expense, put, keep and maintain the Leased Premises . . . and the Equipment in a first class condition and order of repair, except for ordinary wear and tear, and shall promptly make all repairs and replacements of every kind and nature . . . which may be required to be made upon or in connection with the Leased Premises in order to keep and maintain the Leased Premises in the order and condition required . . . .
( Id. at ¶ 12(a)). Moreover, the Lease required ESI to "replace with other operational equipment or parts . . . any of the Equipment . . . which shall have become worn out or unusable for the purpose for which it is intended, or been lost, stolen, damaged or destroyed . . . ." ( Id. at ¶ 12(d)).

Under the terms of the Lease, ESI was required to "put, keep and maintain the Leased Premises . . . and the Equipment in a first class condition and order of repair." ( Id. at ¶ 12(a)). ESI was also obligated to replace equipment that had become worn out, unusable, lost, stolen, damaged, or destroyed. ( Id. at ¶ 12(d)). After a bench trial, the Court concluded that ESI had breached these duties and that Apple Glen suffered damages in the amount of $4,654,688.65. Because the Court's quantification of damages owed to Apple Glen rests on the obligations ESI assumed under the Lease, the amount due is Additional Rent——i.e., an "amount[], cost[], expense[], liabilit[y] and obligation[] which Tenant is required to pay pursuant to the terms of this Lease other than Basic Rent" (PX-4 at ¶ 1)——and the Default Rate of 18% applies.
Notably, this Court's interpretation of the Lease is consistent with that of the court in Apple Glen v. Merck-Medco Managed Care, L.L.C., No. 09-27647-G (Fla. 13th Cir. Ct. Mar. 28, 2014). In Apple Glen, the tenant contracted to replace the roof of the Leased Premises with a one-ply system; however, Apple Glen took the position that a two-ply system was required to maintain the building in a first-class condition. (Doc. # 100-2 at 2). Because tenant would not purchase the two-ply system, Apple Glen paid the difference between the one-ply and two-play systems, and thereafter brought a breach of contract action. ( Id.). The court found Apple Glen entitled to the roof replacement costs, plus interest at the Default Rate, i.e., 18%, as set forth in the Lease. ( Id. at 5).
3. When Prejudgment Interest Ends and Postjudgment Begins 
"'In a diversity case [courts] follow the state law governing the award of [prejudgment] interest.'" SEB, 476 F.3d at 1320 (quoting Royster Co. v. Union Carbide Corp., 737 F.2d 941 , 948 (11th Cir. 1984)) (second alteration in original). Both parties agree that Florida law applies in this case. And, under Florida law, "prejudgment interest accrues until the date of the judgment after which postjudgment interest begins to accrue."  Id. at 1321 . Further, "Florida law does not allow for a gap in the award of prejudgment and postjudgment interest."  Id. at 1320 (citing Bel— Bel Int'l Corp. v. Cmty. Bank of Homestead, 162 F.3d 1101 , 1110-11 (11th Cir. 1998)). While state law governs prejudgment interest in diversity cases, federal law governs postjudgment interest. G.M. Brod & Co., Inc. v. U.S. Home Corp.[*6] , 759 F.2d 1526 , 1542 (11th Cir. 1985) (noting district court correctly applied the federal interest statute in a diversity case). The applicable federal statute provides "[i]nterest shall be allowed on any money judgment in a civil case recovered in a district court. . . . Such interest shall be calculated from the date of the entry of the judgment . . . ." 28 U.S.C. § 1961(a) . Such "postjudgment interest compensates the successful plaintiff for being deprived of compensation for the loss from the time between the 'ascertainment of the damage' and the payment by the defendant." Johansen v. Combustion Eng'g, Inc., 170 F.3d 1320 , 1339 (11th Cir. 1999) (citing Kaiser Aluminum & Chem. Corp. v. Bonjorno, 494 U.S. 827 , 835-36 , 110 S. Ct. 1570 , 108 L. Ed. 2d 842 (1990)).
The parties disagree as to when prejudgment interest should end and postjudgment interest should begin. In particular, Apple Glen argues postjudgment interest should not begin to accrue until the entry of a final, appealable order; thus, Apple Glen argues postjudgment interest should begin to accrue when——i.e., prejudgment interest should not stop accruing until——the Court enters the amended judgment. In contrast, ESI argues postjudgment interest should begin to accrue from the date the judgment that establishes the prevailing party's entitlement to an award was entered; thus, ESI argues postjudgment interest began to accrue when the Court entered its original judgment on March 11, 2016. After review, the Court determines that prejudgment interest ceased accruing on March 11, 2016, (the date the Court entered its original judgment) and postjudgment interest began to accrue on March 12, 2016.
Although Apple Glen correctly cites Dishman v. UNUM Life Insurance Company of America, 269 F.3d 974 , 990-91 (9th Cir. 2001), as holding that the term "judgment" as used in 28 U.S.C. § 1961 means a final, appealable order, the Eleventh Circuit has not adopted Dishman, nor has it addressed the exact issue that the Court faces. But, the Third and Sixth Circuits have taken contrary positions to Dishman. Skretvedt v. E.I. DuPont De Nemours, 372 F.3d 193 , 217 (3d Cir. 2004) ("while postjudgment interest can begin to accrue on a non-final judgment . . ., the phrase 'any money judgment' in § 1961(a) 'requires that the judgment at issue award a fixed amount of fees to the prevailing party in order to trigger the post-judgment interest period'") (citation omitted); Skalka v. Fernald Envtl. Restoration Mgmt. Corp., 178 F.3d 414 , 429 (6th Cir. 1999) ("the better rule is for plaintiffs to be entitled to post-judgment interest from the date of entry of the initial, partial judgment . . ., even though that judgment was not yet appealable. This holding is consistent with the text of § 1961 and the common meaning of the word 'judgment'").
Furthermore, as Apple Glen concedes, the plain language of § 1961 does not define "judgment" as a final, appealable order. Rather the term "judgment" as used in the third sentence of § 1961 refers to the term "money judgment" and "an analysis of the language of § 1961(a) leads to the conclusion that a 'money judgment' is the judgment that unconditionally entitles the prevailing party to," Associated Gen. Contractors of Ohio, Inc. v. Drabik, 250 F.3d 482 , 494 (6th Cir. 2001), the award.
Notably, in a recent case, the Eleventh Circuit cited Drabik with approval [*7] and as being in accord with its decisional authority. See Mock v. Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc., 456 Fed. Appx. 799 , 803 (11th Cir. 2012). In Mock, the district court entered its judgment awarding plaintiff damages and then three years later entered an order awarding a sum certain in attorney's fees.  Id. at 800 . The district court, however, failed to award interest on costs and fees from the date of the judgment awarding damages. Id . The plaintiff appealed and the Eleventh Circuit reversed.  Id. at 803 . In so doing, the Eleventh Circuit reasoned that it was the judgment on the merits, which ascertained liability, that constituted the judgment for purposes of § 1961 .
The Court also finds the reasoning of Georgia Association of Retarded Citizens v. McDaniel, 855 F.2d 794 (11th Cir. 1988), persuasive. In McDaniel, the district court entered an order awarding a sum certain in costs, but later amended its order and the award of costs.  Id. at 795 . In its order amending the award of costs, the district court declared that the cost award was to bear interest from the date of judgment. Id . The defendants moved for reconsideration, prompting the district court to strike the portion of its order allowing for interest on costs. Id . On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit concluded that when a district court awards costs, interest accrues from the date of the original judgment.  Id. at 799 . The court went on to state that even when "an award of costs is modified by the district court, interest on the revised award should run from the date of the original award because that is the date on which the correct judgment should have been entered." Id . (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
Similar to the judgment in Mock that ascertained liability and thus was the trigger for postjudgment interest under § 1961 , the Court's judgment dated March 11, 2016, ascertained liability in this case. Indeed, from March 11, 2016, Apple Glen was entitled to a damages award under the Court's judgment. The March 11, 2016, judgment also quantified the damages due to Apple Glen and set the date from which prejudgment interest began to accrue. Even though the Court must now amend its judgment in order to reflect the applicable prejudgment interest rate, under the rationale of McDaniel, that does not affect the trigger point for purposes of § 1961 .
Furthermore, the Court notes that Apple Glen's reliance on SEB, 476 F.3d 1317 , is unpersuasive given the marked procedural differences. In SEB, a jury returned a verdict and the district court entered a judgment thereon, which included an award of prejudgment interest for the period between the date of the verdict and the date of the judgment.  Id. at 1318 . On the first appeal, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the jury verdict, but remanded with instructions for additional prejudgment interest. Id . On remand, the district court entered an amended judgment consistent with the Eleventh Circuit's mandate, but determined that prejudgment interest would accrue from its original judgment rather than the amended judgment.  Id. at 1319 .
On a second appeal, the Eleventh Circuit was confronted with two questions: "[*8] first, under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 37 , when postjudgment interest began to accrue; and second, whether prejudgment interest accrued until that date." Id . 
Rule 37 governs the award of postjudgment interest by a district court after an appeal. See Fed. R.App. P. 37 . When the appellate court affirms "a money judgment in a civil case," postjudgment interest "is payable from the date when the district court's [original] judgment was entered," unless the law provides otherwise. Fed. R.App. P. 37(a) . When the appellate court "modifies or reverses a judgment with a direction that money judgment be entered in the district court, the mandate [the appellate court issues] must contain instructions about the allowance of interest." Fed. R.App. P. 37(b) . "If the mandate is silent about interest, . . . the district court on remand has no choice but to begin postjudgment interest with entry of the postremand judgment." 20A James Wm. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice § 337.12[3] (3d ed.2006); accord 16A Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 3983 (3d ed.1999).
Id . 

After analyzing Rule 37 , the court determined that postjudgment interest began to accrue from the amended judgment because the appellate court had modified the original money judgment and was silent as to interest.  Id. at 1319-20 . Importantly, the court's holding in SEB was based on the plain language of Rule 37 . The court also determined that Florida law did not allow for a gap period between pre-and postjudgment interest, and thus prejudgment interest ran until the amended judgment.  Id. at 1320-21 .
In contrast to SEB, Rule 37 simply is not applicable to the instant action. The Eleventh Circuit has not affirmed, modified, or reversed the Court's original money judgment. And that is a paramount differentiation because Rule 37 carries with it the default rule that postjudgment interest accrues from the date of the amended judgment. Thus, with Rule 37 not in play neither is its companion default rule. In light of this procedural difference, SEB is not controlling or instructive here.
In sum, the Court determines that the judgment dated March 11, 2016, demarcates the point at which prejudgment interest ceases to accrue and postjudgment interest begins to accrue. That judgment found Apple Glen entitled to damages, quantified those damages, and determined when prejudgment interest would begin to accrue. In other words, the Court's March 11, 2016, judgment is a money judgment that meaningfully ascertained damages and thereby triggered postjudgment interest under § 1961 . Cf. Johansen, 170 F.3d at 1339 (noting that "[w]here the judgment is not supported by the evidence and is vacated and damages are determined at a new trial, the damages were not 'ascertained' in any meaningful way until the entry of the second judgment").
4. Calculation 
The annual interest rate is calculated by multiplying the judgment amount by the Default Rate; thus, the formula is $4,654,688.65x.18, which equals $837,843.96. To calculate the per diem interest rate, the annual interest rate is divided by 365; thus, the formula is $837,843.96/365, which equals $2,295.46. A total number of 710 days elapsed between April 1, 2014, [*9] and the Court's March 11, 2016, judgment. Therefore, the total prejudgment interest that has accrued is calculated by $2,295.46x710, which equals $1,629,776.60. Adding the accrued interest to the judgment amount results in a grand total of $6,284,465.25.
Accordingly, it is
ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED:
(1) Plaintiff Apple Glen Investors, L.P.'s Renewed Motion to Determine Amount of Prejudgment Interest and for Entry of Final Judgment (Doc. # 100) is GRANTED as provided above.
(2) The Clerk is directed to enter an amended judgment in favor of Plaintiff Apple Glen Investors, L.P. in a sum of $6,284,465.25 (representing $4,654,688.65 in damages and $1,629,776.60 in prejudgment interest), which shall accrue postjudgment interest at the federal statutory rate as prescribed by 28 U.S.C. § 1961 , for which sum let execution issue.
(3) This case was previously closed, and it shall remain so.

DONE and ORDERED in Chambers in Tampa, Florida, this 8th day of September, 2016.

VIRGINIA M. HERNANDEZ COVINGTON 
ORDER
This cause comes before the Court pursuant to Defendant Express Scripts, Inc.'s ("ESI") Motion to Exclude Expert Testimony of Gary Keene (Doc. # 39) and Motion to Exclude Expert Testimony of Brad Johnson (Doc. # 40), both filed on April 6, 2015. Plaintiff Apple Glen Investors, L.P. ("Apple Glen") filed responses thereto (Doc. ## 45, 46) on May 6, 2015. ESI filed replies to Plaintiff Apple Glen's responses (Doc. ## 48, 49) thereafter on May 20, 2015. For the reasons that follow, the Court denies the Motions without prejudice.
I. Background 
Pursuant to an agreement ("the Lease") dated December 6, 1999, Apple Glen leased commercial property and equipment to ESI. (Doc. # 2 at 2). Both parties at bar are successors in interest to the original parties of the Lease, which terminated on March 31, 2014. ( Id.) ESI took assignment of the Lease in November of 2001. (Doc. # 42 at 2).
On June 25, 2014, Apple Glen filed a complaint alleging that ESI breached the Lease by failing to maintain the entire leased premises, including leased equipment, in "first class condition and order of repair" and to "promptly make all repairs and replacements of every kind and nature, whether foreseen or unforeseen," pursuant to Section 12 of the Lease. (Doc. # 2 at ¶ 9). Apple Glen seeks damages in excess of $5.3 million dollars in repair and replacement costs, together with loss of rental income, diminution in marketability, and attorneys' fees. (Doc. # 42 at 17; Doc. # 2 at 4).
Apple Glen has retained a construction consultant, Gary Keene, to offer expert testimony at trial. Keene's Expert Report (Doc. # 42-1), deposition transcript (Doc. # 39-1), and affidavit (Doc. # 47-1), are before the Court. Apple Glen has also retained Brad Johnson, a managing director at a franchise appraisal firm, to provide expert testimony. Johnson's Expert Report (Doc. # 40-1) and deposition transcript (Doc. # 40-2) are before the Court. ESI moves to exclude the testimony of both proffered experts. (Doc. ## 39, 40). The Court will consider each motion in turn.
II. Legal Standard 
The admissibility of expert testimony is governed by Federal Rule of Evidence 702 , which states that:
A witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if:
(a) the expert's scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine [*2] a fact in issue;
(b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;
(c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and (d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.
Fed. R. Evid. 702 .

Rule 702 is a codification of the Court's landmark case of Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579 , 113 S. Ct. 2786 , 125 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1993). In Daubert, the Court described the gatekeeping function of the district court to "ensure that any and all scientific testimony or evidence is not only relevant, but reliable."  Id. at 589 . As stated in the Advisory Committee Notes accompanying Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence , "[a] review of the case law after Daubert shows that the rejection of expert testimony is the exception rather than the rule." See Advisory Committee Notes to the 2000 Amendment to Rule 702 . In addition, the trial judge is afforded broad discretion in deciding Daubert issues. See Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137 , 152 , 119 S. Ct. 1167 , 143 L. Ed. 2d 238 (1999).
When a matter is set for a bench trial, as in the present case, however, the Eleventh Circuit has commented that "[t]here is less need for the gatekeeper to keep the gate when the gatekeeper is keeping the gate only for himself." United States v. Brown, 415 F.3d 1257 , 1269 (11th Cir. 2005). The court has also remarked that judges serving as factfinders in the context of a bench trial are less likely than jurors to be "awestruck by the expert's mystique." Id . (citing Allison v. McGhan Med. Corp., 184 F.3d 1300 , 1310 (11th Cir. 1999)).
Nevertheless, in an abundance of caution, the Court will evaluate the proffered expert testimony against the touchstones of Daubert and Rule 702 . In Rink v. Cheminova, Inc., 400 F.3d 1286 (11th Cir. 2005), the Eleventh Circuit set forth a three-pronged approach to qualifying expert witnesses:
To fulfill their obligation under Daubert, district courts must engage in a rigorous inquiry to determine whether: (1) the expert is qualified to testify competently regarding the matters he intends to address; (2) the methodology by which the expert reaches his conclusions is sufficiently reliable as determined by the sort of inquiry mandated in Daubert; and (3) the testimony assists the trier of fact, through the application of scientific, technical, or specialized expertise, to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.
Id. at 1291-1292 (internal citations omitted). The party offering an expert has the burden of satisfying each of these elements by a preponderance of the evidence.  Id. at 1292 ; see also Allison, 184 F.3d at 1306 .

III. Analysis 
A. Gary Keene 
Apple Glen employed Keene, the principal of Keene Kilmas Consultant Group, LLC ("KKCG"), to evaluate the existing conditions of the leased premises and equipment. In the expert report, Keene lists conditions and specific items that he determines to be deficient and provides an "Opinion of Probable Cost" to refurbish or replace the items in order to restore the property to a "first class condition and order or repair," pursuant to the Lease. (Doc. # 42-1 at 4). Apple Glen seeks to use the testimony of Keene, speaking on behalf of KKCG, to allege deficient conditions for twenty-five items. ESI moves to exclude Keene's testimony under Daubert and Rule 702 .
According to Apple Glen, [*3] the qualifications and expertise of Keene, having over forty years of experience as a Certified General Contract and Construction Consultant, are "beyond reproach." (Doc. # 45 at 1). ESI does not challenge Keene's qualifications, but instead challenges Keene's methodology, contending that it is flawed and, thus, will not assist the trier of fact. (Doc. # 39 at 4).
Keene's Expert Report (Doc. # 42-1) describes his methodology as placing "an emphasis on determining if certain components could be refurbished or needed to be replaced so that the useful life of any given component would extend a minimum of 10 years; correlating to the term of the existing lease." ( Id. at 16). When asked during his deposition about this methodology, Keene stated, "we looked at equipment and components that would need to last a minimum of ten years to be in accordance with the lease." (Keene Dep. Doc. # 39-1 at 141). From this explanation, ESI contends that Keene based his report on a "10 year useful life criteria," which is not included in the Lease. (Doc. # 39 at 2). According to ESI, rather than being required to replace equipment that would need to last ten years, the Lease only provides that the tenant shall replace equipment that has "become worn out or unusable for the purpose which it is intended." ( Id.). ESI alleges that "Keene's entire analysis is based on a nonexistent contract term," and, thus, his methodology is flawed. ( Id.).
The Court is not convinced that the Expert Report, taken together with Keene's deposition, reveals a flawed methodology. The Expert Report alleges deficiencies that purportedly required action at the time of inspection, rather than compelling action within ten years. Keene's affidavit, filed in conjunction with Apple Glen's response to ESI's Daubert Motion, states that replacement was only suggested for items already beyond their useful life, regardless of whether their useful life would expire in the next ten years. (Doc # 47-1 at ¶ 15).
Even assuming arguendo that Keene's methodology was based on a "10 year useful life criteria," there is less need for the Court to exercise its gatekeeping function as to expert testimony for a bench trial. See Brown, 415 F.3d at 1269 . Given that this is a nuanced issue of interpretation, ESI can establish alleged flaws in Keene's methodology adequately through cross-examination. The Court therefore finds no basis for striking Keene's testimony prior to trial pursuant to ESI's Daubert and Rule 702 challenge. However, ESI may again move for exclusion of Keene's testimony if it can establish during the bench trial that Keene employed a flawed methodology.
In addition to challenging the substance of Keene's testimony, ESI suggests in its reply brief that Keene's affidavit, which was submitted in connection with Apple Glen's response to ESI's Motion for Summary Judgment, was untimely submitted and is a "sham" affidavit. ESI argues that the affidavit is inadmissible because it was filed after the discovery deadline and the supplemental disclosure deadline, which was March 30, 2015. (Doc. # 48 at 3-4). Although Keene's affidavit was filed on May 6, 2015, it does not [*4] appear that ESI was prejudiced by any belated disclosure. Keene's affidavit is an explanatory submission tendered by an expert who was known to ESI and whose expert report was filed timely. The Court does not find that Keene's affidavit would surprise ESI such that it would give Apple Glen an unfair advantage.
ESI also insinuates that Keene's affidavit should be excluded as a sham, citing Kernel Records Oy v. Mosley, 694 F.3d 1294 , 1303 n.6 (11th Cir. 2012), for the proposition that a "district court may disregard an affidavit as a sham when a party to the suit files an affidavit that contradicts, without explanation, prior deposition testimony on a material fact." (Doc. # 48 at 4). However, that case also states that the "sham affidavit rule should be applied sparingly." Id . (citing Latimer v. Roaring Toyz, Inc., 601 F.3d 1224 , 1237 (11th Cir. 2010)). In order to strike an affidavit as a sham, the Court "must find 'some inherent inconsistency' between an affidavit and the affiant's sworn testimony." Mortg. Payment Prot., Inc. v. Cynosure Fin., Inc., No. 6:08-cv-1212, [2011 BL 179658], 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73747 , 2011 WL 2670081 , at *4 (M.D. Fla. July 8, 2011) (quoting Tippens v. Celotex Corp., 805 F.2d 949 , 954 (11th Cir. 1986)).
This is not such a case where the sham affidavit rule should be applied, as Keene's affidavit acts to clarify his expert report, rather than to contradict it. The Court finds that the affidavit does not modify the prior expert report and deposition to the extent that it creates an inherent inconsistency. The Court accordingly declines to employ the draconian sanction of striking Keene's affidavit.
B. Brad Johnson 
Retained by Apple Glen, Brad Johnson states in his Expert Report that the purpose of his retention is to:
a. Discuss the differences between a net lease and an absolute net lease and the significance of those differences, including related trends in the commercial real estate market
b. To review the subject Lease
c. Inspect the subject Leased Premises
d. Confer with construction consultants and the Maintenance Director
e. To consult with other real estate professionals knowledgeable about real estate leasing and telecommunications infrastructure buildings
f. To offer guidance on the expectations and obligations of the parties to an absolute net lease
(Doc. # 40-1 at 1).

ESI seeks an order excluding Johnson's testimony under Daubert and Rule 702 arguing that Johnson's testimony will not aid the trier of fact. Johnson's qualifications are uncontested. ESI's contention that the testimony will not aid the trier of fact is premised on the claim that Johnson's role is actually to interpret the unambiguous Lease, which is a question of law for the Court. (Doc. # 40 at 2). ESI cites Johnson's deposition in which he states he was "essentially" asked to determine whether the tenant had complied with the lease. (See  Id. at 1-2). Apple Glen counters that it plans to utilize Johnson's expertise to compare and contrast the Lease at bar to other types of commercial leases, highlighting that this particular Lease agreement is "extraordinary and unique." (Doc. # 46 at 2). Apple Glen underscores that "it shall not call Johnson as a witness at trial to offer legal opinions." ( Id.).
While ESI is correct [*5] in stating that an expert may not "merely tell the jury what result to reach," (Doc. # 40 at 2 (citing Montgomery v. Aetna Cas. Sur. Co., 898 F.2d 1537 , 1541 (11th Cir. 1990)), the danger involved with such expert testimony, namely that the jury will be unduly influenced, is not implicated in a bench trial. See Brown, 415 F.3d at 1269 . The Court is confident that it can discern testimony that seeks to make legal conclusions from testimony that "provides the Court with background, context and industry knowledge that are traditionally supplied by experts." (Doc. # 46 at 2). Given that Johnson is not a lawyer, there is even less risk that any potential legal analysis will influence the Court. Testimony that offers legal conclusions will be afforded no weight. As such, the Court denies ESI's Motion to Exclude Johnson's testimony. However, ESI may, if appropriate, re-articulate its challenge during the course of the trial.
Accordingly, it is
ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED:
Defendant Express Scripts, Inc.'s Motion to Exclude Expert Testimony of Gary Keene (Doc. # 39) and Motion to Exclude Expert Testimony of Brad Johnson (Doc. # 40) are DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
DONE and ORDERED in Chambers, in Tampa, Florida, this 15th day of June, 2015.

WILLIAM MATTHEWMAN 
ORDER DENYING PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR SANCTIONS AGAINST DEFENDANT, DANIEL LEYDEN [DE 200]
THIS CAUSE is before the Court upon Plaintiff, Living Color Enterprises, Inc.'s ("Plaintiff") Motion for Sanctions against Defendant, Daniel Leyden ("Motion") [DE 200]. This matter was referred to the undersigned by United States District Judge Kenneth A. Marra [DE 205]. Defendant, Daniel Leyden ("Defendant") has filed a response to the Motion [DE 203], and Plaintiff has filed a reply [DE 204]. The parties have also submitted supplemental memoranda [DEs 230, 231]. This matter is now ripe for review.
I. BACKGROUND 
A. The Prior Discovery Motion 
In an Order dated February 1, 2016 [DE 191], the Court granted Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Production of Documents [DE 162], as modified by Plaintiff's Response to Order Requiring Response [DE 175]. The Court ordered that Defendant file, on or before February 4, 2016, an affidavit in which he stated, under oath, whether or not he possessed any additional text messages or emails that he had not yet produced to Plaintiff between himself and Mark Vera, between himself and Defendant New Era Aquaculture, Ltd., between himself and Peter Kersh and/or between himself and Tom Noble from the time period of January 1, 2013, through the present. [DE 191]. The Court further ordered that, if Defendant did not possess any additional emails or text messages, he should explain in the affidavit why he did not possess them and what efforts he had undertaken in order to attempt to recover any such emails or text messages. Id. Finally, the Court required that Defendant state in the affidavit on or about which dates he had obtained new cell phones between January 1, 2013, and the present. Id. 
On February 3, 2016, Defendant filed his affidavit [DE 194]. Defendant attested that he has not had access to the Living Color email server since September 2014. Id. at ¶ 3. He explained that a search of his personal email revealed one email dated September 25, 2014, between Defendant and John O'Rourke that had not previously been [*2] produced by Defendant to Plaintiff. Id. at ¶¶ 4-5. A copy of that email was attached to the affidavit. Defendant attested that he had searched his cellular telephone for all text messages exchanged with Mark Vera, John O'Rourke, Julia Vera, Tom Noble and/or Peter Kersh and had only recovered text message exchanges between himself and Mark Vera between January 16, 2016, and the present. Id. at ¶ 10. Defendant stated that he had provided those text messages to his attorney so that they could be turned over to Plaintiff's counsel. Id. Defendant explained that Mark Vera had archived text message exchanges from his own phone onto his computer, that Mr. Vera had delivered all of the text message exchanges to his attorney for delivery to Plaintiff's counsel, and that Defendant believes that these archived text messages constitute all messages exchanged between Defendant and Mr. Vera during the requested period of time. Id. at ¶¶ 11-12. Defendant stated that he did not use text messaging to communicate with Peter Kersh or anyone at New Era, but that he may have texted Tom Noble "on a handful of occasions at trade shows in the United States to locate him at the show or hotel. I no longer have any such text messages." Id. at ¶ 13. Finally, Defendant explained that he replaced his cellular phone in September 2014 and July 2015, that he did not archive or save text messages on his phones when they were replaced, and that it is his "usual practice to periodically remove text message exchanges from [his] phone to maintain the operational speed and efficiency of [his] phone." Id. at ¶¶ 14-15.
B. The Pending Motion for Sanctions 
On February 5, 2016, Plaintiff filed its Motion [DE 200]. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant knowingly destroyed evidence and is seeking the entry of an Order striking Defendant's pleadings, the entry of a default judgment in Plaintiff's favor due to Defendant's conduct in this case, requiring an adverse interest instruction against Defendant, awarding reasonable attorney's fees and costs caused by Defendant's failure to comply with the Court's Order, and awarding such further and other relief as the Court deems just and proper. Id. at pp. 1, 5. Plaintiff asserts that Defendant had an obligation to preserve his text messages and that he destroyed them.  Id. at p. 2. Plaintiff also contends that Defendant did not state in his affidavit whether he searched his second personal email address.  Id. at p. 3. Next, Plaintiff argues that all elements of spoliation are met here because the Defendant's affidavit establishes that there is missing evidence that existed at one time, Defendant had an ongoing duty to preserve the relevant text messages, Defendant's participation in the scheme outlined in the Second Amended Complaint is crucial to Plaintiff's claims against Defendant, the destroyed evidence would have established that Defendant was involved in the scheme to misappropriate Plaintiff's business and customers, and Defendant purposefully destroyed the evidence.  Id. at p. 4. Plaintiff maintains that Aqua-Tech's production of text messages does not [*3] cure Defendant's misconduct. Id. at pp. 4-5.
In response, Defendant contends that he has always used the cell phone feature that automatically deletes text messages after 30 days and that he, admittedly, neglected to disable the feature when the lawsuit was filed. [DE 203 at p. 3]. Defendant explains that Plaintiff now has in its possession voluminous text messages between Defendant and Mark Vera despite Defendant's inability to produce the text messages himself.  Id. at p. 2. Next, Defendant states that he only has one personal email address and that Plaintiff is incorrect in its allegation that he has two. Id. at pp. 2-3. Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot establish the requisite elements for spoliation because it cannot show that the missing evidence is crucial to its ability to prove its prima facie claims or that Defendant acted in bad faith by neglecting to archive or save the text messages. Id. at pp. 4-6. Defendant concedes, however, that the deleted text messages once existed and that he had a duty to preserve relevant evidence when the lawsuit was filed in October 2014.  Id. at p. 4. Defendant asserts that Plaintiff has not shown that Defendant deleted any emails or text messages in bath faith or "as an affirmative act to destroy or conceal evidence that would support or assist the Plaintiff's case."  Id. at p. 6. Further, Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot show bad faith based on circumstantial evidence because Plaintiff cannot show that Defendant engaged in an affirmative act causing the evidence to be lost or that his actions cannot be credibly explained as not involving bad faith. Id. at pp. 7-8.
In its reply, Plaintiff first emphasizes that Defendant's affidavit does not mention the auto-delete feature on his phone and that, even if Defendant's text messages did automatically delete, he should have turned the feature off, especially when he realized that the text messages were at issue in the litigation. [DE 204 at pp. 2 , 4]. Plaintiff asserts that it is still missing the text messages between Defendant and other important individuals, even if Aqua Tech has turned over some of its text messages involving Defendant. Id. Plaintiff contends that Defendant has not truly shown that he does not have a second personal email address.  Id. at p. 3. It insists that "[t]his Court should not be required to rely on Leyden's superficial summary and analysis of the breadth and relevance of his text messages. The destroyed evidence...is crucial to proving Living Color's claims and negative inferences should be drawn for Leyden's failure to produce same."  Id. at p. 4. Finally, Plaintiff argues that Defendant has a "penchant for misleading Living Color and this Court about the facts of this case and the reasons why he is unable to produce relevant communications. That fact coupled with his text message exchanges with Aqua Tech in which the two attempt to reconcile their stories, leads to the inevitable conclusion that Leyden has been acting in bad faith."  Id. at p. 5.
C. Parties' Initial Failure to Discuss Recently Amended Rule 37(e) 
After reviewing Plaintiff'[*4] s Motion for Sanctions against Defendant Daniel Leyden, Defendant's Response, and Plaintiff's Reply, the Court noticed that the parties had failed to address the effect of the recently amended Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(e) on this matter which deals with the alleged spoliation of electronically stored information ("ESI"). The Court, therefore, issued an Order requiring supplemental briefing [DE 227]. Both parties complied and filed supplemental memorandum [DEs 230, 231].
In Defendant's supplemental brief, he argues that Rule 37(e) does apply to this matter and that the Eleventh Circuit case law has been superseded by the amended rule. [DE 230, pp. 1-2]. He concedes that the information sought was electronically stored information, that he had a duty to preserve evidence starting on September 5, 2014, and that he negligently failed to preserve the ESI. Id. at pp. 2-4. Defendant argues, however, that the ESI has been replaced because Plaintiff has received the ESI from another source. Id. at pp. 4-6. He also contends that Plaintiff has not been prejudiced because Defendant had no duty to preserve until September 5, 2014, and Plaintiff's claims are based upon conduct that occurred before September 26, 2014. Id. at pp. 6-7. Defendant contends that Plaintiff was also not prejudiced because Aqua Tech provided the missing text messages to Plaintiff.  Id. at p. 7. Finally, he explains that there is no evidence that Defendant intentionally lost the ESI. Id. at pp. 7-8.
Plaintiff argues in its supplemental brief that the newly amended Rule 37(e) does apply in this case, and that sanctions should be imposed under the rule. [DE 231 at pp. 1-2 ]. Plaintiff asserts that Defendant failed to take reasonable steps to preserve ESI that cannot be restored or replaced through additional discovery.  Id. at p. 3, fn. 1. Plaintiff explains that a subpoena to Defendant's cell phone carrier yielded no results and that Plaintiff is still entitled to "other communications that Leyden had with other potential witnesses regarding the circumstances at issue in this case. Id. Next, Plaintiff asserts that Defendant's policy to delete text messages is an "affirmative, intentional, and, frankly cavalier act and places Leyden's actions squarely within the sanctionable conduct of Rule 37(e)(2) ."  Id. at p. 3. Plaintiff maintains that, even if the Court finds that Defendant acted negligently rather than intentionally, the Court should impose sanctions under Rule 37(e)(1) because Plaintiff was prejudiced by the missing text messages. Id. at pp. 4-5.
II. ANALYSIS
Plaintiff's Motion alleges the destruction or spoliation of Defendant's text messages. "Spoliation is the destruction or significant alteration of evidence, or the failure to preserve property for another's use as evidence in pending or reasonably foreseeable litigation." Graff v. Baja Marine Corp., 310 Fed.Appx. 298 , 301 (11th Cir.2009) (quoting West v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 167 F.3d 776 , 779 (2d Cir.1999)). As of December 1, 2015, when considering a claim of spoliation in a case involving ESI, courts look to the newly amended Rule 37(e) .1 As text messages constitute electronically stored information, the newly amended [*5] Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(e) applies in this case. See, e.g., Marten Transport, Ltd. v. Plattform Advertising, Inc., Case No. 14-cv-02464-JWL-TJJ, [2016 BL 34879], 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15098 , 2016 WL 492743 , at *4 (D. Kan. Feb. 8, 2016).
A. Rule 37(e) 
Recently amended Rule 37(e) states that if "electronically stored information that should have been preserved in the anticipation or conduct of litigation is lost because a party failed to take reasonable steps to preserve it, and it cannot be restored or replaced through additional discovery, the court may take certain actions. The new version of Rule 37(e) next states that the court:
(1) upon finding prejudice to another party from loss of the information, may order measures no greater than necessary to cure the prejudice; or
(2) only upon finding that the party acted with the intent to deprive another party of the information's use in the litigation may:
(A) presume that the lost information was unfavorable to the party;
(B) instruct the jury that it may or must presume the information was unfavorable to the party; or
(C) dismiss the action or enter a default judgment.
The Advisory Committee's notes to the 2015 amendment explain that the newly amended rule forecloses reliance on inherent authority or state law to determine when certain measures would be used."2 Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(e) Advisory Committee's notes to 2015 amendment.

B. Preliminary Spoliation Questions 
When confronted with a spoliation claim, the Court must first make some preliminary determinations under Rule 37(e) before turning to subsections (e)(1) or (e)(2) .
Does the alleged spoliation involve ESI? 
If the alleged spoliation involves ESI, then Rule 37(e) applies. In this case, the alleged spoliated items were text messages, which constitute ESI. Therefore, the Court must proceed to the next step and answer the following three questions under Rule 37(e) :
(1) Was the allegedly spoliated ESI evidence that should have been preserved? 
Rule 37(e) does not set forth a standard for preservation and does not alter existing federal law as to whether evidence should have been preserved or when the duty to preserve attaches.3 In the Eleventh Circuit, the test is whether litigation was "pending or reasonably foreseeable" when the spoliation occurred. Graff v. Baja Marine Corp., supra , 310 Fed. Appx. at 301 . Rule 37(e) does not apply, therefore, when information or evidence is lost before a duty to preserve attaches. In this case, Defendant concedes that certain text messages should have been preserved in relation to this litigation, at least starting on September 5, 2014, and that the evidence—the deleted text messages—did once exist. Thus, it is clear in this case that the ESI should have been preserved in the conduct of this litigation.
(2) Was the allegedly spoliated ESI lost because a party failed to take reasonable steps to preserve it? 
The sanctions or curative measures under Rule 37(e) are available only if ESI that should have been preserved "is lost." According to the Advisory Committee Notes: "Because electronically store information often exists in multiple locations, loss from one source may be harmless when substitute information can be found elsewhere." In the instant case, it appears that [*6] the great majority of Defendant's text messages were provided to Plaintiff by another party. Accordingly, the great majority of Defendant's text messages were not "lost", and sanctions under Rule 37(e) are simply not available in relation to those text messages. However, since it appears that at least some of the text messages at issue were not replaced and were therefore lost, the Court will continue the analysis under Rule 37(e) and proceed to the third preliminary question. 
(3) Is the allegedly spoliated ESI evidence that cannot be restored or replaced through additional discovery? 
Rule 37(e) precludes any sanctions or curative measures if the ESI can be restored or replaced through additional discovery. Here, the missing text messages between Defendant and certain individuals cannot be restored or replaced through additional discovery. Plaintiff has already subpoenaed Defendant's cell phone provider, and the provider was unable to provide any additional information. The answer to the question is, therefore, "yes", that is, the allegedly spoliated ESI cannot be restored or replaced through additional discovery. 
The answers to the above questions determine the Court's next step 
If the answer to any of questions 1-3 is "no", then the Court need proceed no further under Rule 37(e) , and a motion for spoliation sanctions or curative measures must be denied. If the answer to all three of the questions is "yes", however, then the Court must analyze the facts at hand under subsection (e)(1) if there is a finding of "prejudice" or under subsection (e)(2) if there is a finding of "intent to deprive." Since, in this case, the answer to question 1 is "yes", the answer to question 2 is yes (in part), and the answer to question 3 is "yes", the Court will next analyze both the (e)(1) and (e)(2) factors. 
C. Rule 37(e)(1) 
With respect to Rule 37(e)(1) , the committee notes explain the following regarding the "prejudice" language in the rule:
The rule does not place a burden of proving or disproving prejudice on one party or the other. Determining the content of lost information may be a difficult task in some cases, and placing the burden of proving prejudice on the party that did not lose the information may be unfair. In other situations, however, the content of the lost information may be fairly evident, the information may appear to be unimportant, or the abundance of preserved information may appear sufficient to meet the needs of all parties. Requiring the party seeking curative measures to prove prejudice may be reasonable in such situations. The rule leaves judges with discretion to determine how best to assess prejudice in particular cases.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(e) advisory committee's notes to 2015 amendment. Additionally, in the Eleventh Circuit, "prejudice" was already a factor in assessing whether spoliation sanctions are appropriate. See, e.g., McLeod v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 515 F.App'x 806 , 808 (11th Cir. 2013).

Here, the Court sees no prejudice suffered by Plaintiff. And, if there was any prejudice to Plaintiff at all, it was so minimal that the Court does not find it necessary to order measures to cure the alleged prejudice. [*7] Plaintiff argues in its Motion that "Leyden's participation in the scheme outlined in the Second Amended Complaint [D.E. 118] is crucial to Plaintiff's claims against Leyden and the evidence would have established he was involved in the scheme to misappropriate Plaintiff's business and customers." [DE 200 at p. 4].4 This is an extremely conclusory statement that really does not establish any prejudice to Plaintiff. Plaintiff has not explained any direct nexus between the missing text messages and the allegations in its Complaint.
In Plaintiff's supplemental brief, it argues that, due to the spoliation of evidence, Plaintiff does not know when and how Aqua Tech and Defendant met. [DE 231 at pp. 4-5]. Plaintiff does not explain how the missing text messages would establish this fact. Additionally, it appears that the vast majority of the missing text messages have been provided to Plaintiff by Aqua Tech and so they are not truly "lost." The asserted loss of the few remaining text messages, between Defendant and individuals named "Peter" and "Paul", has not truly prejudiced Plaintiff as the Court finds Defendant's description of the missing text messages to be credible and therefore finds that the content of the text messages would not have been relevant in this case. The asserted missing text messages appear to be unimportant, and the abundance of preserved information appears sufficient to meet the needs of Plaintiff. The Court does not find spoliation sanctions to be proper pursuant to Rule 37(e)(1) . 
D. Rule 37(e)(2) 
Next, the Court shall consider the "intent to deprive" standard laid out in Rule 37(e)(2) , which permits more severe spoliation sanctions.5 The committee notes explain that the amended Rule is intended to reject cases in certain Circuits that "authorize the giving of adverse-inference instructions on a finding of negligence or gross negligence." Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(e) advisory committee's notes to 2015 amendment.
In the case at hand, the Court does not find any direct evidence of either "intent to deprive" or bad faith.6 In Defendant's affidavit, he stated that he regularly deletes text messages in order to keep his phone running efficiently. In Defendant's response to the Motion, defense counsel explained that Defendant had activated a setting on his phone prior to this litigation that automatically deletes text messages after 30 days. While Plaintiff believes that the two explanations in Defendant's affidavit and response to Plaintiff's Motion are vastly different, the Court does not. It appears that defense counsel was simply expanding upon Defendant's explanation of how he manages his text messages. Regardless, it is common practice amongst many cell phone users to delete text messages as they are received or soon thereafter. There is nothing nefarious about such a routine practice under the facts presented here.
While Defendant clearly had an obligation to retain the relevant text messages after this lawsuit was initiated, the Court finds that Defendant simply acted negligently in erasing the text messages either actively [*8] or passively. Defendant is an individual who appears to be a relatively unsophisticated litigant. At worst, his actions were negligent. The amended Rule 37(e) does not permit an adverse inference instruction or other severe sanctions for negligence. There is no evidence that Defendant intentionally deleted the text messages in order to deprive Plaintiff of the information's use in litigation. There is no evidence that he intended to deprive Plaintiff of the text messages or that he acted in bad faith. No sanctions should be imposed pursuant to Rule 37(e)(2) . 
E. Second Personal Email Address 
Finally, Plaintiff raises an issue pertaining to the prior discovery motion, asserting that Defendant failed to search his second personal email address. However, the Court does not see any merit in Plaintiff's argument. The Court believes, based on Defendant's explanation in his response to the Motion, that the two personal email addresses belonging to Defendant are interchangeable, and Plaintiff has not provided any evidence whatsoever that they are not or that additional relevant emails exist in the alleged second email account. Defendant has not committed any discovery violation in this regard. Moreover, to the extent that Plaintiff may be indirectly seeking spoliation sanctions or other sanctions based upon the asserted failure of Defendant to search all of his email addresses, the Court denies any such requested relief for the same reasons that spoliation sanctions should not be awarded regarding the text messages.
III. CONCLUSION
In light of the foregoing, it is ORDERED and ADJUDGED that Plaintiff's Motion for Sanctions against Defendant, Daniel Leyden [DE 200] is DENIED.
DONE AND ORDERED in Chambers at West Palm Beach, Palm Beach County, Florida, this 22nd day of March, 2016.

The Motion for Sanctions in this case was filed after December 1, 2015. Regardless, even if the Motion had been filed prior to the amendment taking effect, "[u]nder 28 U.S.C. § 2074(a) and the Supreme Court orders dated April 29, 2015, the amendments govern all proceedings commenced on or after December 1, 2015, and all proceedings then pending 'insofar as just and practicable.'" Marten Transport, Ltd. v. Plattform Advertising, Inc., Case No. 14-cv-02464-JWL-TJJ, [2016 BL 34879], 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15098 , 2016 WL 492743 , at n.10 (D. Kan. Feb. 8, 2016). The Court finds it just and practicable to rely upon the newly amended Rule 37(e) in this case.

fn 
2
Newly amended Rule 37(e) specifically relates solely to ESI and not to non-ESI such as tangible documents or evidence. One question that will surely arise in the future is whether there are now two standards for spoliation depending on whether the allegedly spoliated item constitutes ESI or non-ESI. Clearly, when confronting a spoliation claim in an ESI case, a court must first look to newly amended Rule 37(e) and disregard prior spoliation case law based on "inherent authority" which conflicts with the standards established in Rule 37(e) . But in non-ESI spoliation claims involving a tangible document or evidence, do courts continue to rely on "inherent authority" and spoliation case law, even if the standards differ from the new spoliation standards established in Rule 37(e) ? That issue will have to be addressed and resolved by the various Circuits as spoliation case law develops in light of the newly amended Rule 37(e) . See, e.g. Best Payphones, Inc. v. City of New York, 1-CV-3924(JG)(VMS); 1-CV-8506(JG)(VMS); 3-CV-0192(JG)(VMS), [2016 BL 61617], 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25655 , 2016 WL 792396 , at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 26, 2016) ("Thus as the law currently exists in the Second Circuit, there are separate legal analyses governing the spoliation of tangible evidence versus electronic evidence.").

fn

The Advisory Committee notes do explain, however: "Due to the ever-increasing volume of electronically stored information and the multitude of devices that generate such information, perfection in preserving all relevant electronically stored information is often impossible.... This rule recognizes that 'reasonable steps' to preserve suffice; it does not call for perfection. The court should be sensitive to the party's sophistication with regard to litigation in evaluating preservation efforts; some litigants, particularly individual litigants, may be less familiar with preservation obligations than others who have considerable experience in litigation." Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(e) Advisory Committee's notes to 2015 amendment.

fn

In its reply, Plaintiff makes a similarly conclusory statement: "This Court should not be required to rely on Leyden's superficial summary and analysis of the breadth and relevance of his text messages. The destroyed evidence consisting of Leyden's communications with Tom Noble and other third parties is crucial to proving Living Color's claims and negative inferences should be drawn for Leyden's failure to produce same " [DE 204 at p. 4].

fn 
5
While (e)(2) does permit more severe spoliation standards, the Advisory Committee was careful to explain that courts "should exercise caution, however, in using the measures specified in (e)(2) . Finding an intent to deprive another party of the lost information's use in the litigation does not require a court to adopt any of the measures listed in subdivision (e)(2) . The remedy should fit the wrong, and the severe measures authorized by this subdivision should not be used when the information lost was relatively unimportant or lesser measures such as those specified in subdivision (e)(1) would be sufficient to redress the loss." Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(e) Advisory Committee's notes to 2015 amendment.

fn 
6
It appears to this Court that the "intent to deprive" standard in Rule 37(e)(2) may very well be harmonious with the "bad faith" standard previously established by the Eleventh Circuit. See Managed Care, supra. The "bad faith" standard has caused some confusion among district courts in the Eleventh Circuit, but one such court in a recent opinion dealing with spoliation of non-ESI material, after analyzing the issue at length, concluded that "bad faith", in the spoliation context, means "culpability and resulting prejudice" without any finding of "malice" necessary. See Austrum v. Fed. Cleaning Contractors, Inc., Case No.: 14-cv-81245-KAM, [2016 BL 4944], 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2261 , 2016 WL 93404 , at *6 (S.D. Fla. Jan. 8, 2016). However, the effect, if any, that recently amended Rule 37(e) has on Circuit case law in non-ESI spoliation cases remains to be determined in an appropriate case. See fn 2, supra.

Jonathan Goodman 
ORDER ON PLAINTIFF'S TWO MOTIONS TO COMPEL DEPOSITIONS
"Please, sir, I want some more."
Nine-year-old Oliver, in Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist, Ch. 2 (1838).
Plaintiff Procaps S.A. ("Procaps") has filed two discovery motions in which it wants more depositions. In particular, Procaps wants another deposition of defendant Patheon Inc.'s ("Patheon") 30(b)(6) representative and wants Court approval to exceed the 10-deposition limit and to compel more depositions. [ECF Nos. 340; 350]. Patheon opposes Procaps' motions. [ECF No. 375]. Procaps filed an omnibus reply, and, with the Court's approval, Patheon filed a sur-reply and Procaps filed a sur-sur-reply. [ECF Nos. 394; 398; 403; 418].
Unlike the fictional Oliver, who was suffering the torture of slow starvation, Procaps has feasted on a healthy discovery diet and cannot be said to be malnourished for discovery. Nevertheless, for the reasons outlined below, the Court grants in small part and denies in large part Procaps' two discovery motions. The Court declines to award fees to either party under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37 .
I. Procaps' Motion to Compel Another 30(b)(6) Deposition [ECF No. 340] 
A. Background 
On November 25, 2013, Procaps took the deposition of Patheon's 30(b)(6) representative, Geoffrey Glass ("Glass"), on 27 designated areas of inquiry. [ECF No. 340, p. 2]. Procaps filed the instant motion more than three months later, on February 28, 2014, alleging that Glass did not testify adequately on 7 of the 27 designated areas of inquiry. [ Id. at pp. 3-6]. Procaps asks the Court to compel Patheon to produce an adequately prepared 30(b)(6) representative to testify on these seven areas of inquiry at a reconvened deposition. [ Id. at p. 6]. Procaps also seeks attorney's fees and costs for Patheon's Rule 30(b)(6) violation. [ Id.].
Patheon argues that Procaps' motion should be denied because it is untimely under Local Rule 26.1(h) and because Glass was adequately prepared and sufficiently testified on the areas of inquiry in dispute. [ECF No. 375, pp. 8-11]. Patheon also notes that, in the meet and conferrals leading [*2] to this motion, it offered to produce Glass again on some of the seven areas of inquiry, but Procaps declined that offer. [ Id. at p. 10, n. 10; see also ECF No. 375-16, pp. 5-8].
In response to the argument that its motion is untimely, Procaps raises several reasons (discussed in detail below) why its delay is excused. [ECF No. 340, pp. 5-6; 394, p. 6]. Procaps also disagrees that Glass sufficiently testified on the areas of inquiry in dispute. [ECF No. 394, p. 6].
B. Applicable Legal Standard for Timely Filing Discovery Motions 
Local Rule 26.1 provides in relevant part:
Time for Filing. All motions related to discovery . . . shall be filed within thirty (30) days of the occurrence of grounds for the motion. Failure to file a discovery motion within thirty (30) days, absent a showing of reasonable cause for a later filing, may constitute a waiver of the relief sought.
Local Rule 26.1(h)(1) (emphasis added).

The Local Rule "reflects a policy of promoting the prompt resolution of discovery disputes by requiring the parties to timely bring to the court's attention matters that the parties cannot resolve amongst themselves." Kendall Lakes Towers Condo. Ass'n, Inc. v. Pac. Ins. Co., No. 10-24310-CIV, [2011 BL 421756], 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 138953 , 2011 WL 6190160 , at *2 (S.D. Fla. Dec. 2, 2011). Consequently, there is a presumption that the failure to timely file the discovery motion may constitute a waiver of the relief sought. In re Brican Am. LLC Equip. Lease Litig., No. 10-MD-02183, [977 F. SUPP. 2D 1287], 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 142841 , 2013 WL 5519980 , at *4 (S.D. Fla. Oct. 1, 2013). That presumptive waiver, however, may be overcome upon a "showing of reasonable cause for" the delay. Id . Nevertheless, the Local Rule "is permissive and affords the Court discretion in whether to consider a late-filed motion." Sandalwood Estates Homeowner's Ass'n, Inc. v. Empire Indem. Ins. Co., No. 09-CV-80787, [2010 BL 19700], 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12840 , 2010 WL 411088 , at *2 (S.D. Fla. Jan. 29, 2010).
C. Discussion 
Glass' 30(b)(6) deposition took place on November 25, 2013. [ECF No. 340-1, p. 1]. Procaps, however, did not raise the sufficiency of the deposition until mid-February and did not file its motion until the end of February — well beyond Local Rule 26.1(h) 's 30-day requirement. [ECF Nos. 340; 340-3, p. 7]. Procaps concedes that its motion is untimely, but presents six reasons why its delay should be excused. [ECF No. 340, p. 6; 394, p. 6]. The Court does not find these reasons to meet the "reasonable cause" showing required under the Local Rule to justify the late filing.
Three of Procaps' six reasons are not logical. First, Procaps asserts that its delay in filing was justified, in part, because of its "scheduling concessions throughout this litigation," but does not further explain how or why that is the case. Second, Procaps contends that Patheon's delay in producing two other deponents for depositions until February 2014 justifies its delay. Procaps, however, does not explain how these two depositions logically justify its delay to compel a completely separate deposition. Third, Procaps' argument that its delay was justified because Patheon obtained the same relief when the Court ordered Procaps to produce two deponents misses the mark. Those two depositions were compelled because of Procaps' counsel's improper deposition objections, not because of the inadequacy of the deponent'[*3] s answers. [ECF No. 252].
Procaps' other three reasons, while logically related to the relief it requests, also fail. First, Procaps' argument that Patheon's failure to designate a substitute 30(b)(6) deponent justifies its late filing is unavailing. How was Patheon supposed to know Procaps was going to seek to depose Glass again until Procaps raised the issue more than two months later? Second, Procaps contends that Patheon waived the right to challenge Procaps' late filing by agreeing to produce Glass on some areas of inquiry. Procaps' contention is contradicted by the record. In the same meet and confer email where Patheon's counsel offered to produce Glass again on some areas of inquiry, the first paragraph of that email raises the issue of Procaps' failure to timely file its motion and requests an explanation. [ECF No. 375-16, p. 5]. Third, Procaps argues that Patheon will not suffer prejudice if it is required to produce a designee for another 30(b)(6) deposition. The Court finds that Patheon would suffer some prejudice. In particular, Procaps seeks a 30(b)(6) deposition, not a fact witness deposition. As such, Patheon must incur substantial time and effort in preparing Glass, or another 30(b)(6) deponent.1 
Finally, this has been/is a highly contested case. Put another way, the parties have not been shy about seeking Court intervention and the Court has been more than accommodating in holding hearings to assist the parties. Indeed, between Glass' November 25, 2013 deposition until February 28, 2014, the date of Procaps' motion, there were over 100 filings and 3 hearings. Procaps has not sufficiently explained why it did not raise this issue sooner in light of the myriad other discovery issues that were brought before the Court.
Accordingly, based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Procaps' motion is untimely and that Procaps has not shown reasonable cause for the delay. Consequently, the Court denies Procaps the specific relief it requests in its motion. See Manno v. Healthcare Revenue Recovery Grp., LLC, No. 11-61357-CIV, [2012 BL 428824], 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56272 , 2012 WL 1409532 , at *3 (S.D. Fla. Apr. 23, 2012).
Nevertheless, even though the Court is denying the motion, the Court is going to provide some relief to Procaps. In offering to produce Glass again on some areas of inquiry, Patheon conceded that Glass did not adequately respond to certain questions in some of the areas of inquiry in dispute. The Court has reviewed all of Glass' deposition testimony that the parties have submitted and agrees that Glass' testimony on some of the areas of inquiry was less than sufficient. As such, the Court will allow Procaps, if it chooses, to depose Glass, or another 30(b)(6) representative, subject to the following:
1. The deposition will occur by videoconference or at a location convenient for Patheon's 30(b)(6) representative, and will be for no more than one hour; 
2. The deposition shall be limited to the specific questions Procaps identified [ECF No. 375-16, pp. 10-11] that Glass did not answer in areas of inquiry 5, 20, and 24, and the logically and closely-related follow-up questions flowing from the 30(b)(6) deponent's answers to those [*4] limited questions at the reconvened deposition;
3. The reconvened deposition shall take place within the next two weeks. The Court trusts counsel to work out an amicable time and date for the deposition; and
4. Each party will be responsible for its fees and costs in taking the deposition.
D. Conclusion 
While the Court is denying Procaps' motion as untimely, it is providing it with some of the relief it requested in its motion. Consequently, the Court declines to enter an award of attorney's fees on this motion.
II. Procaps' Motion for Additional Depositions [ECF No. 350] 
A. Background 
Procaps seeks to compel Patheon to produce the following deponents: Kevin Zamora ("Zamora"); Peter Bigelow ("Bigelow"); a 30(b)(6) Patheon representative on electronically stored information (the "ESI Representative"); and Michel Lagarde ("Lagarde"). [ECF No. 350, p. 2]. Procaps complains that Patheon invoked Rule 30(a) 's 10-deposition limit rule to prevent these depositions, despite earlier confirming that these depositions would take place. [Id.]. Procaps contends that Patheon waived the right to invoke Rule 30(a) and that it should be allowed to take these additional depositions because they are justified and necessary.
In response, Patheon points out that Zamora's deposition took place the day after Procaps filed its motion. [ECF No. 375, p. 3 n. 1]. As to the remaining three depositions, Patheon contends that it never agreed to these depositions, that the parties have never stipulated to more than 10 depositions, that it properly invoked Rule 30(a) 's 10-deposition limit, that Procaps has taken more than 10 depositions and has not justified the need for these additional, over-the-limit depositions. [ Id. at pp. 3-7].
Procaps concedes that it has taken more than 10 depositions, but argues that Patheon's invocation of the 10-deposition limit is without justification and was intended to prevent damage to Patheon's case. [ECF No. 394, p. 2]. Procaps says that the depositions of Bigelow, the ESI Representative, and Lagarde are critical to this case and that it has justified the need for these depositions. [ Id. at pp. 3-5].
With the Court's permission, Patheon filed a sur-reply and Procaps filed a sur-sur-reply. [ECF Nos. 398; 403; 418]. In the supplemental memoranda, the parties trade barbs and accuse each other of misrepresenting the facts relating to the depositions.
B. Applicable Legal Standard 
A party is presumptively limited to 10 depositions but can exceed this limit with the consent of the other party or with leave of court. Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(a)(2) ; Royal Bahamian Ass'n, Inc. v. QBE Ins. Corp., No. 10-21511-CIV, [2010 BL 400162], 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87671 , 2010 WL 3003914 (S.D. Fla. July 29, 2010). A court may grant additional depositions only to the extent that it is consistent with Rule 26(b)(2) . Under Rule 26 , the court must limit discovery if it determines that:
(i) the discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or can be obtained from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive;
(ii) the party seeking discovery has had ample opportunity to obtain the information by discovery in the action; or
(iii) the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs [*5] its likely benefit, considering the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, the parties' resources, the importance of the issues at stake in the action, and the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(2)(C)(i) -(iii) .

The party seeking more than 10 depositions must justify the necessity of each prior deposition taken without leave of court and must make a particularized showing why the extra depositions are necessary. Gordilis v. Ocean Drive Limousines, Inc., No. 12-CV-24358, [2013 BL 398916], 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 173533 , 2013 WL 6383973 , at *1 (S.D. Fla. Dec. 5, 2013) (internal citations omitted). As Judge Rosenbaum cogently pointed out, the reason a party has to justify its prior depositions is because "a party could circumvent the cap on depositions by exhausting the maximum allotted number to take those that she could not justify under Rule 26(b)(2) standards, and then seek[] leave to exceed the limit in order to take depositions that she could substantiate." AIG Centennial Ins. Co. v. O'Neill, No. 09-60551-CIV, [2010 BL 246083], 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114148 , 2010 WL 4116555 , at *16 (S.D. Fla. Oct. 18, 2010) (quoting Barrow v. Greenville Indep. Sch. Dist., 202 F.R.D. 480 , 483 (N.D. Tex. 2001)).
C. Discussion 
Before examining Procaps' requested depositions, the Court makes a few preliminary observations.
First, it is clear that counsel did not initially discuss, or pay much attention to, how many depositions each side would take. Indeed, right up to the discovery deadline Procaps' counsel continued requesting and scheduling depositions as if they were limitless. For its part, Patheon's counsel appears to have been unaware of the deposition limit and initially overlooked Procaps' depositions beyond the 10-deposition limit. Patheon's counsel's invocation of this limit is what caused Procaps to cry foul and to file the instant motion, contending, in part, that Patheon waived the limit.
There is no hard and fast rule as to when a party waives the 10-deposition limit. Rather, whether there is a waiver is a fact-sensitive inquiry. Compare Truong v. Sacramento Cnty. Sheriff Dept., No. 2:10-CV-00506-MCE, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 163689 , 2012 WL 5707228 , at *2 (E.D. Cal. Nov. 15, 2012) (finding no waiver where defendant allegedly stipulated to additional depositions by assisting in scheduling more than 10 depositions but then invoked the rule), with AIG Centennial Ins. Co., [2010 BL 246083], 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114148 , 2010 WL 4116555 , at *17-19 (not counting two depositions toward plaintiff's deposition limit because defendant's counsel repeatedly failed to note any objections in numerous correspondence regarding the scheduling of these over-the-limit depositions).
Second, the parties very much dispute in their papers which depositions count toward the other's 10 deposition limit. As this Court has noted, which depositions count toward the 10 deposition limit is "uncertain terrain." Royal Bahamian Ass'n, Inc., [2010 BL 400162], 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87671 , 2010 WL 3003914 , at *1. And just like in Royal Bahamian, this Court doesn't have to tread that terrain. Id . 2 That's because everyone agrees that Procaps has taken more than 10 depositions.
1. Zamora's Deposition
The issue of Zamora's deposition is moot because Patheon produced Zamora and Procaps took his deposition.
2. Bigelow's Deposition
Bigelow was Patheon's President of North American Operations before and during the Collaboration [*6] Agreement. [ECF No. 394, p. 2]. Despite being able to obtain an affidavit from Bigelow in support of this motion, Procaps also wants to take his deposition. [ Id. at pp. 3-4].
As far back as January 21, 2014, the parties had discussed Bigelow's deposition. [ECF No. 350-2, p. 1]. By January 31, 2014, Bigelow had executed a waiver of service of his deposition subpoena and Patheon's counsel had represented that it was their understanding they would be representing Bigelow at his March 7, 2014 deposition. [ Id. at pp. 2-8; ECF No. 350-3, p. 1].
On February 18, 2014, Procaps' counsel sent another email in which he mentioned Bigelow's March 7 deposition while discussing other deposition dates. [ECF No. 350-5, p. 3]. Patheon's counsel responded and did not mention any objection to Bigelow's deposition based on Rule 30(a) or otherwise. [ Id.]. By Patheon's own count, Procaps had taken more than 10 depositions by February 18, 2014. [ECF No. 375-1, p. 2].
On February 21, 2014, Procaps' counsel noticed the ESI Representative's 30(b)(6) deposition. [ECF No. 350-9, p. 2]. By this date, it was obvious that Procaps had taken more than 10 depositions. [ECF No. 375-1, p. 2]. On February 26, 2014, Patheon's counsel sent an email objecting to this deposition because it exceeded Rule 30(a) 's deposition limit. [ECF No. 350-9, p. 1]. But, in that email, Patheon's counsel did not mention anything about Bigelow's deposition as violating Rule 30(a) . [ Id.]. In fact, Patheon's counsel did not get around to objecting to Bigelow's deposition on this basis until two days later, February 28, 2014. [ECF No. 350-10, p. 1].
As shown above, while Patheon did not expressly stipulate to Bigelow's deposition, it neither expressly nor implicitly objected to his deposition, even when it became clear that Procaps exceeded the 10 deposition limit. Indeed, even after Patheon objected to one deposition based on Rule 30(a) , it failed to object to Bigelow's deposition until two days later. Accordingly, under these circumstances, the Court will grant Procaps' request to depose Bigelow. AIG Centennial Ins. Co., [2010 BL 246083], 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114148 , 2010 WL 4116555 , at *17-19.
3. The ESI Representative's Deposition
On February 18, 2014, the day after Patheon filed its motion for a forensic analysis of Procap's electronic media [ECF No. 300], Procaps' counsel emailed Patheon's counsel with dozens of questions relating to Patheon's discovery procedures in collecting electronically stored information ("ESI"). [ECF No. 350-16]. Three days later, Procaps noticed the ESI Representative's 30(b)(6) deposition. [ECF No. 350-9, p. 2]. Unlike the reaction to Procaps' request for Bigelow's deposition, on February 26, 2014, Patheon's counsel sent an email objecting to this corporate representative deposition because it exceeded Rule 30(a)'s deposition limit. [ Id. at p. 1]. Patheon, however, offered to answer Procaps' email-questions about Patheon's ESI discovery collection if Procaps put those questions in an interrogatory. [ Id.]. Procaps declined to do so.
In seeking to take the ESI Representative's deposition, Procaps says it sent its email on February 18, 2014, because that is when Patheon first produced certain documents from Michael Lytton, a Patheon custodian, which should have been produced [*7] earlier. [ECF No. 350, p. 5]. It also says that this deposition is justified because, among other things, Patheon waived Rule 30(a)'s deposition limit, Patheon's ESI production is deficient, Patheon improperly objected in depositions when Procaps asked about Patheon's ESI collection efforts, and Procaps needs this information to ensure a proportionality of discovery obligations. [ECF Nos. 350, pp. 5-6; 394, pp. 4-5; 418, pp. 3-4].
In response, Patheon points out that Procaps never justified its prior depositions as it is required to do. Patheon also contested all of Procaps' purported justifications for this deposition and attached an affidavit from its counsel detailing Patheon's ESI collection efforts. [See ECF Nos. 375; 375-12; 398-1].
Unlike with the Bigelow deposition arrangements and discussion, Patheon timely raised its Rule 30(a) objection and never agreed, implicitly or expressly, to this deposition. Accordingly, the Court finds that Patheon did not waive its Rule 30(a) deposition limit objection as it relates to this deposition. Truong, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 163689 , 2012 WL 5707228 , at *2. Thus, because there was no waiver, Procaps must justify its prior depositions and justify taking this deposition. In that regard, despite filing a motion, reply, and a sur-sur-reply, Procaps has not made a sufficient attempt to justify its prior depositions. As a result, the Court denies Procaps' request to take this deposition. Barrow, 202 F.R.D. at 484 .
The Court also notes that Procaps' justifications for the deposition are unpersuasive and contradicted by the record. Despite this litigation being hotly contested and Patheon asking Procaps deponents about ESI collection in November 2013 [ECF Nos. 227; 227-1], Procaps began to focus on Patheon's ESI collection efforts only after Patheon discovered that Procaps failed to implement a litigation hold and allowed its employees to self-collect ESI. [ECF No. 300]. The reason for this late and sudden interest in Patheon's ESI collection efforts is obvious: Procaps wants to change the analysis of its ESI failures to an evaluation of Patheon's purported ESI failures. In other words, Procaps is using the sports strategy of "the best defense is a good offense." To its credit, Patheon has not yet shied away from Procaps' questions, and it produced a comprehensive and detailed affidavit outlining its ESI collection. The affidavit should answer most of Procaps' questions.
Although the Court is denying Procaps' request for a deposition, it will allow Procaps to pose the questions from its February 18, 2014 email in an interrogatory to Patheon. If Procaps chooses to do so, then it shall send the interrogatory to Patheon by April 1, 2014. Patheon shall respond to the interrogatory by April 8, 2014. If, after receiving Patheon's interrogatory answers, Procaps still contests the sufficiency of Patheon's ESI collection, then Procaps' counsel may file an appropriate motion to compel better interrogatory answers. The Court will not, however, permit Procaps' requested 30(b)(6) deposition on ESI collection sufficiency.
4. Lagarde's Deposition
Lagarde is the managing director of JLL Partners ("[*8] JLL"), the majority shareholder of Patheon. Procaps says that his testimony is critical for two reasons. First, Procaps contends that it just learned on March 11, 2014, that Patheon and JLL have merged with Royal DSM — another Procaps competitor — and that Patheon may no longer exist. Second, Procaps argues that Daniel Argoskin ("Argoskin"), JLL's 30(b)(6) representative, knew nothing about Patheon's day-to-day operations and thus it needs to depose Lagarde. [ECF No. 350, p. 6; 394, p. 5].
Patheon contends that Procaps knew of Patheon and JLL's merger plans with Royal DSM since November 2013. [ECF No. 398-1, p. 5]. Patheon also points out that Procaps was not satisfied with Argoskin's preparation for his 30(b)(6) deposition and moved to compel JLL to produce an adequately prepared 30(b)(6) representative in the Southern District of New York ("SDNY"). The SDNY court denied Procaps' request. Thus, Patheon argues that Procaps' request to depose Lagarde is an end-run around the SDNY court order.
As was the case with Procaps' request for an ESI Representative deposition, the Court finds that Patheon did not waive its Rule 30(a) deposition limit objection as it relates to this deposition and that Procaps has not justified its prior depositions. As a result, the Court denies Procaps' request for this deposition. Barrow, 202 F.R.D. at 484 .
As an alternative ground, the Court also denies Procaps' request because it has not shown a justification or need for this deposition. First, Procaps knew of the merger plans in November 26, 2013, when it deposed Glass [ECF No. 398-1, p. 39], but failed to timely act on this information. Second, Procaps wants Lagarde's deposition because, as it says, Argoskin did not know anything about Patheon's day-to-day operations. In other words, Procaps is not satisfied with Argoskin's deposition answers. But a SDNY court has found that Argoskin's deposition answers satisfied Rule 30(b)(6)'s requirements. [ECF No. 366-1]. While Procaps may disagree with that ruling, this Court is not the appropriate forum to reconsider that ruling.
D. Conclusion 
As set forth above, the Court denies in part and grants in part Procaps' motion. Consequently, the Court finds that neither Patheon nor Procaps is a prevailing party under Rule 37 for purposes of a fees award. Therefore, the Court declines to enter an award of attorney's fees on this motion.
III. Conclusion 
One final point: the level of acrimony, ill will, and personal attacks between counsel appears to be increasing yet again. [ECF No. 230, p. 2]. As the Court noted, it will continue to ignore these personal attacks when substantively reviewing the parties' filings. [ Id. at pp. 1-2]. Thus, these personal attacks, whether in emails attached as exhibits or in other court filings, serve no purpose in advancing each party's arguments but only serve to increase counsel's stress, tension, and anxiety. The Court will rule on motions based on the facts and the law. Tossing in emotional rhetoric and branding opposing counsel with offensive insults detracts from the legal arguments.3 
Practicing law is stressful. Being a litigation lawyer is particularly stressful. Litigating [*9] a huge-dollar antitrust case with complex issues is even more stressful. This stress is compounded when the attorneys are personally attacking each other. Counsel may want to respond in kind when attacked, but, in the words of Mahatma Gandhi, "an eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind." For their own emotional wellbeing, counsel are encouraged to avoid the rhetorical blitzkriegs and verbal muggings. And for the Court's benefit, the attorneys are now specifically directed to refrain from using motions and memoranda as a means to launch personal assaults against opposing counsel. If counsel cannot constrain themselves and continue to engage in verbal volleys and insult-riddled barrages, then the Court will take action.

Contrary to the parties' assertions, in Royal Bahamian this Court did not decide the issues they say it did, i.e., whether expert depositions count toward the limit and whether a 30(b)(6) deponent who appears in his/her individual and corporate capacities counts as one deposition or two depositions. The Court expressly did not decide the former and noted that regardless of how it treated the latter (one or two) it would not affect its decision in that case.

WILLIAM C. TURNOFF 
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
THIS CAUSE is before the Court upon Defendant Eisai Inc.'s Motion to Tax Costs Against Relator Michael Keeler, and Bill of Costs (ECF No. 237), and Defendant Eisai Inc.'s Motion for Entitlement to Attorneys Fees and Costs (ECF No. 255). These motions were referred to the undersigned by the Honorable Kathleen M. Williams, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Florida. (ECF No. 242). A hearing on these motions took place before the undersigned on October 23, 2014. (ECF No. 286). The Court has considered the written and oral arguments, the record, the applicable law, and is otherwise duly advised in the premises.
Factual and Procedural Background 
The Relator, Michael Keeler, filed this qui tam action against Defendant Eisai, Inc., claiming to have specific inside information establishing that Eisai violated the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3729 , et seq. ("FCA"), in the marketing of four of its drugs.1 The Relator alleged that he had substantial inside knowledge of these schemes from having been employed by Eisai as a pharmaceutical sales representative from 2006 through [*2] mid-2009.
The Relator sued under three different FCA liability provisions: 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729(a)(1) , (a)(2) , & (a)(3) :2 Subsection (a)(1) prohibits presentation, or the causing of presentation, of false or fraudulent claims to the government; Subsection (a)(2) prohibits use of a false or fraudulent statement or record to get the government to pay a claim; and Subsection (a)(3) prohibits a person from conspiring to get a false or fraudulent claim allowed or paid by the government. The Complaint alleged that Eisai engaged in three complex, nationwide schemes: (1) illegally failing to provide the government with the requisite "best price" for the drugs Aloxi, Fragmin, Ontak, and Dacogen; (2) off-label marketing of Ontak and Dacogen in violation of FDA laws; and (3) providing illicit kickbacks to health care providers to induce them to buy the subject drugs instead of competitors' FDA-approved drugs. The Relator noted that the off-label marketing and kickback schemes did not involve allegations that Eisai itself submitted false claims to the government; rather, it was the health care providers (e.g., doctors, hospitals, pharmacies) who submitted claims for reimbursement to Medicare and Medicaid. As such, this was a "cause to be submitted" case in which it was alleged that Eisai had caused providers to present claims for improper Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, stemming from Eisai's schemes.
Eisai contended that its off-label marketing was legal because doctors may prescribe a drug to a patient provided that they use sound judgment, and the drug was FDA-approved for some indication, not necessarily the FDA-approved indication. The Relator argued that Eisai ignored the fact that federal law unequivocally prohibited pharmaceutical companies from off-label marketing, which is distinct from off-label use by a physician. The former was strictly prohibited by Congress, while the latter was not.
The Relator filed suit under seal on August 4, 2009. (ECF No. 1). A First Amended Complaint was filed on July 8, 2010. (ECF No. 19). On February 24, 2011, the United States declined to intervene. (ECF No. 23). Judge Ungaro dismissed the First Amended Complaint on June 21, 2011, with leave to file an amended complaint. (ECF No. 61).
The Relator filed a Second Amended Complaint on July 1, 2011. (ECF No. 62). Defendant moved to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint. (ECF No. 76). Judge Ungaro deemed moot the motion to dismiss upon the filing of the Third Amended Complaint, which was the operative pleading.3 (ECF No. 80, 81). Eisai moved to dismiss the Third Amended Complaint on the same grounds as before. (ECF No. 95). On January 31, 2013, Judge Williams entered an Order dismissing the action with prejudice. (ECF No. 232).4 She found that the Relator had the chance to litigate his assertions of fraud but had been unable to posit a sufficient link between Eisai, doctors, and government programs to sustain a claim.
On February 28, 2013, the Relator filed a Motion to Amend Order of Dismissal Under Rules 60(a) and (b) , and Rule 59(e) , and for Leave of Court to File a Fourth Amended Complaint. (ECF No. 236). On April 1, 2013, Judge Williams entered an Order denying [*3] Relator's motion to amend, which she treated as a motion for reconsideration. (ECF No. 257).
On February 26, 2013, Eisai filed a Motion to Bifurcate the Issue of Entitlement to Attorney's Fees and Costs From Amount. (ECF No. 233). On March 1, 2013, Defendant filed a Motion to Tax Costs. (ECF No. 237). That same day, Relator filed a Notice of Appeal of Judge Williams' dismissal order to the Eleventh Circuit. (ECF No. 238). The costs motion and the motion to bifurcate were referred to the undersigned. (ECF No. 235, 242). After holding a status conference on March 28, 2013 (ECF No. 243), the undersigned stayed consideration of the motion to bifurcate, the cost motion, and the motion to exceed page limits pending appeal, and allowed Eisai to file its fee motion, but Relator was not obligated to respond yet. That same day, Eisai filed a Motion for Entitlement to Attorney's Fees and Costs. (ECF No. 255). These rulings were memorialized via Omnibus Order dated April 8, 2013. (ECF No. 261).
On July 25, 2014, the appellate court issued its mandate affirming dismissal of the case. (ECF No. 276). Judge Williams entered an Order lifting the stay on August 13, 2014. (ECF No. 277). On September 25, 2014, the undersigned entered an Omnibus Order granting the motion to bifurcate entitlement to fees from amount of award; granting in part the Relator's motion to exceed page limits; providing a briefing schedule; and setting a hearing for October 23, 2014. (ECF No. 278). The order provided that no further filings would be permitted, unless requested by the court. In this connection, the Court denied Eisai's motion for leave to file a reply. (ECF No. 285).
In the instant motions, Eisai contended that it was entitled to attorney's fees and costs under the FCA ( 31 U.S.C. § 3730(d)(4) ), 28 U.S.C. § 1927 , and this Court's inherent powers. Relator denied that Eisai was entitled to any award of attorney's fees or costs.
I. Defendant Eisai Inc.'s Motion to Tax Costs Against Relator Michael Keeler, and Bill of Costs. (ECF No. 237).
A. Costs sought by Eisai.
Eisai, as the prevailing party by virtue of the Court's Order granting its motion to dismiss, sought to recover costs in the amount of $607,625.04,5 pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d) and Local Rule 7.3 . (ECF No. 232). The costs are as follows: (a) $7,347.40 in fees for printed or electronically recorded transcripts, consisting of $433.80 in transcript costs, and $6,913.60 in deposition costs; (b) $23,885.75 in printing and copying costs, consisting of $705.80 in color imaging/copying, and $23,179.95 in printing/duplicating; (c) $576,391.89 in electronic discovery costs, consisting of $335,921.55 in technical services, which includes $324,641.68 in collection and processing, $238,524.34 in hosting costs, and $13,225.87 in professional fees.
At the hearing, Relator conceded that the following costs were taxable: (1) $433.80 in transcript costs; (2) $6,913.60 in depositions costs; (3) $20,723 in collection and processing costs spanning from February 13, 2012, through April 16, 2012; and (4) $1,946 in hard drive costs, which were included in costs for professional fees. Notwithstanding, Relator argued that no costs should be taxed in this case.
B. Standard for cost recovery.
Pursuant to Rule 54(d)(1) , "costs other than attorney'[*4] s fees shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs." Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d)(1) . Thus, Eisai, as the prevailing party, is presumptively entitled to recover costs. However, Eisai must show that the claimed costs are authorized by § 1920 , and that they were reasonably or necessarily incurred for use in the case. Univ. of Miami v. Intuitive Surgical. Inc., No. 04-20409-CIV, [2007 BL 110558], 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18836 , 2007 WL 781912 , at *1 (S.D. Fla. Mar. 13, 2007). To meet this burden, Eisai must provide sufficient detail and documentation regarding those costs in order to permit challenges by opposing counsel and meaningful review by the Court. Lee v. American Eagle Airlines. Inc., 93 F.Supp.2d 1322 , 1335 (S.D. Fla. 2000) (finding that the movant "bears the burden of submitting a request for expenses that would enable the Court to determine what expenses were incurred and whether Plaintiff is entitled to them.").
Relator argued that the FCA imposed a higher standard for a cost award that Eisai did not meet. Pursuant to the FCA,
If the Government does not proceed with the action and the person bringing the action conducts the action, the court may award to the defendant its reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses if the defendant prevails in the action and the court finds that the claim of the person bringing the action was clearly frivolous, clearly vexatious, or brought primarily for purposes of harassment.
31 U.S.C. § 3730(d)(4) . Thus, Relator argued that costs may not be taxed against it as a losing FCA plaintiff, unless the claims were found to be frivolous. The undersigned finds this argument to be unpersuasive. In U.S. v. Degayner, the court found that the fees and expenses provision of the FCA did not displace its authority to award costs to the prevailing party pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d) . U.S. v. DeGayner, No. 6:06-cv-1462-Orl-19KRS, [2009 BL 7371], 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5658 , 2009 WL 111673 , at *3 (M.D. Fla. Jan. 1, 2009) (collecting cases). The Relator has not provided any authority to the contrary. Accordingly, Eisai is entitled to recover its costs as the prevailing party under Rule 54 .

C. Relator's arguments against an award of costs.
Rule 54 creates a strong presumption that the court will award costs to the prevailing party. Mathews v. Crosby, 480 F.3d 1265 , 1276 (11th Cir. 2007) (noting that "there is a strong presumption that the prevailing party will be awarded costs."); Manor Healthcare Corp. v. Lomelo, 929 F.2d 633 , 639 (11th Cir. 1991) (noting that Rule 54(d) "creates a presumption in favor of awarding costs to the prevailing party which [the opponent] must overcome."). Notwithstanding, Relator argued that the court should deny all of Eisai's costs. "[S]ince denial of costs is in the nature of a penalty for some defection on [the prevailing party's] part in the course of the litigation," Walters v. Roadway Express. Inc., 557 F.2d 521 , 526 (5th Cir. 1977) (internal marks and citation omitted), the district court's discretion not to award the full amount of costs incurred by the prevailing party is not unlimited. See Head v. Medford, 62 F.3d 351 , 354 (11th Cir. 1995). "To defeat the presumption and deny full costs, a district court must have and state a sound basis for doing so." Chapman v. AI Transp., 229 F.3d 1012 , 1039 (11th Cir. 2000).
By way of summary, Relator attacked the sufficiency of the cost motion and the supporting documentation, argued that electronic [*5] discovery and copying costs were not recoverable, and pointed to Eisai's own conduct and Relator's financial condition, in support of its position that no costs should be awarded in this case.
1. Sufficiency of the cost motion.
Relator argued that Eisai failed to meet its burden of proving that the requested costs were both reasonable and necessary under Rule 54(d) and § 1920 , because the itemization of costs was heavily redacted and lacked sufficient detail. The court's review of the exhibits attached to the cost motion and the reply confirm that many of the invoices have been heavily redacted and lack in specificity with respect to the services actually performed. Moreover, the Itemization of Costs provides scant, general information regarding the requested costs. Upon review, the undersigned finds that, generally, the invoices are lacking in specificity regarding what services were actually performed. In this connection, Relator argued that the KPMG affidavit (ECF No. 254-2) provided insufficient information to support the "Professional Fees" listed in Section II of the Bill of Costs. Also, the KPMG invoices listed charges for "Collection and Processing" and "Fees and Expenses," without further explanation. Relator argued that it was impossible to discern, from the descriptions given, which of these costs, if any, related to "exemplification" or "making copies" of electronic discovery. As noted, the undersigned agrees.
2. Electronic discovery.
Although trial courts are afforded wide latitude in ascertaining taxable costs, absent explicit statutory authorization or contractual authorization, federal courts are limited to those costs specifically enumerated in 28 U.S.C. § 1920 .6 EEOC v. W&O, Inc., 213 F.3d 600 , 620 (11th Cir. 2000) (citing Crawford Fitting Co. v. J.T. Gibbons. Inc., 482 U.S. 437 , 445 , 107 S.Ct. 2494 , 96 L.Ed.2d 385 (1987)).
In dispute is whether electronic discovery costs requested by Eisai in the amount of $576,391.89 are recoverable under § 1920 . The electronic discovery costs fall into three categories: (1) collection and processing; (2) hosting; and (3) professional fees. As noted, Relator conceded that, out of the collection and processing costs, $20,723 were taxable for the period from February through April 2012.
Relying upon Race Tires America, Inc. v. Hoosier Racing Tire Corp., 674 F.3d 158 (3d Cir. 2012), Relator argued that, as a matter of statutory construction, none of these categories constituted either "exemplification" or the "making of copies," pursuant to § 1920(4) . Eisai contended that Congress amended § 1920(4) to include all electronic discovery costs. Relator argued that many courts, including Race Tires, Country Vintner of North Carolina, LLC v. E. & J. Gallo Winery. Inc., 718 F.3d 249 , 260 (4th Cir. 2013), and Finnerty v. Stiefel Laboratories. Inc., 900 F.Supp.2d 1317 , 1322 (S.D. Fla. 2012), have rejected that argument concluding that the amended statute, though broader, did not permit the taxation of all electronic discovery costs.
In Race Tires, the Third Circuit found that decisions allowing the taxation of essentially all electronic discovery consultant charges, such as CBT Flint Partners. LLC v. Return Path. Inc., 737 F.3d 1320 (Fed. Cir. 2013), were "untethered from the statutory [*6] mooring." 674 F.3d at 169 . The appellate court went on to note that § 1920(4) did not state that all steps leading up to the production of copies of materials was taxable and did not authorize taxation merely because present-day technology required technical expertise not ordinarily possessed by the typical legal professional. Id . The Third Circuit persuasively reasoned that "only the conversion of native files to TIFF7 (the agreed-upon default format for production of electronic discovery), and the scanning of documents to create digital duplicates are generally recognized as the taxable 'making copies of material.'" Race Tires, 674 F.3d at 167 .
Eisai argued that Race Tires has not been adopted by the Eleventh Circuit, which has yet to rule on the issue of which electronic discovery costs are taxable. Although the Eleventh Circuit has not adopted Race Tires, the undersigned finds the Third Circuit's reasoning persuasive. As the Country Vintner court noted, the Third Circuit, in reaching its decision, considered the statutory history, the plain language of the statute, and the Supreme Court's narrow interpretation of taxable costs under § 1920 . 718 F.3d at 260 .
Indeed, in Finnerty, this Court noted that, although it was generally agreed that electronic discovery costs were available under § 1920 , there was scant legal authority providing guidance regarding whether they were recoverable under Rule 54(d)(1) and § 1920 . 900 F.Supp.2d at 1320 (citations omitted). The court went on to deny costs for the creation of an electronic database finding that it had been created for the convenience of the party seeking to tax the cost.  Id. at 1322-23 . The court also relied upon Race Tires to find that a holding to the contrary would be beyond the statutory confines and would muddy the distinction between costs and attorney's fees.  Id. at 1322 .
Relator argued that charges for collection and processing of electronic discovery, which included charges for gathering, preserving, processing, loading, post-processing, searching, culling, extracting electronic discovery, copying data from one database to another (from Nuix, an Early Case Assessment tool used for Eisai's convenience, to Relativity, a review platform), converting files from native format to TIFF, and configuring databases, were not taxable under § 1920(4) , pursuant to Race Tires and Finnerty, because they constituted services leading up to the actual making of copies for production. With respect to the TIFF conversion, according to Relator, Eisai rejected an electronic discovery protocol to produce files in native format that would have kept electronic discovery costs down. As such, Relator argued that it should not have to bear the cost of such conversion when it did not request same.
Relator argued that costs totaling $13,225.87, from November 2011 through April 2012, listed in Section II of the Bill of Costs should be denied because the affidavit from outside vendor KPMG (ECF No. 254-2), provided insufficient information regarding Eisai's cost of copying the produced files onto hard drives to support these "Professional Fees." No information [*7] was provided regarding the nature of the work performed, or whether any portion of these "Professional Fees" were for the "exemplification" or "making copies" of electronic discovery. Moreover, KPMG's invoices listed charges for "Collection and Processing" and "Fees and Expenses." The declaration of Brett Trizzino, director of forensic technology services for KPMG, stated that charges for copying data and for narrowing the universe of documents based upon search terms and date restrictions were included in the "Fees and Expenses" section of the invoices ($9,904), and that KPMG configured a database to extract duplicates billed under Processing/Loading ($312,344). Not only were these costs inadequately described, but they are not recoverable under § 1920 .
With respect to the outside vendor DTI, the declaration of Shawna Hull, business manager for DTI, stated that $7,394.95 represented charges for copying electronic data from Eisai's Lotus Notes email files and loading that data into the NUIX database, at a rate of $100 per gigabyte. (ECF No. 254-3). The rest of the charges were for loading data into Relativity, a review platform, applying search terms, and removing duplicate documents. None of these charges constituted making copies under § 1920 . Moreover, these charges were incurred for the convenience of the attorneys.
Next, Eisai requested $238,524.34 in charges incurred for hosting a data set of electronic discovery invoiced by KPMG, which Relator argued were not taxable under § 1920(4) , because they preceded copying done for production, or were for the hosting of a litigation database maintained purely for the party's convenience and use. See CBT Flint Partners, 737 F.3d at 1331 ("The costs of those activities are not the costs of making copies. Rather, they are part of the large body of discovery obligations, mostly related to the document-review process, that Congress has not included in section 1920(4) ."); Finnerty, 900 F.Supp.2d at 1320-21 ("When an electronic database has been built for the purpose of responding to discovery requests, some courts have deemed that a taxable cost. However, many more courts have denied such recovery."). Even if such charges were taxable, Relator argued that they were incurred after Eisai had completed its production to Relator's counsel on March 7, 2012. In this connection, on August 1, 2011, Judge Ungaro summarily denied Eisai's Motion to Stay Discovery. However, Eisai objected to every request for production. See (ECF No. 139, 159, 167). On December 15, 2011, the undersigned found that all of Relator's Requests for Production were reasonable and that Eisai had essentially imposed its own stay of discovery, thus leaving Relator "bereft in the desert of non-discovery." (ECF No. 224). The court ordered Eisai to produce documents within two months, i.e., by late February 2012. As such, Relator argued that any electronic discovery costs incurred prior to December 2011, and after February 2012 (i.e., invoices from April, 2012, through January, 2013), could only have been incurred for Eisai's own convenience and were not recoverable. The claimed electronic discovery costs [*8] from December 2011, through February 2012—the discovery period—totaled $221,071. Nevertheless, Relator argued that these costs should also be denied because of Eisai's unnecessary TIFF conversion, double-loading onto review platforms, and the unreasonable rates approved by Eisai.
Relator argued that, under Race Tires, Eisai could only recover the cost of copying the produced electronic discovery onto media, which entailed converting native digital files into other formats for production and scanning hard copies to create digital duplicates for discovery production. Race Tires, 674 F.3d at 167 ("[O]nly the conversion of native files to TIFF (the agreed-upon default format for production of [electronic discovery]), and the scanning of documents to create digital duplicates are generally recognized as the taxable 'making copies of material.'"); El Camino Resources, Ltd. v. Huntington National Bank, No. 1:07-cv-598, [2012 BL 441105], 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 146037 , 2012 WL 4808741 , at *7 (W.D. Mich. May 3, 2012) ("Under the Race Tires America approach, the only compensable costs are (a) the conversion of native digital files to the agreed-upon production format and (b) the scanning of paper documents to create digital duplicates for production in discovery."). At any rate, the costs of file scanning and file format conversion were only taxable to the extent that they were designated on the Bill of Costs as having been incurred for these purposes. According to Relator, the only costs associated therewith that were adequately described were those described as purchasing hard drives totaling $1,946. Thus, the undersigned finds that Eisai may recover this cost in the amount of $1,946.
3. Copying/Printing costs.
Eisai sought $23,885.75 in copying and printing costs. Relator argued that printing costs were not recoverable under § 1920 and that neither the Motion nor the Bill of Costs provided any information about the need for the photocopies or printing charges. See Degayner, [2009 BL 7371], 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5658 , 2009 WL 111673 , at *4. Relator argued that this claim was suspect because Eisai produced records electronically, not as hard copies. Further, Relator argued that the claim was not adequately itemized, as Eisai failed to provide a rate per page, the number of copies, or a breakdown of why each category of copies was needed. Cullens v. Ga. Dep't of Transp., 29 F.3d 1489 , 1494 (11th Cir. 1994); Osorio v. One World Technologies, Inc., 834 F.Supp.2d 20 (D. Mass. 2011).
In reply, Eisai provided a breakdown of the number of copies and the rates charged by the outside vendors, which ranged from $0.10 to $0.30 per page. In this respect, Relator argued that a rate of $0.10 was reasonable, and that Eisai failed to show that the copies were provided to the Court or Relator. See Grady v. Bunzi Packaging Supply Co., 161 F.R.D. 477 (N.D. Ga. 1995); Duckworth v. Whisenant, 97 F.3d 1393 , 1399 (11th Cir. 1996) (general copying not recoverable under § 1920 ). In any event, $0.10, not even $0.20 per copy, is reasonable); Santana v. RCSH Op'ns, No. 10-61376-CIV, [2012 BL 237857], 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124119 , 2012 WL 3779013 , at * 8 (S.D. Fla. Aug. 31, 2012). Eisai argued that the majority of the copy/printing charges were for discovery, research, pleadings, motions, memoranda, depositions and exhibits. Eisai's counsel copied/printed 91,244 pages at .20 per page ($18,248.80); Squire Sanders made black and [*9] white copies of 8,035 pages at .30 per page ($2,410.50); King & Spaulding made black and white copies of 35,581 pages at .10 per page ($3,558.10); and outside vendor charges for copies were $10,552.56. Acknowledging that some of the charges may not be reimbursable, Eisai reduced its requested copy costs to $23,179.95, or two-thirds of the total amount requested for black and white copying and outside vendor charges.
It is well-established that the movant must provide information regarding the purpose of the copies and whether they related to the claims at issue. See Helms v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 808 F. Supp. 1568 , 1570 (N.D. Ga. 1992), aff'd, 998 F.2d 1023 (11th Cir.1993); see also Lee, 93 F.Supp.2d at 1335-36 (declining to tax photocopy costs lacking description). Here, Eisai failed to indicate whether all of the requested copies were necessary, as opposed to convenient, particularly in light of the fact that most discovery was provided electronically. It also failed to explain the differing rates among the outside vendors for black and white copies. The copy information provided was insufficient to meet the burden of showing that all of the copies were necessarily obtained for use in the case. However, the court is aware that, undoubtedly, some of the copies were made for use in the case. As such, the undersigned finds that a substantial reduction is in order, as follows: Eisai may recover 10% of the total 134,860 copies requested, or 13,486 copies, at a rate of $0.10 per page, for a total of $1,348.60 in copy costs.
D. Recoverable Costs 
Eisai sought to recover $7,347.40 in fees for printed or electronically recorded transcripts consisting of $433.80 in transcript costs, and $6,913.60 in deposition costs. These costs are recoverable under § 1920(2) , as Relator conceded.
Eisai sought to recover $23,885.75 in printing and copying costs, consisting of $705.80 in color imaging/copying, and $23,179.95 in printing/duplicating. As noted herein, Eisai may only recover $1,348.60 in copying costs.
Finally, Eisai sought to recover $576,391.89 in electronic discovery costs, the majority of which are not recoverable under § 1920 .8 As noted herein, Relator conceded that $20,723 out of the collection and processing costs were taxable, spanning from February 13, 2012, through April 16, 2012. The hosting costs of $238,524.34 are not taxable. Out of the professional fees costs of $13,225.87, Eisai may only recover $1,946 in hard drive costs.
In summary, the undersigned finds that only the following costs requested by Eisai are taxable under § 1920: (1) Transcript costs of $433.80; (2) Deposition costs of $6,913.60; (3) Hard drive expenses of $1,946; (4) $1,348.60 in copy costs; and (5) $20,723 in electronic discovery costs. Thus, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Eisai be awarded total costs in the amount of $31,365.00.
1. Chilling effect and Unclean Hands.
In his initial 30-page preliminary opposition memorandum, the Relator argued that costs should be denied for the following reasons: Eisai had unclean hands because the evidence in Relator's sealed motion for partial summary judgment showed that Eisai knowingly provided the Ontak Access Resource ("OAR") Program kickbacks and illegally off-label marketed [*10] Ontak; after stonewalling discovery for months, Eisai refused to enter into an electronic discovery protocol and unilaterally converted electronic discovery from native format to TIFF; and a cost award would have a chilling effect on whistleblowers.9 In the 5-page supplementary memorandum, Relator explained that he and his counsel had "lost their shirts" when Eisai prevailed on the pleadings and that a cost award in the amount sought would devastate Relator and his family. (ECF No. 279).
With respect to unclean hands, although Eisai succeeded in obtaining a dismissal with prejudice of Relator's Third Amended Complaint, Relator argued that it had produced evidence in discovery that corroborated his allegations regarding kickbacks related to Ontak and the OAR Program and the off-label marketing of Ontak. Relator argued that this evidence was a defense to the taxation of costs. However, the Court never addressed the alleged evidence substantively. In fact, Judge Williams noted that it was not known whether Relator's allegations were actually true. (ECF No. 232) at p. 37. As such, the undersigned declines to deny costs on this basis.
With respect to Relator's argument that a cost award would have a chilling effect on other qui tam plaintiffs, Relator has not shown why a potential chilling effect should overcome the presumption of a cost award to the prevailing party. See Chapman, 229 F.3d at 1039 (citing Durrett v. Jenkins Brickyard, Inc., 678 F.2d 911 , 917 (11th Cir. 1982) (finding that, in a Title VII Case, "[a] fee must be assessed [against non-prevailing plaintiffs] which will serve the deterrent purpose of the statute, and no fee will provide no deterrence")); See Degayner, [2009 BL 7371], 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5658 , 2009 WL 111673 , at * 3, FN 2 ("[Relator] has failed to show why the potential danger of chilling future FCA claims—standing alone as a mere assertion with no support from "a federal statute, [the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure], or a court order," Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d)(1) —should overcome the traditional presumption that a district court will award costs to a prevailing party.").
Finally, "the Court acknowledges that the good faith of unsuccessful litigants is a relevant consideration in Rule 54(d) deliberations. Good faith, without more, however, is an insufficient basis for denying costs to a prevailing party." Friends of Everglades v. S. Fla. Water Mgmt. Dist., 865 F.Supp.2d 1159 , 1168 (S.D. Fla. 2011) (quoting White & White Inc. v. Am. Hosp. Supply Corp., 786 F.2d 728 , 731 (6th Cir. 1986) (internal quotation marks omitted)); see also Pickett v. Iowa Beef Processors, 149 F. App'x 831 , 832 (11th Cir. 2005).
2. Financial Circumstances.
Relator argued that the court should take his financial status into account in calculating the amount of costs that he was required to pay. In Chapman v. AI Transp., the Eleventh Circuit held that "a non-prevailing party's financial status is a factor that a district court may, but need not, consider in its award of costs pursuant to Rule 54(d) ." 229 F.3d at 1039 . Should the court choose to consider the non-prevailing party's financial status, "substantial documentation of a true inability to pay" must be produced. Id . Thus, a non-prevailing party must provide "clear proof of [his] dire financial circumstances" to justify a decrease in costs. [*11] Id . The court has discretion to determine whether the financial circumstances provide clear proof. Id . However, the court may not take into account "the relative wealth of the parties." Id . The Chapman court went on to note that, "[e]ven in those rare circumstances where the non-prevailing party's financial circumstances are considered in determining the amount of costs to be awarded, a court may not decline to award any costs at all." Id . 
Here, Relator requested additional time to produce pertinent financial documentation regarding his financial circumstances and resulting inability to pay a cost award. The Court has awarded costs to Eisai as the prevailing party. Therefore, Relator may file substantial documentation of his inability to pay within five (5) days.
II. Defendant Eisai Inc.'s Motion for Entitlement to Attorneys Fees and Costs. (ECF No. 255).
Eisai claimed that it was entitled to attorney's fees and costs pursuant to the FCA, § 1927 , and the Court's inherent power.
A. Fees under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. § 3730(d)(4) .
The FCA permits a prevailing Defendant in a qui tam action to recover attorney's fees and expenses under certain circumstances:
If the Government does not proceed with the action and the person bringing the action conducts the action, the court may award to the defendant its reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses if the defendant prevails in the action and the court finds that the claim of the person bringing the action was clearly frivolous, clearly vexatious, or brought primarily for purposes of harassment.
31 U.S.C. § 3730(d)(4) . Thus, to award attorney's fees and expenses, the Court must find that the Relator's suit falls within one of the following categories: (1) clearly frivolous; (2) clearly vexatious; or (3) brought primarily for purposes of harassment. Any one of these three conditions is sufficient for an award of attorney's fees. However, even if a plaintiff's suit falls within one of the enumerated categories, a court still maintains discretion over whether to award attorney's fees. See § 3730(d)(4) (stating "the court may award ... attorneys' fees") (emphasis added); United States ex rel. Dodge v. ACS State & Local Solutions, Inc., No. 8:03-cv-65-T-30TGW, 2009 WL 1748540 , at *1 (M.D. Fla. June 18, 2009). Imposition of fees pursuant to § 3730(d)(4) requires a showing that the relator was motivated "primarily" by an improper purpose. U.S. ex rel. Bane v. Breathe Easy Pulmonary Services, Inc., No. 8:06-cv-40-T-33MAP, [2009 BL 91256], 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35771 , 2009 WL 1148632 , at *4 (M.D. Fla. Apr. 28, 2009). Indeed, "an award of fees [under § 3730(d)(4) ] should be reserved for rare and special circumstances." Id . 

1. Clearly frivolous.
The Eleventh Circuit has outlined three factors for district courts to consider when deciding frivolity: (1) whether the plaintiff established a prima facie case; (2) whether the defendant offered to settle; and (3) whether the trial court dismissed the case prior to trial or held a full-blown trial on the merits. Head, 62 F.3d at 356 . Eisai argued that (1) Relator's complaint was dismissed more than once, such that Relator never established a prima facie case; (2) Eisai never offered any money to settle this case and opposed going to court-imposed mediation while the motion to dismiss [*12] was pending; and (3) the Court dismissed the case with prejudice before a trial on the merits. However, "determinations regarding frivolity are to be made on a case-by-case basis." Sullivan v. School Bd., 713 F.2d 1182 (5th Cir. 1983).
Eisai argued that Relator's Second and Third Amended Complaints were frivolous, because Relator filed them knowing that he lacked the factual basis required by Judge Ungaro's June 2011 Order and the case law, because he did not have personal knowledge of a false claim having been submitted to the government as a result of any action by Eisai. In this regard, Eisai argued that the law in the Eleventh Circuit was well-established with respect to the pleading requirements under the FCA. Eisai further argued that Relator's counsel were experienced in qui tam actions, such that they should have been familiar with the pleading requirements for asserting a false claims violation. Moreover, the June 2011 Order dismissing the First Amended Complaint put Relator on notice of the deficiencies in his complaint. Relator was told that he needed to specify in his amended complaint the "who, what, where, and when" of the alleged fraud in order to state a cause of action under the FCA. Instead of pleading same, Relator argued that the court should apply a relaxed standard. However, Judge Ungaro found that, even under the relaxed standard, the "who," "when," and "how" must be plead. Relator argued that he reasonably advocated a more relaxed standard based upon both Eleventh Circuit precedent holding that Rule 9(b) may be satisfied where there is some indicia of reliability that false claims were submitted, and that Rule 9(b) may be relaxed where the relator was an insider, the scheme was nationwide, or the details of the fraud were mostly within the defendant's knowledge. Relator argued in good faith that he satisfied all of these grounds. According to Relator, he took the same position that the Justice Department and the Solicitor General have taken in other FCA cases.
In U.S. ex rel. Cullins v. Astra, Inc., No. 09-60696-CIV, [2010 BL 173523], 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87669 , 2010 WL 3008833 , at *3 (S.D. Fla. Jul. 28, 2010), this Court relied upon United States ex rel. Gross v. AIDS Research Alliance-Chicago, No. 01-C-8182, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7302 , 2004 WL 905952 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 27, 2004), to find that the plaintiff's claims were not clearly frivolous where the court had granted leave to file an amended complaint. The court in Gross granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the plaintiff's second amended complaint with prejudice for failing to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7302 , 2004 WL 905952 at *9. However, the court did not grant attorney's fees under § 3730 , because it did not find the plaintiff's suit to be vexatious or frivolous. 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7302 [ WL] at *10. Specifically, the court reasoned that granting the plaintiff leave to file the second amended complaint was evidence that the plaintiff's claims were not frivolous. Id. The Cullins court found that the plaintiff's claims were not clearly frivolous where the court granted the plaintiff leave to file her Second Amended Complaint after her Amended Complaint was dismissed without prejudice. [2010 BL 173523], 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87669 , 2010 WL 3008833 , at *3. Here, the Court granted Relator leave [*13] to amend the complaint as well.
Relator next argued that this action could not be found frivolous when the evidence supporting Relator's sealed Motion for Partial Summary Judgment showed that Eisai knowingly provided the OAR Program kickbacks, thus proving one of the main schemes alleged in the Third Amended Complaint. Relator argued that, given the stakes and the equities, it was vital for the Court to review the summary judgment motion. The court never reached the substantive arguments raised in the motion for summary judgment. Therefore, the undersigned will not rely upon those allegations in determining entitlement to costs.
The undersigned finds that the Relator's position regarding the pleading standard to be applied was not frivolous. Although Relator's claims were not ultimately successful, the undersigned finds that they were not so lacking in arguable merit so as to be clearly frivolous.
2. Vexatious/Harassment.
"[A]n action is 'clearly vexatious' or 'brought primarily for purposes of harassment' when the plaintiff pursues the litigation with an improper purpose, such as to annoy or embarrass the defendant." Bane, [2009 BL 91256], 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35771 , 2009 WL 1148632 , at *5; Cullins, [2010 BL 173523], 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87669 , 2010 WL 3008833 , at *4. Such conduct may be evident in, inter alia, actions that deliberately delay the proceedings, that attempt to re-litigate a previously decided claim against the same defendant, the raising of new allegations in an effort to circumvent the arguments in a defendant's motion to dismiss, or where the government's undisputed prior knowledge of information alleged to constitute fraud defeated any inference of a false claim. Id. "'The distinction between vexatious conduct and harassment turns on the intentions of the plaintiff. Although the word 'harassment' suggests bad faith on the part of the plaintiff, the term 'vexatious' in no way implies that the plaintiff's subjective bad faith is a necessary prerequisite to a fee award against him.'" Id. (internal citations omitted).
Eisai argued that the Relator engaged in vexatious conduct by filing amended complaints that failed to cure the noted deficiencies, while pursuing discovery and motion practice that unnecessarily increased the cost of the litigation. Eisai also pointed to the September 28, 2012, hearing on the motion to dismiss the Third Amended Complaint wherein Relator could not identify the particulars of the alleged fraud. According to Eisai, whether under a subjective or objective standard, there was no basis to believe that the Third Amended Complaint, which suffered from the same deficiencies as the First Amended Complaint, would survive dismissal.
Relator argued that it did not pursue this action for an improper purpose. Although Eisai cast Relator as a disgruntled employee who, after settling a wrongful termination suit against Eisai, prosecuted this action to extract more money from Eisai, at no time did Relator make a settlement demand from Eisai. Relator claimed that he brought the employment law action to resolve his own claim for damages arising from his termination and brought the instant [*14] action for the Government, believing Eisai had unlawfully caused it to part with funds. Moreover, Relator noted that whistleblowers were incentivized through the FCA to file qui tarn suits that would expose such wrongdoing. Finally, Relator argued that he and his counsel "lost their shirts" in this case. As noted in Cullins, Relator's expenses can demonstrate his good faith belief in the merits of the case and belie any ulterior purposes, such as harassment of Eisai. [2010 BL 173523], 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87669 , 2010 WL 3008833 , at *4.
The undersigned finds that, based upon this record, there is insufficient evidence to establish that Relator brought this action primarily to harass Eisai or that Relator pursued the litigation with an improper purpose, such as to annoy or embarrass Eisai. Indeed, Judge Williams noted that, although Relator had failed to establish his FCA claims, there may still be allegations falling outside the purview of the FCA for which Eisai may be subject to liability under other statutes. (ECF No. 232) at 38. Clearly, the Court was not of the opinion that Relator's claims were frivolous or vexatious. See Cullins, [2010 BL 173523], 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87669 , 2010 WL 3008833 , at *4 (denying attorney's fees under the FCA upon finding that the relator's claims were neither clearly frivolous nor clearly vexation or for the primary purpose of harassment where the court had dismissed the amended complaint without prejudice with leave to re-file); Gross, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7302 , 2004 WL 905952 , at *10 (denying attorney's fees under § 3730 because the suit was not vexatious or frivolous although the second amended complaint was dismissed with prejudice for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted). Accordingly, on this record, the undersigned finds no evidence to support an award of attorney's fees against Relator.
B. 28 U.S.C. § 1927 .
Eisai also sought fees under § 1927 from Messrs. Grover, Lehrman, and Gitkin only-not their law firms and not Relator.
Section 1927 provides that any attorney "who so multiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously may be required by the court to satisfy personally the excess costs, expenses, and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred because of such conduct." 28 U.S.C. § 1927 . Courts may impose sanctions upon finding that (1) an attorney has engaged in "unreasonable and vexatious" conduct; (2) the "unreasonable and vexatious" conduct multiplied the proceedings; and (3) the dollar amount of the sanction bears a financial nexus to the excess proceedings such that the sanction does not exceed the costs, expenses, and attorney's fees reasonably incurred because of the sanctionable conduct. Hudson v. Int'l Computer Negotiations, Inc., 499 F.3d 1252 , 1262 (11th Cir. 2007)(quoting Peterson v. BMI Refractories, 124 F.3d 1386 , 1396 (11th Cir. 1997)). However, the statute does not operate as a catch-all provision for sanctioning objectionable conduct by counsel. Peterson, 124 F.3d at 1396 . There must be a connection between counsel's objectionable conduct and multiplication of proceedings that would not have occurred otherwise. Id . 
An attorney "unreasonably and vexatiously" multiplies proceedings within the meaning of § 1927 "only when the attorney's conduct is so egregious that it is 'tantamount [*15] to bad faith.'" Amlong & Amlong P.A. v. Denny's, Inc., 500 F.3d 1230 , 1239 (11th Cir. 2007) (quoting Avirgan v. Hull, 932 F.2d 1572 , 1582 (11th Cir. 1991)). Such bad faith requires more than negligent conduct or lack of merit.  Id. at 1241-42 ; Schwartz v. Millon Air, Inc., 341 F.3d 1220 , 1225 (11th Cir. 2003) ("For sanctions under section 1927 to be appropriate, something more than a lack of merit is required) (citation omitted). "Bad faith is the touchstone. Section 1927 is not about mere negligence." Schwartz, 341 F.3d at 1225 (internal citations and quotations omitted). Bad faith is measured by the attorney's objective conduct. Amlong & Amlong, 500 F.3d at 1239-40 . Although the court may impose sanctions even if the attorney acted without the specific purpose or intent to multiply the proceedings, it is important to consider the attorney's subjective state of mind.  Id. at 1241-42 . Bad faith may be found where an attorney "knowingly or recklessly" pursues frivolous claims or needlessly obstructs the litigation of non-frivolous claims. Id. at 1242 ; Schwartz, 341 F.3d at 1225 .
Upon review, the undersigned finds that the conduct cited by Eisai, as noted herein, is insufficient to support a fee award against Relator's counsel under 28 U.S.C. § 1927 .
1. Unreasonable and vexatious conduct.
Eisai argued that courts have found unreasonable and vexatious conduct where an attorney filed and prosecuted factually or legally unsupported claims, or where an attorney failed to abandon a claim once it became apparent that the evidence would not support it. Eisai relied on Avirgan v. Hull, wherein the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the district court's award of attorney's fees and costs when the plaintiffs' attorneys refused to abandon a case after discovery made clear that no evidence existed to substantiate the complaint's allegations. 932 F.2d at 1582 . Eisai argued that the Court's June 21, 2011 Order dismissing the First Amended Complaint set forth in detail what Relator needed to plead in order to survive a motion to dismiss. However, Relator failed to do so in the subsequent amended pleadings.
The undersigned finds that there is no indication that the filing of the amended complaints or the discovery in this case were unreasonable or vexatious. Judge Williams noted that Relator had the opportunity to litigate his claims of fraud but was unable to establish a sufficient link between Eisai, doctor, and government programs. (ECF No. 232) at 38. However, she noted that it was not known whether the allegations were true or whether another insider could have pursued the case. Id. At no time did the Court intimate that Relator's counsel had engaged in any unreasonable or vexatious conduct with respect to this litigation.
2. Multiplying proceedings.
Multiplication of proceedings includes, but is not limited to, abuse of discovery tactics, reassertion of meritless claims, and any other conduct that results in lengthening the proceedings. American Honda Motor Co., Inc. v. Motorcycle Information Network, Inc., No. 5:04-cv-12-Oc-10GRJ, [2008 BL 68484], 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97949 , 2008 WL 906739 , at * 13 (M.D. Fla. Apr. 2, 2008). Eisai argued that Relator's filing of four unsupported complaints, as well as requiring Eisai to engage in extensive and expensive discovery and motions practice was exactly the type [*16] of conduct § 1927 was designed to deter.
Eisai pointed to Relator's refusal to agree to a stay pending ruling on the motion to dismiss and insistence that discovery go forward as evidence of improper conduct. According to Eisai, between December 16, 2011, and February 29, 2012, it undertook a company-wide search of documents, ultimately resulting in the production of about 2 million pages of text-searchable documents, along with a privilege log. Because Eisai knew that complying with the discovery deadline of February 2012 would be costly, Eisai's counsel attempted unsuccessfully to reach agreement with Relator to stay discovery pending ruling on the motion to dismiss, or to narrow the discovery requests. Eisai argued further that the third-party discovery failed to produce any evidence supporting Relator's claims. Notwithstanding, Relator pressed on which forced Eisai to prepare for and defend several depositions at great expense.
Next, Eisai argued that Relator multiplied the proceedings by engaging in unnecessary motion practice. Relator filed motions requesting that the Court delay ruling on Eisai's motion to dismiss arguing, in part, that it would be prejudicial if his anticipated motion for summary judgment was not considered at the same time as Eisai's motion to dismiss. See (ECF No. 172, 216). Moreover, instead of complying with the expert disclosure deadline, Relator provided Eisai with the names and addresses of five putative experts, along with the curricula vitae for four of them, but failed to include any other information required by Rule 26. On the day his expert reports were due, Relator filed a motion seeking a nine-month extension of all pre-trial deadlines, but not the mediation deadline. (ECF No. 202).
Relator argued that he did not multiply the proceedings and that he properly engaged in court-mandated discovery. Judge Ungaro had denied Eisai's motion to stay discovery pending ruling on the motion to dismiss. Not only did the local rules provide that a motion to dismiss would not delay discovery, but discovery was ordered by the Court. Thus, it cannot be said that it was Relator's fault that discovery proceeded. Relator's argument in this regard is well-taken.
Finally, Relator argued that the court should not find bad faith where he was granted leave to amend the pleadings. Even though the Third Amended Complaint was dismissed with prejudice, Judge Williams' 39-page Order of dismissal represented a lengthy, detailed analysis of the issues presented, such that this action cannot be considered frivolous. (ECF No. 232). Moreover, the Eleventh Circuit granted oral argument on appeal tending to indicate that the case had some merit. Relator argued that he pursued this case in good faith, as evidenced by the fact that Relator's counsel spent a considerable amount of money in pursuing this FCA case. In this regard, Relator argued that the fact he was able to obtain counsel to represent him indicated that his claim was not clearly frivolous.
The undersigned is persuaded by Relator's arguments. Considering [*17] the circumstances in this case, the undersigned finds that there is no basis in this record upon which to award attorney's fees to Eisai pursuant to § 1927 . There is no indication that the filing of the amended complaints, the discovery, or the motion practice in this case were vexatious or multiplied the proceedings.
C. Court's inherent power.
Finally, Eisai argued that the Court should exercise its inherent power and sanction Relator and his attorneys and their firms for their bad faith conduct. Relator argued that a fee award against a law firm required a specific finding that the firm willfully abused judicial process by engaging in subjective bad faith conduct and no such evidence had been presented.
Courts have the inherent power to assess attorney's fees and costs as a fine when a losing party has "acted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly or for oppressive reasons." Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32 , 45-46 , 111 S.Ct. 2123 , 2133 , 115 L.Ed.2d 27 (1991)(citations omitted); Kreager v. Solomon & Flanagan, P.A., 775 F.2d 1541 , 1543 (11th Cir. 1985). Grounds for a bad faith award exist when the plaintiff brings a groundless suit and forces the defendant to expend time and effort conducting its defense. Gordon v. Heimann, 715 F.2d 531 , 539 (11th Cir. 1983).
Having found no grounds to award Eisai attorney's fees under the FCA or § 1927 , the undersigned finds that there is no basis to entertain a fee award under the Court's inherent power.
The undersigned notes that, in this case, Judge Ungaro dismissed without prejudice the First Amended Complaint, with leave to file an amended complaint. (ECF No. 61). She found that Relator stated a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) , but that his claims were not pleaded with the degree of particularity required by Rule 9(b) , because Relator failed to describe specifically what Eisai did to cause false claims to be submitted, omitted critical details of claim presentation, and did not describe how the alleged kickbacks "crossed the line from legal conduct in compliance with federal statutes to illegal kickbacks." (ECF No. 61). In dismissing the Third Amended Complaint, Judge Williams found that, although Relator had expanded his pleading and raised additional arguments to support his FCA claims, the complaint failed to provide the requisite particularity to survive dismissal. (ECF No. 232). Judge Williams emphasized that her limited review of the case left many questions unanswered.  Id. at p. 37. She noted that it was not known whether Relator's allegations were actually true, or whether another insider or the government could have pursued this case. Id. Moreover, she noted that there may still be other allegations falling outside the purview of the FCA which may subject Eisai to liability under other statutes by other parties.  Id. at 3 8. Finally, Judge Williams noted that Relator had the opportunity to litigate his claims of fraud but was unable to establish a sufficient link between Eisai, doctors, and government programs. Id. Given these circumstances, there is simply no basis upon which to base a fee award to Eisai.
Conclusion 
Accordingly, it is hereby RESPECTFULLY RECOMMENDED as follows:
1. That Defendant Eisai [*18] Inc.'s Motion to Tax Costs Against Relator Michael Keeler, and Bill of Costs (ECF No. 237) be Granted-in-part and Denied-in-part, and Eisai be awarded the amount of $31,365.00 in costs. In this connection, Relator may file substantial financial documentation of his inability to pay for the Court's consideration within five (5) days. The undersigned recommends that any determination as to a cost judgment on behalf of Eisai be stayed pending consideration of any such submission by Relator.
2. That Defendant Eisai Inc.'s Motion for Entitlement to Attorneys Fees and Costs (ECF No. 255) be Denied.
Pursuant to S.D. Fla. Magistrate Rule 4(b) , the parties may serve and file written objections to this Recommendation with the Honorable Kathleen M. Williams, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Florida, within fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this Report and Recommendation. Failure to file timely objections shall bar the parties from attacking on appeal any factual findings contained herein. RTC v. Hallmark Builders, Inc., 996 F.2d 1144 (11th Cir. 1993); LoConte v. Dugger, 847 F.2d 745 (11th Cir. 1988).
RESPECTFULLY RECOMMENDED in Chambers, at Miami, Florida, this 30 day of March 2015.

WILLIAM MATTHEWMAN, UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE.

WILLIAM MATTHEWMAN 
ORDER DENYING PLAINTIFFS' MOTION TO COMPEL [DE 219]
THIS CAUSE is before the Court upon Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel. [DE 219]. Defendants, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC, and Morgan Stanley, filed a Response. [DE 224]. These matters were referred to the undersigned by United States District Judge Kenneth A. Marra [DE 43], and they are now ripe for review.
This is an FLSA action for unpaid overtime wages. Plaintiffs are current and former pre-production Financial Analyst Assistants ("FAAs"), who assert that Defendants failed to pay them for all of their hours worked, including overtime hours.
In their Motion, Plaintiffs ask this Court to order Defendants to provide additional electronically-stored information ("ESI"). Specifically, Plaintiffs ask Defendants to perform and produce additional ESI searches on additional records custodians above the branch level and also asks Defendants to produce training records. [DE 219].
I. General Discovery Principles 
"It is well established that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 'strongly favor full discovery whenever possible.'" Adelman v. Boy Scouts of Am., 276 F.R.D. 681 , 688 (S.D. Fla. 2011) (quoting Farnsworth v. Procter & Gamble Co., 758 F.2d 1545 , 1547 (11th Cir. 1985)). "Rule 26(b) therefore permits a party to obtain discovery of 'any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the claim or defense of any party.'" Id . (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b) ). "The Courts have long held that relevance for discovery purposes is much broader than relevance for trial purposes." Dunkin' Donuts, Inc. v. Mary's Donuts, Inc., No. 01-0393, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25204 , 2001 WL 34079319 , at *2 (S.D. Fla. Nov. 1, 2001). "Discovery should ordinarily be allowed under the concept of relevancy unless it is clear that the information sought has no possible bearing on the subject matter of the action." Id. 
Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(1) , "a court may limit discovery of relevant material if it determines that the discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or obtainable from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive, or the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs the likely benefit." Henderson v. Holiday CVS, L.L.C., 269 F.R.D. 682 , 686 (S.D. Fla. 2010). "The party resisting discovery has a heavy burden of showing why the requested discovery should not be permitted." Id . "To meet this burden, the party resisting discovery must demonstrate specifically how the objected-to request is unreasonable or otherwise unduly burdensome." Id . "It is settled that, electronically stored information is discoverable under Rule 34(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [*6] ." Wynmoor Community Council, Inc. v. QBE Ins. Corp., 280 F.R.D. 681 , 685 (S.D. Fla. 2012).
II. Additional ESI from Additional Custodians 
Plaintiffs ask that Defendants produce additional ESI from their "human resources personnel, corporate level employees, or any management level employees of Defendants which refer or relate to hours worked, overtime or off the clock work by any Discovery Opt-In during their employment as FAAs." [DE 219, p. 2]. Plaintiffs maintain that these individuals—who are above the branch level—will have relevant and discoverable ESI pertaining to Defendants' "policies, procedures and practices regarding the off-the-clock study time by pre-production FAAs." [DE 219, p. 2]. Plaintiffs argue that "Defendants should be required to search and produce emails for human resources personnel, corporate level employees, or any management level employees of Defendants using the ESI protocols and search terms the Parties previously agreed to apply to the email searches for the branch level personnel."
Defendants oppose Plaintiffs' request for additional ESI, explaining that they are "already conducting expensive and time-consuming ESI at Plaintiff's request." [DE 224, p. 1]. Furthermore, Defendants maintain that Plaintiffs' requests are "vague and ambiguous, overbroad, and unduly burdensome." [DE 22, p.3]. Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' requests for additional ESI from "human resources personnel," "corporate level employees," and "management employees" are so vague and overbroad that they cannot determine to whom Plaintiffs are actually referring. [DE 224, p. 3]. Defendants also take issue with the fact that Plaintiffs failed to place any time limits on their requests. [DE 224, p. 3]. Moreover, Defendants take issue with the fact that Plaintiffs failed to justify their request for additional ESI; Defendants point out that Plaintiffs have not demonstrated the likelihood that individuals above the branch level would have any information relevant to their claims. [DE 224, p. 4].
The Court denies Plaintiffs' request for additional ESI from custodians above the branch level. As they point out in their Motion, Defendants are already engaged in large-scale ESI production, involving at least 166,000 documents and likely more. [DE 224, p. 2]. The Court finds that Plaintiffs' request for additional ESI is unduly burdensome, overbroad, and overly vague. The Court further finds that the considerable burden Defendants would have to bear in producing the additional ESI Plaintiffs request would far outweigh the benefits.
In support of their argument, Plaintiffs cite Martinez-Hernandez v. Butterball, LLC, [2010 BL 114309], 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 50246 , 2010 WL 2089251 (E.D.N.C. May 21, 2010). However, Martinez-Hernandez does not support Plaintiffs' position and is factually inapposite from this case. In Martinez-Hernandez, the Court simply found that certain individuals may be sources of relevant ESI—the Court did not find, as a general rule, that unnamed persons above the branch level of a company should or could possess relevant ESI to support a Plaintiff's claim. Martinez-Hernandez[*7] , [2010 BL 114309], 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 50246 , 2010 WL 2089251 , at *4-5. Martinez-Hernandez does not support production of additional ESI from unidentified individuals above the branch level in this case.
III. Training Records 
Additionally, Plaintiffs ask this Court to order Defendants to produce the training materials used by pre-production FAAs. [DE 219, p. 3]. According to Plaintiffs, these materials are relevant to their FLSA claims for three reasons: first, "they would likely include materials regarding the requirements for pre-production FAAs to pass certain examinations, as well as the study-time expected and required to pass such examinations;" second, the training materials' uniformity would further support Plaintiffs argument that they are similarly situated, further buttressing their position that that case should proceed as a class action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 ; and third, "the sheer volume of the materials is relevant to the amount of time Plaintiffs were expected to study in order to pass their required exams."
Defendants oppose Plaintiffs' request for FAA "training materials." Defendants maintain that this request is unduly burdensome and overbroad, as Plaintiffs fail to specify with reasonable particularity what sorts of "training materials" they seek. [DE 224, p. 5]. Defendants also note that "training materials" is not an official or recognized term. [DE 224, p. 5]. Defendants also point out that they have already produced "Knowledge Link" records which document the classes the second-round Discovery Opt-In Plaintiffs took while training in the pre-production phase of the FAA program. Defendants maintain that providing more information would be unduly burdensome, as "they would have to track down the different materials used by each individual, including different versions of particular texts, as not all Discovery Opt-Ins went through the program in the same year." [DE 224, p. 5]. Finally, Defendants assert that having additional training records would not help support Plaintiffs' argument that the case should proceed as a class action, as not all FAAs took the same training courses. [DE 224, p. 5].
The Court denies Plaintiffs' request for "training materials." In support of their argument, Plaintiffs rely on Henderson, supra . However, that case does not support Plaintiff's position as to the relevance of the training documents generally; Henderson only made a fact-specific finding that documents relating to the training program in that case should be produced. The Court further notes that, in Henderson, Plaintiffs requested a specific batch of training documents relating to the "SMD training program." Henderson, 269 F.R.D. at 691 . In this case, Plaintiffs fail to make such a specific request, instead requesting "training documents." "Training documents" could refer to a myriad of different materials, and it would place an undue burden on Defendants to have to entertain such an overly broad and unduly burdensome discovery request. Furthermore, as Defendants note in their Motion [DE 224], Defendants have already produced the Knowledge Link records; in light of this, production of additional "training [*8] materials" would only prove to be redundant and unnecessary. Any benefit to Plaintiffs from the production of "training materials" would not outweigh the great burden Defendants would have to shoulder in producing such a voluminous amount of information.
In light of the foregoing, it is hereby
ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that Plaintiff's Motion to Compel [DE 219] is DENIED.
DONE AND ORDERED in Chambers this 7th day of April, 2015 at West Palm Beach, in the Southern District of Florida.

ORDER REGARDING ELECTRONICALLY STORED INFORMATION
Based upon the Parties' Joint Notice (DE # 50), and a review of the record, the Court ORDERS as follows:
1. This Order supplements all other discovery rules and orders. It streamlines Electronically Stored Information ("ESI") production to promote a "just, speedy, and inexpensive determination" of this action, as required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 1 .
2. This Order may be modified by stipulation of the parties for good cause. If the parties cannot resolve any disagreements regarding any modifications, the parties shall submit their competing proposals and a summary of their dispute pursuant to all applicable rules or standing orders.
3. Costs will be shifted for disproportionate ESI production requests pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26 . Likewise, a party's nonresponsive or dilatory discovery tactics will be cost-shifting considerations.
4. A party's meaningful compliance with this Order and efforts to promote efficiency and reduce costs will be considered in cost-shifting determinations.
5. General ESI production requests under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 34 and 45 shall not include metadata absent a showing of good cause. However, fields showing the date and time that the document was sent and received, as well as the complete distribution list, shall generally be included in the production.
6. General ESI production requests under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 34 and 45 shall not include email or other forms of electronic correspondence (collectively "email"). To obtain email parties must propound specific email production requests.
7. Email production requests shall only be propounded for specific issues, rather than general discovery of a product or business.
8. Email production requests shall be phased to occur after the parties have exchanged initial disclosures and basic documentation about the patents, the prior art, the accused instrumentalities, and the relevant finances. While this provision does not require the production of such information, the Court encourages prompt and early production of this information to promote efficient and economical streamlining of the case. The exception to paragraph 8 is that Citrix will produce emails related to its knowledge and/or notice of the patents-in-suit or related patents, if any such emails exist after a reasonable search, by August 14, 2012, so that Pragmatus may review these materials in advance of the September 14, 2012, deadline to amend the pleadings.
9. The parties shall cooperate to identify the proper custodians, proper search terms and proper timeframe.
10. Each requesting party shall limit its email production requests to a total of five custodians per producing party for all such requests. The parties may jointly agree to modify this limit without the Court's leave. The Court shall consider contested requests for up to five additional custodians per producing party, upon showing a distinct need based on the size, complexity, and [*2] issues of this specific case. Should a party serve email production requests for additional custodians beyond the limits agreed to by the parties or granted by the Court pursuant to this paragraph, the requesting party shall bear all reasonable costs caused by such additional discovery.
11. Each requesting party shall limit its email production requests to a reasonable set of search terms per custodian per party to be agreed upon by the parties prior to any searching being conducted. The parties may jointly agree to additional search terms without the Court's leave. The Court shall consider contested requests for additional search terms per custodian, upon showing a distinct need based on the size, complexity, and issues of this specific case. The search terms shall be narrowly tailored to particular issues. Indiscriminate terms, such as the producing company's name or its product name, are inappropriate unless combined with narrowing search criteria that sufficiently reduce the risk of overproduction. A conjunctive combination of multiple words or phrases (e.g., "computer" and "system") narrows the search and shall count as a single search term. A disjunctive combination of multiple words or phrases (e.g., "computer" or "system") broadens the search, and thus each word or phrase shall count as a separate search term unless they are variants of the same word. Use of narrowing search criteria (e.g., "and," "but not," "w/x") is encouraged to limit the production and shall be considered when determining whether to shift costs for disproportionate discovery. Should a party serve email production requests with search terms beyond the limits agreed to by the parties or granted by the Court pursuant to this paragraph, the requesting party shall bear all reasonable costs caused by such additional discovery.
12. The receiving party shall not use ESI that the producing party asserts is attorney-client privileged or work product protected to challenge the privilege or protection.
13. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 502(d) , the inadvertent production of a privileged or work product protected ESI is not a waiver in the pending case or in any other federal or state proceeding.
14. The mere production of ESI in a litigation as part of a mass production shall not itself constitute a waiver for any purpose.
15. In the event that production of an ESI document would be impracticable, the producing party shall have the option of producing such document in native format. In all other instances, after initial production of ESI, a party must demonstrate a particularized need for production of that ESI in its native format. In the event that a receiving party requests production of native format ESI, the producing party and the receiving party shall negotiate in good faith about the timing, cost and method of such production. However, nothing in this Paragraph, except pursuant to 16, is to be read as requiring any producing party, absent agreement or court order, to produce ESI in native format. No document produced in native format shall be intentionally manipulated [*3] to change the appearance or substance of the document prior to its collection.
16. Notwithstanding Paragraph 15, to the extent a producing party produces video, animation, audio files or Excel files such documents shall be produced in their native format.
17. To the extent identical copies of an ESI document (i.e., documents with identical hash values) appear in responsive documents, the producing party need only produce one such identical copy for that source.
DONE AND ORDERED.

DOUGLAS N. FRAZIER, UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE.

DOUGLAS N. FRAZIER 
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION 
TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
This cause is before the Court on the parties' Joint Claim Construction Statement (Doc. 131) filed on May 1, 2013; the Plaintiff, Technology Innovations, LLC's Opening Claim Construction Brief (Doc. 139) filed on June 3, 2013; the Defendants, Open Text Corporation and NStein Technologies, Inc.'s Responsive Claim Construction Brief (Doc. 145) filed on June 25, 2013; and Technology Innovations, LLC's Reply Claim Construction Brief (Doc. 146) filed on July 9, 2013. Also pertinent to the claim construction issues are Open Text Corporation and NStein Technologies, Inc.'s Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 91) filed on November 16, 2012, and Technology Innovation LLC's Response to Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 101) filed on December 11, 2012. On September 10, 2013, the Honorable Sheri Poster Chappell, United States District Judge entered an Order (Doc. 150) which referred the issues of claim construction to this Court for the issuance of a Report and Recommendation.
A Markman 1 hearing was held on July 22, 2014. After the Markman hearing, the parties filed a Joint Statement Regarding Claim Construction (Doc. 162) on August 1, 2014. Technology Innovations filed a Rebuttal to Defendants' Argument at the July 22, 2014 Markman Hearing (Doc. 164) on August 13, 2014; Open Text Corporation and NStein Technologies, Inc. filed a Reply to Plaintiff's Rebuttal to Defendants' Arguments at July 22, 2014 Markman Hearing (Doc. 168) on August 25, 2014; and, Technology Innovations filed a Response to Defendants' Reply to Plaintiff's Rebuttal to Defendants' Arguments at the July 22, 2014 Markman Hearing (Doc. 171) on September 5, 2014.
I. Background 
The Plaintiff, Technology Innovations, LLC ("Technology Innovations") is suing the Defendants, NStein Technologies, Inc. and Open Text Corporation (collectively "Open Text") for patent infringement concerning U.S. Patent No. 6,829,613 (the "'613 patent ") issued on December 7, 2004, and entitled "Techniques for Controlling Distribution of Information from a Secure Domain". (Doc. 66, P11). Technology Innovations asserts that NStein Technologies, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Open Text Corporation. (Doc. 66, P2).Technology Innovations contends that it is the owner by assignment of all right title and interest in and to the '613 patent . (Doc. 66, P11). For purposes of generally understanding the patent only, the Abstract provides that the patent is a technique for controlling distribution of information from a secure domain by automatically detecting any outgoing message to determine if the message violates a security policy. (Doc. 66-1, Abstract). This technique is able to determine the content of a message, compare the content of the message to certain message categories, and determine a degree of similarity of the content between the outgoing message and the message categories. (Doc. 66-1, Abstract). The outgoing message is classified and a determination is made whether the outgoing message may be distributed or would violate a security policy. (Doc. 66-1, Abstract). The overriding dispute in this case is whether the '613 patent includes document retrieval systems, or if it is more limited to security issues and determining whether messages may leave a secure domain.
II. Legal Framework for Claims Construction 
The court and not the jury has the responsibility to construe or interpret disputed terms in patent claims. Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 517 U.S. 370 , 390-91 , 116 S. Ct. 1384 , 134 L. Ed. 2d 577 (1996). "It is a 'bedrock principle' of patent law that 'the claims of a patent define the invention to which the patentee is entitled the right to exclude.'" Phillips v. AWH Corp., 415 F.3d 1303 , 1312 (Fed. Cir. 2005), citing, Innova/Pure Water, Inc. v. Safari Water Filtration Systems, Inc., 381 F.3d 1111 , 1115 (Fed. Cir. 2004). The words of the claim are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning. Phillips v. AWH Corporation, 415 F.3d at 1312 , See also, Biogen IDEC, Inc. v. Glaxosmithkline LLC, 713 F.3d 1090 , 1095 (Fed. Cir. 2013)(citing Epistar Corp. v. Int'l Trade Comm'n, 566 F.3d 1321 , 1334 (Fed. Cir. 2009)). "We have made clear, moreover, that the ordinary and customary meaning of a claim term is the meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art in question at the time of the invention, i.e. as of the effective filing date of the patent application."  Id. at 1313 , See also, Thorner v. Sony Computer Entertainment Am., 669 F.3d 1362 , 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2012). How a person of ordinary skill in the art understands a claim term provides an objective baseline from which to begin a claim interpretation. Id . Inventors typically are persons skilled in the field of inventing and the language in the patents is addressed to others who are also skilled in the pertinent field or art. Id . A person of ordinary skill in the field is deemed to read the terms in the claim in the context of the entire patent including the specification. Id . "In some cases, the ordinary meaning of claim language as understood by a person of skill in the art may be readily apparent even to lay judges, and claim construction in such cases involves little more than the application of the widely accepted meaning of commonly understood words."  Id at 1314 . Then, general dictionaries may be helpful. Id . When the terms of the claim are not readily apparent and have a particular meaning in a field or art, then the Court must look to the intrinsic evidence of the words of the claims themselves, the remainder of the specification, the prosecution history, and then look to the extrinsic evidence of the scientific principles, the meaning of technical terms, and the state of the art. Id . 
A. Claim Language and Specification (Intrinsic Evidence) 
The claim itself provides substantial guidance in determining the meaning of the language. Phillips v. AWH Corporation, 415 F.3d at 1314 . A court should look to the context of the term. Id . A court should also review the other claims of the patent to determine the meaning of the language in the claim. Id . Claims must also be read in view of the specification.  Id at 1315-16 . A specification may provide a special definition for a claim term that differs from its general meaning, and in such cases the "inventor's lexicography governs."  Id. at 1316 . The language in the specification, however does not "'import limitations from the specification into the claims.'" Varco, L.P. v. Pason Systems USA Corp., 436 F.3d 1368 , 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2006), (quoting CollegeNet, Inc. v. Apply Yourself, Inc., 418 F.3d 1225 , 1231 (Fed. Cir. 2005)). Claims may not be broader in scope than the invention that is set forth in the specification. On Demand Machine Corp. v. Ingram Industries, Inc., 442 F.3d 1331 , 1340 (Fed. Cir. 2006). It is necessary to consider the specification as a whole and to read all of the portions of the written description so that the patent as a whole is internally consistent. Pfizer, Inc. v. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., 429 F.3d 1364 , 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2005).
A claim term may be more narrowly construed than it ordinary meaning in two instances: "1) when a patentee sets out a definition and acts as [its] own lexicographer, or 2) when the patentee disavows the full scope of a claim term either in the specification or during prosecution." (internal quotation marks omitted) Aventis Pharma S.A. v. Hospira, Inc., 675 F.3d 1324 , 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting Thorner v. Sony Computer Entertainment Am. L.L.C., 669 F.3d 1362 , 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2012)). A patentee acts as its own lexicographer when the patentee sets forth a definition of a disputed claim term giving it "other than its plain and ordinary meaning." (internal quotation marks omitted) Id . (citing Thorner v. Sony Computer Entertainment Am. L.L.C., 669 F.3d 1362 , 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2012)(quoting CCS Fitness, Inc. v. Brunswick Corp, 288 F.3d 1359 , 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2002)). "Similarly, to disavow claim scope, '[t]he patentee may demonstrate intent to deviate from the ordinary and accustomed meaning of a claim term by including in the specification expressions of manifest exclusion or restriction, representing a clear disavowal of the claim scope.'" Id . citing Thorner, 669 F.3d at 1366 (quoting Teleflex, Inc. v. Ficosa N. Am. Corp., 299 F.3d 1313 , 1325 (Fed. Cir. 2002)).
It is generally impermissible to limit a claim to a preferred embodiment or to any inferences drawn from the description of the preferred embodiment. Bell Atlantic Network Services, Inc. v. Covad Communications Group, Inc., 262 F.3d 1258 , 1273 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Even if the specification describes a very specific embodiment, the claims are not confined to the embodiment described. LizardTech, Inc. v. Earth Resource Mapping, Inc., 433 F.3d 1373 , 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2006). "In particular, we have expressly rejected the contention that if a patent describes only a single embodiment, the claims of the patent must be construed as being limited to that embodiment." Id ., (citing Gemstar-TV Guide v. Int'l Trade Comm'n, 383 F.3d 1352 , 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2004)), See also, Kapusta v. Gale Corp., 155 F. App'x 518 (Fed. Cir. 2005).
"To avoid importing limitations from the specification into the claims, it is important to keep in mind that the purposes of the specification are to teach and enable those of skill in the art to make and use the invention and to provide a best mode for doing so." Phillips v. AWH Corporation, 415 F.3d at 1323 . Although the task to determine if the preferred embodiment is the outer limit of the claim or merely an example of the invention may be difficult, the Federal Circuit has found that "attempting to resolve that problem in the context of the particular patent is likely to capture the scope of the actual invention more accurately than either strictly limiting the scope of the claims to the embodiments disclosed in the specification or divorcing the claim language from the specification." Id . "Nonetheless, absent a clear disclaimer in the specification, the embodiments in the specification do not limit broader claim language." Eolas Technologies Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 399 F.3d 1325 , 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2005)(citing Liebel-Flarsheim Co. v. Medrad, Inc.., 358 F.3d 898 , 907-08 (Fed. Cir. 2004)). Even if the only embodiment or all of the embodiments contain a certain limitation, a court cannot read this limitation into the claim. Thorner v. Sony Computer Entertainment Amer. LLC, 669 F.3d 1362 , 1366-67 (Fed. Cir. 2012).
B. Prosecution History (Intrinsic Evidence) 
The prosecution history which is the complete record of the proceedings before the Patent and Trademark Office is considered part of the "intrinsic evidence" for claim construction purposes. Phillips v. AWH Corporation, 415 F.3d at 1317 . The prosecution history shows how the inventor and the Patent and Trademark Office understood the patent. Id . The prosecution history is generally less useful than the specification because it is the ongoing negotiations of the applicant and the Patent and Trademark Office and lacks the clarity of the specification. Id . "Disclaimers based on disavowing actions or statements during prosecution, however, must be both clear and unmistakable." Sorensen v. International Trade Commission, 427 F.3d 1375 , 1379-80 (Fed. Cir. 2005), (citing Omega Eng'g. Inc. v. Raytek Corp., 334 F.3d 1314 , 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2003)). Further, it is the applicant and not the examiner who must "'give up or disclaim subject matter'" that would otherwise be included within the scope of the claim. Sorensen, 427 F.3d at 1380 , (quoting Innova/Pure Water, Inc., 381 F.3d at 1124 ). The statement of an examiner alone will not necessarily limit a claim. Bell Atlantic Network Services, Inc. v. Covad Commc'ns Group, Inc. 262 F.3d 1258 , 1273 (Fed. Cir. 2001).
C. Dictionaries, Treatises (Extrinsic Evidence) 
Extrinsic evidence is less significant and less reliable than intrinsic evidence. Phillips v. AWH Corporation, 415 F.3d at 1317 , 1318 . Dictionaries and treatises, especially technical dictionaries, may be helpful and technical dictionaries may help the court with technical terms.  Id. at 1318 .
III. Claim Construction of Disputed Claims 
There are four disputed claims, two independent and two dependent claims at issue in this case. As set forth in the '613 patent , they are:
A. The 2 Independent Claims at Issue 
1. A computer-implement method of controlling distribution of a message from a sender to a recipient, the method comprising:
constructing semantic models for a plurality of message categories;
constructing a semantic model for the message;
comparing the semantic model of the message with the semantic models for the plurality of message categories;
classifying the message based on the comparison; and
determining if the message can be distributed to the recipient based on the classification of the message.
(Doc. 66-1, 17:5-172 )

23. A computer program product for controlling distribution of a message from a sender to a recipient, the computer program product comprising:
code for constructing semantic models for a plurality of message categories;
code for constructing a semantic model for the message;
code for comparing the semantic model of the message with the semantic models for the plurality of message categories;
code for classifying the message based on the comparison;
code for determining if the message can be distributed to the recipient based on the classification of the message;
and
a computer-readable medium for storing the codes.
(Doc. 66-1, 19: 21-36)

B. The 2 Dependent Claims at Issue 
19. The method of claim 1 wherein determining if the message can be routed to the recipient comprises:
providing a security policy;
determining if the message violates the security policy based on the classification of the message; and
permitting distribution of the message to the recipient if the security policy is not violated.
(Doc. 66-1, 18:55-62)

41. The computer program product of claim 23 wherein the code for determining if the message can be routed to the recipient comprises:
code for providing a security policy;
code for determining if the message violates the security policy based on the classification of the message; and
code for permitting distribution of the message to the recipient if the security policy is not violated.
(Doc. 66-1, 21:18-25).

All of the terms to be construed in the two independent claims are identical, just as the one term to be construed in the dependent claims is identical. Therefore, the Court will construe the same terms in the same manner for the independent claims and likewise for the dependent claims.
C. Agreed Claim Construction Terms 
The 2 terms that the parties have agreed upon are:
"computer-implement" can be construed as "computer-implemented"
"routed" can be construed as "distributed"
(Doc. 131, Exh. A). Other terms or words were agreed upon after the initial Joint Claim Construction Statement (Doc. 131) was filed, and these agreed upon terms will be set forth below as they relate to each disputed term.

V. Overview of Patent 
Before construing the actual terms in dispute, the Court will review the entire patent as a whole. The location of a statement in a patent "can signal the likelihood that the statement will support a limiting definition of a claim term." C.R. Bard Inc. v U.S. Surgical Corp, 388 F.3d 858 , 864 (Fed. Cir. 2004). To determine the scope of the patent, "[s]tatements that describe the invention as a whole, rather than statements that describe only preferred embodiments, are more likely to support a limiting definition of a claim term." Id . (citing Digital Biometrics, Inc. v. Identix, Inc., 149 F.3d 1335 , 1347 (Fed. Cir. 1998) ("relying on global comments made to distinguish the applicants' claimed invention from the prior art during the prosecution of the patent in construing a claim term.") (internal quotation marks omitted)). The Summary of the Invention and the Abstract sections of the specification normally describe the patent as a whole, and are generally not limited to describing a preferred embodiment, but rather describe the patent and the overall invention more broadly. Id . (quoting Microsoft Corp. v. Multi-Tech Sys., Inc., 357 F. 3d 1340 , 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2004). "Accordingly, other things being equal, certain sections of the specification are more likely to contain statements that support a limiting definition of a claim term than other sections, although what import to give language from the specification must, of course, be determined on a case-by-case basis. Id . 
In addition, when a patent describes the "present invention" as a whole, then this description "limits the scope of the invention." Verizon Servs. Corp. v. Vonage Holdings Corp., 503 F.3d 1295 , 1308 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Further, when construing a claim, the problem that the inventor is attempting to solve as found in the specification and prosecution history is also relevant to construing the terms of the patent. CVI/Beta Ventures, Inc. v. Tura LP, 112 F.3d 1146 , 1160 (Fed. Cir. 1997).
Technology Innovations asserts that Open Text improperly imports the terms "boundary," "secure" or "security" into independent claims 1 and 23. Open Text argues that in the Abstract, Summary of Invention, and description of the "present invention" the '613 patent is limited to electronic messages leaving a secure domain. The Court recognizes that claims 1 and 23 do not contain the terms "secure", "security" or "boundary". However, the Court notes that the title of the patent is "Techniques for Controlling Distribution of Information From a Secure Domain." (Doc. 66-1). In the Abstract, the first sentence is as follows: "[t]echniques for controlling distribution of information from a secure domain by automatically detecting outgoing messages which violate security policies corresponding to the secure domain." (Doc. 66-1, Abstract). The Abstract then describes constructing semantic models for message categories for the outgoing message and comparing them to semantic models of message categories to determine the "degree of similarity between the semantic models." (Doc. 66-1, Abstract). The outgoing message is classified based on the degree of similarity obtained from the comparison. (Doc. 66-1, Abstract). Based on the classification of the outgoing message, a determination is made if distribution of the outgoing message would violate a security policy for the secure domain. (Doc 66-1, Abstract). Distribution of the outgoing message "is allowed if no security policy is violated." (Doc. 66-1, Abstract). Clearly, the Abstract contains the terms "secure" and "security" repeatedly.
The Summary of the Invention also contains the limiting language of "secure." "The present invention describes a system, method, and computer program for controlling distribution of a message from a secure domain to a destination outside the secure domain." (Doc. 66-1, 2:54-57). Later, the patent provides that "the present invention is a meaning-based boundary controller which controls the distribution of information crossing the boundary of a secure domain by automatically detecting outgoing messages which violate security policies corresponding to that security domain." (Doc. 66-1, 4:21-25). Again referring to "boundary," "secure" and "security."
The language in the Abstract, Summary of Invention, and "present invention" all provide that this patent is for technology which controls the distribution of information from the boundary of a secure domain using the content of the message and comparing it to message categories to determine the similarity of the outgoing message with the message categories, and then making a determination based on the degree of similarity as to whether the outgoing message will violate a security policy. With this construction in mind, the Court will construe the terms of the patent in dispute.
VI. Claim Differentiation 
Technology Innovations asserts a number of Open Text's constructions of disputed terms violates the claims differentiation doctrine The doctrine of claim differentiation provides that normally limitations "stated in dependent claims are not to be read into the independent claim from which they depend.'" Innova/Pure Water, Inc. v. Safari Water Filtration Sys., 381 F.3d 1111 , 1123 (Fed. Cir. 2004)(citation omitted). Each claim in a patent is presumed to have a different meaning and scope. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company v. Andrx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 343 F. Supp. 2d 1124 , 1142 (S. D. Fla. 2004). "'To the extent that the absence of such difference in meaning and scope would make a claim superfluous, the doctrine of claim differentiation states the presumption that the difference between claims is significant.'" Andersen Corp. v. Fiber Composites, LLC, 474 F.3d 1361 , 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2007)(citing Tandon Corp. v. U.S. Int'l Trade Comm'n, 831 F.2d 1017 , 1023 (Fed. Cir. 1987).
Technology Innovations argues repeatedly that the terms "boundary," "secure" and "security" do not appear in independent claims 1 and 23, but do appear in the dependent claims, including claims 19 and 41. Technology Innovations argues that by using the terms "boundary", "secure" and "security" the dependent claims become superfluous or redundant of the independent claims. As the Court determined above, the terms "boundary," "secure" and "security" appear throughout the patent beginning in the title of the patent, and through the Abstract, Summary of Invention, the "present invention", and the specification. The Court finds that Open Text has not violated the claim differentiation doctrine by including the terms "boundary," "secure" and "security" in its claims construction. Further, the Court determines that Open Text did use certain terms in its claims construction that also appear in the dependent claims, however, none of the terms used by Open Text rendered an entire dependent claim redundant or superfluous.
VII. Prior Art 
The parties agree that the prior Patent No. 5,168,565 ("Morita patent") is a patent of a document retrieval system and was patented prior to the '613 patent . (Tr.4 p. 78, 101). Technology Innovation also filed another patent a '518 application as a continuation of the '613 patent . (Tr. p. 103). The language of claim 1 in the '613 and the original '518 patent were identical. (Tr. p. 103). The original '518 patent was rejected based upon the Morita patent, and the entire patent was later abandoned. (Tr. p. 103, 111).
In the May 29, 2008 Response to the Office Action for the '518 patent , Technology Innovations states, "Morita has nothing whatsoever to do with receiving a message intended for distribution to a recipient outside a secure domain, classifying that message and determining whether the message might violate a security policy." (Tr. p. 105, Exh. 7 to Doc. 139-9, p.6). The inventor did not mention the Morita patent as prior art for the '613 patent , and the patentee has a duty to disclose prior art in the application. (Tr. p. 108). The doctrine of inequitable conduct provides that if an applicant for a patent misrepresents or omits material information, such as prior art, with the "specific intent to deceive" the Patent and Trademark Office, then the remedy is for the court to render the patent unenforceable. Therasense, Inc. v Becton, Dickinson & Co., 649 F.3d 1276 , 1287 (Fed. Cir. 2011) and Levenger Co. v. Feldman, 516 F. Supp. 2d 1272 , 1284 (S.D. Fla. 2007). In the instant case, by its own omission of the Morita patent in the '613 patent application, Technology Innovations determined that the prior Morita patent for a document retrieval system was not prior art for the '613 patent .
VIII. Claim Construction of Disputed Claims 
A. Controlling Distribution (Disputed terms 1 and 2) 
Claim 15 provides in part that the claim is: "A computer-implement[ed] method of controlling distribution of a message from a sender to a recipient." (Doc. 66-1, 17:4-17). The parties initially disagreed as to the term "controlling", however, Technology Innovations now has agreed with Open Text to use the term "controlling" in its claim construction. The parties disagree as to the term "distribution" with Technology Innovations asserting that "distribution" means controlling an "electronic transmission or electronic delivery" whereas Open Text asserts that it means controlling the delivery of a message "at a boundary of a secure domain by determining whether delivery of the message violates a security policy." (Doc. 139, p. 11-12, Doc. 145, p. 12). Technology Innovations objects to Open Text's additional language as to the boundary of a secure domain and violation of a security policy. Technology Innovations argues that claim 1 does not contain the terms "secure" or "security" and that Open Text is importing limitations from the specification.
Technology Innovation cites to the preamble for claim 1 which uses the terms "computer-implement method of controlling distribution of a message." (Doc. 66-1, 17:5-6). Technology Innovations asserts that "distribution" refers to an action performed on something electronic such as an electronic communication. Therefore, Technology Innovation contends that "distribution" means "electronic transmission" or "electronic delivery." (Doc. 139, p. 13). Technology Innovations cites to the Background of the Invention where the word "distributed" is synonymous with the term "communicated." "With the widespread use of computers, an expanding telecommunication network, and the rising popularity of the Internet, an increasing amount of information is now being stored and communicated/distributed in electronic form for both person and business purposes." (Doc. 66-1, 1:49-53). Technology Innovations further cites to the Background of the Invention to construe how information is communicated by using the word "transmitted" in the following sentence:
In particular, communication techniques such as electronic mail (E-Mail), electronic faxes and the like, have made the networks of these organizations susceptible to information leakage problems whereby sensitive information is transmitted to unauthorized users by process/entities with legitimate access to the information."
(Doc. 139, p. 14, Doc. 66-1, 1: 58-63). Technology Innovations also refers to the Morita patent which is a patent of a document retrieval system, and the Morita patent provides that distribution means electronic transmission. (Doc. 139, p. 18).

Open Text cites to the language in the patent. Specifically, Open Text cites to the Summary of the Invention which provides that "controlling distribution" means controlling the distribution of a message from a secure domain to a destination outside the secure domain. (Doc. 66-1, 2:54-57). Open Text then cites to language of the "present invention" which provides that the "present invention is a meaning-based boundary controller which controls the distribution of information crossing the boundary of a secure domain by automatically detecting outgoing messages which violate security policies corresponding to that security domain." (Doc. 66-1, 4:21-25). Open Text then cites to language in the Abstract which states that the patent is a technique for controlling distribution of "information from a secure domain" by detecting outgoing messages which violate a security policies. (Doc. 66-1, Abstract). Statements from the Abstract, Summary of Invention, and language of the present invention are not embodiments and define the scope of the invention in this case. See, C.R. Bard Inc. v U.S. Surgical Corp., 388 F.3d 858 , 864 (Fed. Cir. 2004), Verizon Services Corp. v. Vonage Holdings Corp., 503 F.3d 1295 , 1308 (Fed. Cir. 2007).
Technology Innovations mainly cites to the actual language of the preamble to claim 1 and to the Background of the Invention. To understand the claims, the Court must determine the meaning of the claims. Using the same language as in the preamble does not construe the meaning of the terms. Further, the language in the Background of the Invention is not persuasive as it is not referring to the patent at issue.
The Abstract, Summary of the Invention and the present invention all describe a technique which controls the distribution of a message at a boundary of a secure domain. For the term "controlling distribution" to have meaning, it must indicate where and how a message's distribution will be controlled. To answer the question of where, the present invention defines it as at the boundary of a secure domain, and to answer the question of how, the Abstract and the language of the present invention state that it is done by "automatically detecting outgoing messages which violate security policies." (Doc. 66-1, Abstract, 4:21-25). Therefore, the Court construes "controlling distribution" as "[c]ontrolling the delivery of a MESSAGE at a boundary of a secure domain by determining whether delivery of the MESSAGE violates a predefined security policy."
B. Message (Disputed Term 3) 6 
Technology Innovations asserts that the term "message" is an electronic item that holds information and is capable of being transmitted. (Doc. 162-1). Technology Innovation asserts the term "message" and the term "information" are interchangeable, citing to the Background of the Invention. (Doc. 66-1, 1:40-45). The Background of the Invention provides that the present invention relates "to the field of computer data security and content-based filtering of information." (Doc. 66-1, 1:40-43). Technology Innovations also contends that in the Description of the Specific Embodiments section, the patent provides that Figure 3 depicts a flowchart "for controlling the distribution of information from a secure domain, according to an embodiment of the present invention" and later provides that "[t]he task of controlling [the] flow of information from a secure domain typically involves classifying the information carrying message into one or more categories based on the content of the message . . ." (Doc. 66-1, 5:47-50, 59-64). Technology Innovations cites to these three places within the patent to show that the terms "message" and "information" are used interchangeably, and should be defined as an electronic item that holds information." (Tr. p. 33). Technology Innovations also cites to the Microsoft Computer Dictionary which defines "message" as a "unit of information transmitted electronically from one device to another." (Tr. p. 33). Technology Innovations asserts that its definition comes directly from the patent where it states, "[t]he outgoing message may have various different forms such as an e-mail message with or without attachments, newswire text, web pages, HTML documents, et cetera." (Doc. 66-1, 7:57-60, Tr. p. 34).
Technology Innovations also cites to patent '088 and the Message Understanding Conferences ("MUCs") that were held in the years 1987 through 1993. (See, Doc. 139, p. 18). The Abstract of the '088 patent describes its invention as an "information extraction system that allows users to ask questions about documents in a database, and responds to queries by returning possibly relevant information which is extracted from the documents." (Doc. 139-4, p. 2 Abstract). The MUCs' goal was to "automatically extract information from news texts to populate structured databases." (Doc. 139-4, 2:46-48). Technology Innovations cites to the language in the Background of the Invention in the '088 patent stating "[f]or example, a terrorist organization, "Shining Path" is identified as the perpetrator in a message which has been categorized as a terrorist story within the 'atomic' framework of information extraction." (Doc. 139-4, 3:1-4). Technology Innovations asserts that the term "message" is more than an electronic communication because in the '088 patent and MUCs, the term was used to refer to a newspaper article.
Open Text asserts that a message is an "electronic communication" and not simply an electronic item. (Tr. p. 128). In the Background of the Invention of the '613 patent , the patent provides that "[w]ith widespread use of computers, an expanding telecommunication network, and the rising popularity of the Internet, an increasing amount of information is now being stored and communicated/distributed in electronic form for both personal and business purposes." (Doc. 66-1, 1:49-53). Open Text asserts that the information at issue is not only stored but also communicated or distributed. Open Text argues that the Background of the Invention also provides that in the past, security personnel would manually "monitor the contents of information carrying messages which originate in a secure domain and whose destination lies outside the secure domain or of messages whose sender is a member of a secure domain but whose recipient is not a member of the secure domain" showing that the invention involves information that is communicated. (Doc. 66-1, 2:8-13). The Background of the Invention provides examples of information which includes "communication techniques such as electronic mail (E-Mail), electronic faxes, and the like . . ." (Doc. 66-1, 1:58-60). Open Text contends that a message is an electronic communication that originates within a secure domain and is being sent to a destination outside the secure domain, and not an electronic item that holds information, but may not be communicated.
The Court determines that the term "message" is an electronic communication. The Background of the Invention discusses the rising popularity of communication in electronic form and the increased connectivity of the "free flow of information" and how this increased flow of information is causing security problems. (Doc. 66-1, 1:49-58). The Background of the Invention clearly provides that prior to this invention, security personnel would monitor outgoing communications from the secure domain that were traveling outside of the secure domain, and provides examples such as e-mails and electronic faxes. In addition, as stated by Technology Innovations, the Morita patent involved a "document retrieval system for retrieving registered documents from a document database. Morita has nothing whatsoever to do with receiving a message intended for distribution to a recipient outside of a secure domain, classifying that message and determining whether the message might violate a security policy." (Doc. 139-9, p. 5, Response to Office Action). The '613 patent was differentiated from the Morita patent because it involved messages that are distributed and not just documents. (Tr. p. 131). The Court reviewed the language in the '088 patent and the MUCs and is not persuaded that the term "message" in those documents actually defined the term for the '613 patent . The language in the entire '613 patent provides a construction for the term "message" and the Court finds that the term "message" is an electronic communication.
Open Text argues that Technology Innovations construes "message" to mean an open-ended list of electronic items such as an e-mail, documents, etc. Technology Innovations asserts that there is no need to include in the definition of a "message" that it must include text and meta-information about the specified recipient. Technology Innovations cites to the language in the patent that "[t]he outgoing message may have various different forms such as an E-mail message with or without attachments, newswire text, web pages, HTML documents, etc." (Doc. 66-1, 7:57-60).
Open Text asserts that a message must include both text and meta-information. Directly below the sentence cited by Technology Innovations is the following:
[a]s shown in FIG. 5, the present invention parses the outgoing message to extract meta-information (or function fields) from the outgoing message (step 86). For example, meta information for an Email message may include message sender information, message recipient information (information about a direct recipient or a "carbon-copy" recipient), sender's classification level information, a recipient's classification level information, time stamp information for the message, text information for the message, etc.
(Doc. 66-1, 7:61-67, 8:1-2). Open Text argues that the meta-information is necessary to determine where the message is to be delivered, and information about the sender and recipient to determine the level of security clearance for both to be able to compare them, to determine if the message may be delivered. The invention provides that a "[m]eta-information interpreter receives an outgoing message and parses the message into functional fields" (Doc. 66-1, 11:67, 12:1-2). The Summary of the Invention provides that "[t]he present invention may determine a security clearance level for the sender of the message, the recipient, and for the message category to which the message was classified." (Doc. 66-1, 3:13-16). Open Text also cites to the language in the patent that "[t]he meta-information may vary for different types of out-going message or may even vary within the same type of outgoing messages. The content of the meta-information or the functional fields are then processed by a knowledge extraction system, such as the KNOW-IT system, to extract knowledge representations for the outgoing message (step 88)." (Doc. 66-1, 8:3-9).

The Court determines that the term "message" must include text and meta-information. The invention involves an electronic communication that contains both text and meta-information. The meta-information is used by a system such as KNOW-IT to determine information about the security levels of the sender, recipient, and to extract knowledge representations for the outgoing message. If the message did not contain both the text and meta-information, then the invention, at a minimum, would be unable to determine the security levels of the recipient. Therefore, the Court determines that the term "message" contains both text and meta-information.
Technology Innovations objects to Open Text including the language "by a SENDER for a specified RECIPEINT outside the secure domain" arguing that every message does not always have a pre-determined sender and recipient. Open Text argues that its definition which uses the terms "sender" and "recipient" further describes who the electronic communication is from and to whom it is going. In the Summary of Invention, the invention provides that it controls an electronic communication sent from a sender inside a secure domain to a recipient outside of the secure domain. (Doc. 66-1, 2:54-57). The Court determines that the term "message" must have a sender and recipient, and the sender must be attempting to send the electronic communication outside of the secure domain. The term "secure domain" is consistent with this Court's construction of the terms "controlling distribution" to mean "controlling the delivery of a message at a boundary of a secure domain." Therefore, the Court determines that the term "message" is construed as "[a]n electronic communication created by a SENDER for a specified RECIPIENT outside the secure domain, which includes (1) text and (2) meta-information about the specified RECIPIENT. A MESSAGE originates in a secure domain and is intended for a destination outside a secure domain."
C. Sender (Disputed Term 4) and Recipient (Disputed Term 5) 
Technology Innovations construes the term "sender" as "a source of a message being transmitted" and the term "recipient" as "[a] destination or prospective target for a message being transmitted." Whereas Open Text construes the term "sender" as "[a] person who is a member of a secure domain who sends a MESSAGE to a specified RECIPIENT," and the term "recipient" as "[a] person who is not a member of the secure domain and is specified by the SENDER to receive the MESSAGE." (Doc. 162-1). Technology Innovations argues that the phrase "member of a secure domain" is too limited, and the sender does not have to be a member of a secure domain. Open Text asserts that the invention concerns people who send a message from a secure domain to recipients who are not members of the secure domain. The Background of the Invention provides that prior art employed a security person to monitor messages from a secure domain traveling outside the secure domain, and the Summary of the Invention provides that the present invention controls the distribution "of a message from a secure domain to a destination outside the secure domain." (Doc. 66-1, 2:12-14, 2:54-57). The Court determines that the term "sender" encompasses being within a secure domain, and the term "recipient" encompasses being outside of the secure domain.
Technology Innovations argues that the terms "sender" or "recipient" should not be limited to a person. (Tr. p. 40). Technology Innovations argues that in the '518 application , the examiner referred to a keyboard as a sender and the recipient as a server, and therefore, a sender and recipient should not be limited to a person. (Tr. p. 41-42). Open Text asserts that the only time in the patent that the terms "sender" and "recipient" are described, they are described as people, such as in an example of a newsgroup application. "[T]he people who submit messages to the newsgroup can be considered as belonging to one secure domain . . ." (Doc. 66-1, 4:31-34). Open Text also argues that the present invention uses natural language processing, which can only refer to the human language, and not a computer language. The patent provides, "[t]his is accomplished using natural language processing and information retrieval techniques and knowledge-base technologies which enable the present invention to understand and synthesize rich, conceptual-level representations of the meaning of the message categories and the outgoing messages." (Doc. 66-1, 14:39-44). The Court determines that the use of the term "natural language" requires that the term "sender" and the term "recipient" be people and not a keyboard and server. Therefore, the Court will construe the term "sender" to be "[a] person who is a member of a secure domain who sends a MESSAGE to a specified RECIPIENT" and the term "recipient" to be "[a] person who is not a member of the secure domain and is specified by the SENDER to receive the MESSAGE."
D. Semantic Model (Disputed Term 6) 
Technology Innovations asserts that the term "semantic model" is "[a] semantic representation of a message or message category that includes text other than words contained in the message or the message category." (Doc. 162-1). Technology Innovations asserts that the term "semantic model" and "semantic representation" are used interchangeably throughout the patent citing to the Summary of the Invention: "a machine learning module which compares the semantic representations of the manually classified message and the message category to which the message was manually classified. The semantic model of the message category may be updated based on the comparison." (Doc. 66-1, 3:38-33-37). Technology Innovations also included the terms "text other than words contained in the message or the message category" to differentiate the present invention from the prior art of comparing "dirty" words or a simple key word matching invention.
Open Text asserts that a "model" is a "set of knowledge representations." Open Text refers to the specification which states that "the present invention is a modular meaning-based domain boundary controller which understands the semantic content of security classification guides, message categories, and outgoing messages. The present invention constructs semantic knowledge representations for a plurality of message categories and for outgoing messages and compares the semantic representations at the level of conceptual content." (Doc. 66-1, 14:32-39). In addition, the Guard-It proposal which was attached as an exhibit to the '613 patent and incorporated into the '613 patent , provides that "[t]he capacity is new, since it involves a unique combination of natural language processing and information retrieval techniques to convert succinct security classification topics into rich knowledge representations." (Doc. 145-4, Guard-It p. 2). Open Text argues that these semantic models allow the invention to monitor messages based on the meaning of the content of the message. The Court determines that "structured knowledge representations" comprise a "model."
Open Text contends that to obtain the meaning of a message, a semantic model must include a set of structured knowledge representations, which are concepts and relations that have been taken from the text associated with the message category or the message. The '613 patent provides:
A knowledge extraction system then extracts rich structured knowledge representations from the text segments retrieved in step 80 (step 82). An example of a knowledge 30 extraction system is the "KNOW-IT'' system, developed by Textwise LLC of Syracuse. The KNOW-IT system accepts text as input and extracts semantic relations between the concepts expressed in the texts. These concepts and relations provide a representation of the meaning expressed by the texts. The concepts and relations are represented as "concept-relation-concept" triples (or CRCs), or "relation-concept" tuples (or RCs). The CRCs and RCs encapsulate a generalized representation of the structure and meaning of each text segment. The set of CRCs and RCs extracted from the text segments constitute a semantic model of the structured meaning of the corresponding message category. For further information on the use CRCs and RCs please refer to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/795,658 filed Feb. 6, 1997 which issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,076,088 , and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/280,228 filed Mar. 29, 1999, the entire disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference for all purposes. The knowledge representations assigned to the text segments constitute a semantic releasability model for the corresponding message category.
(Doc. 66-1, 7:28-50). The '613 patent further provides that "[k]nowledge extraction system 120 converts the text segments into a knowledge representation which specified the conceptual meaning of the message category and constitutes the semantic model for the message category." (Doc. 66-1, 11: 49-52).

Upon review of the patent, the Court determines that the semantic model is a set of structured knowledge representations which consist of concepts and relations. The present invention contains references to the knowledge representations, and extracts semantic relations between the concepts expressed in the texts. Both the concepts and relations are crucial to determining the meaning of the content of the message and message categories. Therefore, the Court will construe the term "semantic model" to be "a set of structured knowledge representations which consist of concepts and relations that represent the meaning expressed by the MESSAGE/MESSAGE CATEGORY."
E. Message Categories (Disputed Term 7) 
The parties agree that the term "message categories" means "categories to which messages can be classified as belonging." (Tr. p. 49, 148). Open Text continues with its construction adding "where each category (1) is associated with descriptive text, and (2) has an associated security clearance level independent of SENDER or RECIPIENT." (Doc. 162-1). Technology Innovations argues that this additional language imports improper limitations from a specific embodiment.
Technology Innovations asserts that claim 1 fails to mention the term "security" and this term should not be a part of the construction of the term "message category." The Court determined above that the term "security" is not improper limitation. Further, the specification provides that a message category has an associated security clearance level. (See, Doc. 66-1, 12:50-60 ("[t]he outgoing message classification information is then passed to security checker"); 13:19-20 ("security clearance levels of the message category and the message"); Abstract, ("the outgoing message is classified based on the degree of similarity obtained from the comparison. A determination is made, based on the classification of the outgoing message, if distribution of the outgoing message would violate a security policy for the secure domain"). The Court finds that the construction of "message categories" properly includes the term "security."
Technology Innovations argues that the term "is associated with descriptive text" adds an unnecessary and extraneous requirement. Open Text cites to the specification which it argues have consistently described a message category as having descriptive text or a topic statement associated with it, and without the descriptive text, the invention would be unable to create a semantic model which would represent the meaning of the message category. The specification provides "the present invention receives textual description (or topic statements) corresponding to the message category for which a semantic model is to be built" (Doc. 66-1, 6:34-36); "[t]he message category description or topic statements are then parsed into their concepts" (Doc. 66-1, 6:53-54); "[d]uring the first stage, the present invention uses natural language processing and information retrieval techniques to generate a set of text segments that are closely related to the meaning of the message category as described by the message category descriptive text provided by the user" (Doc. 66-1, 6:20-24); "expand the representation of the message category description" (Doc. 66-1, 7:22-23); and, "[a]s described above, according to the teachings of the present invention, message categories along with their descriptive information . . . The message category information, which includes message category identification information, and message category descriptive information . . ." (Doc10:54-61). After review of the entire patent, the Court determines that a message category must be associated with a descriptive text for the invention to create a semantic model which would represent the meaning of the message category.
Open Text argues that the security clearance level of the message category must be independent of the sender and recipient. (See, 9:65-67 - 10:1-3) ("the security clearance level of the message category corresponding to the message classification and compare it with the security clearance levels of the outgoing message's sender and recipients."). Pursuant to the patent, the Court agrees that the security level of the message category, sender, and recipient are separate and distinct. After review of the patent, the Court will construe the terms "message categories" to mean "categories to which messages can be classified as belonging, where each category (1) is associated with descriptive text, and (2) has an associated security clearance level independent of SENDER or RECIPIENT."
F. Constructing Semantic Models for a Plurality of Message Categories (Disputed Term 8).
Technology Innovations asserts that the phrase, "constructing semantic models for a plurality of message categories" does not need to be construed once the terms "semantic model" and "message category" have been construed, but if any term does need construction, that term would be "constructing" which Technology Innovations would construe as "making or forming." Open Text asserts this phrase should be construed as follows: "[e]xtracting the meaning of each MESSAGE CATEGORY from the descriptive text associated with each MESSAGE CATEGORY by: (1) using natural language processing and retrieving text segments (different than the words of the text) that relate to the meaning of the text; and then (2) extracting concepts and relations from the retrieved text segments to represent the meaning of the text segments." (Doc 162-1).
Open Text asserts that constructing semantic models is a difficult process and the phrase needs to be construed for understanding. (Tr. p. 150-51). Open Text contends that over half of the specification is directed at how to construct a semantic model. (Tr. p. 150). Open Text's construction has two steps: first, using natural language processing; and second, extracting concepts and relations. (Tr. p. 154). Open Text refers to the patent "[b]roadly, the step of constructing a semantic model for a message category may be accomplished in two stages. During the first stage, the present invention uses natural language processing and information retrieval techniques to generate a set of text segments that are closely related to the meaning of the message category. . . During the second stage, the present invention extracts structured knowledge representation for the message category from the set of text segments retrieved in stage one." (Doc. 66-1, 6:15-34). As to the second stage, a "knowledge extraction system then extracts rich structured knowledge representations from the text segments retrieved in step 80 (step 82). . . . The KNOW-IT system accepts text as input and extracts semantic relations between the concepts expressed in the texts. These concepts and relations provide a representation of the meaning expressed by the texts." (Doc. 66-1, 7:28-36). Later in the patent, the "message category information, which includes message category identification information and message category descriptive information, is then forwarded to parser and semantic tagger 106 which uses various syntactic and semantic analysis techniques to parse the message category information and extract concepts which represent the message category. . . . [and later a lexical database] organizes concepts using various semantic relation such as synonyms or hyponyms." (Doc. 66-1, 10:59-67, 11:1-6).
Technology Innovations asserts that Open Text's construction violates claim differentiation. Claim 1, the independent claim provides that "constructing semantic models for a plurality of message categories"; and claim 2 provides that "constructing the semantic models for the plurality of message categories comprises . . . receiving text segment from a natural language processing information retrieval system . . . [and] extracting knowledge representations from the text segments." (Doc. 66-1, 17, 5:5-31). Technology Innovations asserts that the same language in claim 2 was used by Open Text in construing claim 1 which renders claim 2 redundant.
In the instant case, claim 2 provides 4 limitations all of which are not found in claim 1. The first limitation of "receiving description for the plurality of message categories" is not in Open Text's construction. The second limitation of "receiving text segments from a natural language processing information retrieval system based on the descriptions" requires a "natural language processing information retrieval system," and Open Text's construction does not provide that it retrieve text segments from a natural language processing information retrieval system, but instead states that it uses natural language processing, which is much broader than the language in claim 2. The third limitation provides "extracting knowledge representations from the text segments" whereas Open Text's construction extracts concepts and relations and does not refer to a knowledge representation to make a semantic model. Open Text's construction does not render claims 1 and 2 redundant, and therefore, Open Text has not violated the claim differentiation doctrine.
Open Text's construction of the phrase is consistent with the terms as set forth in the present invention. Therefore, the Court will construe the phrase "Constructing a semantic model for the message" as follows: "Extracting the meaning of each MESSAGE CATEGORY from the descriptive text associated with each MESSAGE CATEGORY by: (1) using natural language processing and retrieving text segments (different than the words of the text) that relate to the meaning of the text; and then (2) extracting concepts and relations from the retrieved text segments to represent the meaning of the text segments."
G. Constructing a Semantic Model for the Message (Disputed Term 9) 
Technology Innovations asserts that the phrase "constructing a semantic model for the message" does not need construction because the separate terms of "semantic model" and "message" have already been constructed. If, however, the Court determines that this phrase needs construing, Technology Innovation asserts that the only term that needs defining is the word "construction" and that should be given its plain meaning of "building." Open Text asserts that the construction should be "extracting the meaning of the MESSAGE by extracting concepts and relations from the meta-information of the MESSAGE to represent the meaning of the MESSAGE. The construction of the SEMANTIC MODEL of the MESSAGE triggers performance of the compare, classify and determine steps." (Soc. 162-1).
Open Text asserts that the patent provides support for its construction. The patent provides "the present invention parses the outgoing message to extract meta-information (or functional fields) from the outgoing message (step 86)." (Doc. 66-1, 7:61-63) "The contents of the meta-information or the functional fields are then processed by a knowledge extraction system, such as the KNOW-IT system to extract knowledge representations for the outgoing message (step 88). (Doc. 66-1, 8:5-9). Open Text asserts that there are differences between constructing semantic models for the message categories and constructing a semantic model for the message. The semantic models for the message categories require two steps using natural language processing whereas the semantic model for the message only requires one step and there is no natural language processing as shown in Figure 6 of the patent. The Court reviewed the terms of the patent and will construe this phrase as "extracting the meaning of the MESSAGE by extracting concepts and relations from the meta-information of the MESSAGE to represent the meaning of the MESSAGE."
Open Text argues that a further sentence should be added, namely, "The construction of the SEMANTIC MODEL of the MESSAGE triggers performance of the compare, classify and determine steps." Open Text argues that first the semantic model of the plurality message categories is constructed, then the semantic model of the message is constructed, and then the next step is to compare, classify and determine. The Court agrees that these are the next steps in the patent process as shown by the terms "comparing," "classifying" and "determining" in the language of the claim 1. At the hearing, Technology Innovations stated that there was no basis for this limitation, but failed to cite to anything, nor did it raise an objection in the briefs filed prior to the hearing. (Tr. p. 53-54). Therefore, the Court determines that "constructing a semantic model for the message" is construed as "extracting the meaning of the MESSAGE by extracting concepts and relations from the meta-information of the MESSAGE to represent the meaning of the MESSAGE. The construction of the SEMANTIC MODEL of the MESSAGE triggers performance of the compare, classify and determine steps."
H. Comparing the Semantic Model of the Message With the Semantic Models for the Plurality of Message Categories (Disputed Term 10) 
Technology Innovations asserts that the phrase "comparing the semantic model of the message with the semantic models for the plurality of message categories" does not need construction because most of the words have been defined previously, and the term "comparing" can be defined as "examining" or "checking." Technology Innovations would be agreeable to construe the term "comparing" as "examining for similarities or differences." Technology Innovations argues while the purpose of comparing "may be to determine a degree of similarity, the comparing step does not necessarily include or incorporate determining a "measurement" of similarities (or differences)." (Doc. 139, p. 39). Technology Innovations cites to the Abstract in support of its argument, which provides, "[t]he semantic model of an outgoing message is compared with the semantic models of the message categories to determine a degree of similarity between the semantic models." (Doc. 66-1, Abstract, see also, 6:4-8). It also cites to the Summary of the Invention which provides, "[a]ccording to an embodiment, the present invention compares the semantic model of the message with the semantic models for the plurality of message categories and determines a degree of similarity between the semantic model of the message and the semantic model for each message category in the plurality of message categories" (Doc. 66-1, 2:66-67, 3:1-4), and further cites to the "outgoing message may then be classified based on the degree of similarity obtained from the comparison performed in step 56 (step58)." (Doc. 66-1, 6:4-8, see also 12:35-39, "assesses the degree of similarity between the message semantic model and message category semantic models").
Open Text asserts that this phrase should be construed as follows: "[d]etermining a degree of similarity between the SEMANTIC MODEL for the MESSAGE and each previously constructed SEMANTIC MODEL for the multiple MESSAGE CATEGORIES." Open Test argues that the phrase in the claim needs construction to show that the "classifying" term requires using the comparison of the semantic models for the message and the message categories that were constructed in disputed terms 8 and 9. Open Text and Technology Innovations cite to the same portions of the patent for their arguments. The patent contains at least three places which state the following phrase: "determining a degree of similarity." (Doc. 66-1, Abstract, 6:4-6, 12:35-39). The language used by Open Text mirrors that of the specification, and the Court finds that this phrase should be construed as follows: "[d]etermining a degree of similarity between the SEMANTIC MODEL for the MESSAGE and each previously constructed SEMANTIC MODEL for the multiple MESSAGE CATEGORIES."
M. Classifying the Message Based on the Comparison (Disputed Term 11) 
Technology Innovations asserts that the phrase "classifying the message based on the comparison" does not require construction because it is comprised of ordinary words with the exception of "message," however if the Court must construe the terms then Technology Innovations argues that this phrase should be construed as "identifying to which message category, if any, a message belongs, using the comparison of semantic models (directly or indirectly)." Technology Innovations argues that the beginning of its construction is similar to the beginning of Open Text's construction. Technology Innovations begins, "[i]dentifying to which message category" and Open Text begins, "[a]fter the comparison, identifying the MESSAGE as belonging to each MESSAGE CATEGORY." Technology Innovations asserts that Open Text's construction reads additional limitations in the phrase "for which the degree of similarity satisfies a preset threshold for that MESSAGE CATEGORY." Technology Innovations cites to a number of places in the patent where the term "classify" or "classification" are used, and the definitions are varied. (See, Doc. 66-1, Abstract, "message is classified"; 1:44-48 "classification of information based on its content. . . based on the classification;" 2:60-65 "message is classified based on the comparison. The present invention then uses the classification information for the message;" and, 3:4-8 "[a] message is classified as belonging to a message category.").
Open Text argues that Technology Innovations' construction fails to provide for what happens after a message is classified. Open Text asserts that this phrase must be construed to include the result of the classification which is the degree of similarity, and determine if the degree of similarity satisfies a preset threshold. Open Text claims that Technology Innovations' construction fails to contain a metric to determine whether a message belongs to a message category. Open Text contends that Technology Innovations would have a message compared to the message categories to determine if the message belongs in a message category. Open Text argues that after having looked to determine if the message had similarities with a message category, some determination must be made based on this comparison to determine if this message belongs to this message category. Open Text asserts that a metric must be used to determine if a message belongs in a message category, arguing that if no metric is used, then the question becomes does the message have to be 10% identical, 50% identical, or 100% identical to the message category to be considered similar to the message category. The patent provides that "[t]he outgoing message is classified based on the degree of similarity obtained from the comparison," (Doc. 66-1, Abstract) and "[i]f the degree of similarity exhibited between a message category semantic model and the outgoing message semantic model is higher than the threshold degree of similarity metric for that message category, then the outgoing message may be classified as belonging to that message category." (Doc. 66-1, 12:42-47).
Open Text agrees that the terms "classify" and "classification" have different meanings within the patent, such as "a classification guide" is different than "classifying a message." (Tr. p. 169). Open Text asserts that if "classify" and "classification" have different meanings within the patent then this term must be defined to clarify its meaning within this phrase.
To classify a message based on the comparison, the Court determines that after the comparison is completed between the message and the message categories, the patent requires that a determination be made as to the degree of similarity that satisfies a preset threshold. The degree of similarity must be determined at the classifying step prior to proceeding to the determining step. If the degree of similarity is not determined at the classifying step, then no determination can be made as to whether the message is sufficiently similar to a message category or not. The Court finds that a metric must be employed. Therefore, the Court construes this phrase as follows: "[a]fter the comparison, identifying the MESSAGE as belonging to each MESSAGE CATEGORY for which the degree of similarity satisfies a preset threshold for that MESSAGE CATEGORY."
N. Determining if the Message can be Distributed to the Recipient Based on the Classification of the Message (Disputed Term 12) 
Technology Innovations begins by proposing that the meaning of "can be" in the phrase "determining if the message can be distributed to the recipient based on the classification of the message" should be construed as "capable of being." (Tr. p. 64). The Court finds that the term "can be" does not need to be further defined, and the plain meaning of the terms is easily understandable.
Open Text proposes the following construction: "After the classification, determining if the distribution of the MESSAGE to the RECIPIENT would violate any security policy for the secure domain using the security clearance level of the MESSAGE CATEGORIES associated with the MESSAGE as a result of the classification." Technology Innovations claims that any language as to security clearance levels is not in the claim, and Open Text is importing limitations into the claim. Technology Innovation also argues that Open Text erroneously relied on the embodiments in the patent to limit the independent claims by adding the terms "secure" and "security." Open Text asserts that the '613 patent concerns security as evidenced by the title, abstract, and the rest of the patent. As the Court determined above, it will permit the terms "secure" and "security" to be used in the claim construction and does not find that using these terms violates the doctrine of claim differentiation. The Abstract provides that this patent is "[t]echniques for controlling distribution of information for a secure domain by automatically detecting outgoing messages which violate security policies corresponding to the secure domain. . . A determination is made, based on the classification of the outgoing message, if distribution of the outgoing message would violate a security policy for the secure domain. Distribution of the outgoing message is allowed if no security policy is violated." (Doc. 66-1, Abstract). Clearly, this patent involves security and secure domains. The Background of the Invention also contains the concept of security and secure domains. As the Court determined above, it will permit the terms "secure" and "security" to be used in the claim construction and does not find that using these terms violates the doctrine of claim differentiation or improperly imports the embodiments into the independent claims to limit them.
Open Text then asserts that the determining step includes two parts, first a rule which is a security policy, and then message category information which is a security clearance level. Open Text cites to the Abstract section in the prior paragraph. Later in the patent, Open Text cites, "[t]he present invention is a meaning-based boundary controller which controls the distribution of information crossing the boundary of a secure domain by automatically detecting outgoing messages which violate security policies corresponding to that security domain." (Doc. 66-1, 4:21-25). These citations to the patent show that Open Text's construction using the terms "determining if the distribution of the message to the recipient would violate any security policy" is appropriate.
Open Text asserts that the determining step should include the following, "using the security clearance level of the message categories associated with the message." Open Text then cites to the patent which provides, "[a]fter an outgoing message has been classified, the present invention may determine[s], based on the outgoing message classification, if the outgoing message may be distributed outside the boundaries of the secure domain . . . In one embodiment, the boundary controller computer system may be configured to determine the security clearance level of the message category corresponding in the message classification and compare it with the security clearance levels of the outgoing message's sender and recipients." (Doc. 66-1, 9:59-67, 10:1-8). Open Text's construction is found within the patent.
Technology Innovations asserts that Open Text's construction violates claim differentiation and relies on the embodiments. Technology Innovations states the determining step construction in claim 1 renders claim 19 redundant or superfluous. Open Text asserts that claim 19 provides after the determining clause, the following occurs: "permitting distribution of the message to the recipient if the security policy is not violated." (Doc. 66-1, 18:61-62). Open Text asserts that in its claim construction for claim 1, it does not provide for what happens after a determination is made. Therefore, Open Text asserts that claim 19 is not superfluous. See, supra, Andersen Corp. v. Fiber Composites, LLC, 474 F.3d 1361 , 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2007). The Court agrees that Open Text's construction does not include what occurs after it is determined that a message can be distributed. Therefore, the Court determines that no violation of the claim differentiation doctrine occurred. The Court will construe this phrase as "[a]fter the classification, determining if the distribution of the MESSAGE to the RECIPIENT would violate any security policy for the secure domain using the security clearance level of the MESSAGE CATEGORIES associated with the MESSAGE as a result of the classification."
I. Permitting Distribution of the Message to the Recipient if the Security Policy is Not Violated (Disputed Term 13) 
The permitting clause, "permitting distribution of the message to the recipient if the security policy is not violated" is in dependent claims 19 and 41. Technology Innovations asserts that this phrase does not need any construction or in the alternative the word "permitted" means "allowing." Open Text construes this phrase as, "[i]f it is determined that a security policy is not violated, forwarding the MESSAGE to the RECIPIENT." Technology Innovations argues that the term "forwarding" used by Open Text is improper and is not the same as permitting or allowing. Open Text asserts that the term "forwarding" is in the specification whereas the term "allowing" is not. Open Text cites to the Summary of the Invention as follows: "[m]essages which do not violate any security policies may be forwarded to the recipient." (Doc. 66-1, 3:20-23). The Court determines that Open Text's construction of this phrase changes the meaning slightly by not incorporating the term "may." Therefore, based upon the terms of the patent, and the Court will construe this phrase as follows: "If it is determined that a security policy is not violated, the MESSAGE may be forwarded to the RECIPIENT."
IX. Conclusion

ORDER ON PATHEON'S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO TAKE DEPOSITIONS
After taking its limit of 10 depositions and after the Court entered an Order [ECF No. 689] permitting Defendant Patheon, Inc. ("Patheon") and the Special ESI Master to take the deposition of the Court-Appointed Forensic Expert, Patheon now wants authority to take additional fact depositions. In its Motion for Leave to Take Depositions [ECF No. 690] Patheon seeks to take another 30(b)(6) deposition and to take a second round of depositions of six Procaps S.A. ("Procaps") officers and/or employees whose depositions were previously taken. Patheon wants each of the seven depositions it requests to be a full seven hours, which means that Patheon is seeking 49 hours of additional depositions.
The defendant in Procaps' federal antitrust lawsuit seeking more than $350 million in treble damages, Patheon asserts two primary grounds for its request for more depositions: (1) Procaps is now pursuing its antitrust claims under a rule of reason analysis but the depositions previously taken were when Procaps proclaimed it would pursue only a per se or quick look case and successfully resisted discovery designed to obtain documents and information concerning rule of reason issues; and (2) Procaps recently produced approximately 115,000 documents -- as the byproduct of a forensic analysis performed by a Court-appointed ESI retrieval expert -- and Patheon did not have these materials available the first time it took the depositions.
Not surprisingly, Procaps objects. It contends [ECF No. 707] that Patheon has not met its burden to justify the depositions. Procaps argues that "most" of the claims and defenses remain "exactly the same" and notes that it has already stipulated that it is not proceeding [*2] under a theory that an inference of anticompetitive effects made from projected or present market shares or market power.
The parties are also feuding over procedural aspects of the requested depositions; Patheon wants them in Washington, D.C. and Procaps' position is that Miami is the more-appropriate venue (assuming that any depositions are permitted in the first place).
For the reasons outlined below, the Court grants in part and denies in part Patheon's motion. Patheon may take one seven-hour 30(b)(6) deposition and may take a total of seven hours of deposition from one or more of the six fact witnesses mentioned in Patheon's motion. Thus, Patheon will be able to take 14 (not 49) hours of additional depositions. The depositions will be in Miami.
The background and analysis are outlined below:
Factual Background
Procaps represented on several occasions that it was pursuing a "per se" or "quick look" type of antitrust claim.
For example, Patheon moved to dismiss the Complaint because, it argued, Procaps did not allege a full rule of reason claim. [ECF No. 34-1]. Procaps objected to the dismissal motion, arguing that the Complaint alleged only a per se theory of liability or a quick look analysis. Therefore, Procaps argued then, it did not need to plead the elements of a rule of reason claim, such as market power or market effects. [ECF No. 37]. The District Court -- which presided over the case before there was full consent to the Undersigned -- denied the motion to dismiss, finding that Procaps had sufficiently alleged a per se antitrust claim [ECF No. 50].
In addition, during discovery disputes, Procaps explained that it would not be pursuing a full-fledged rule of reason approach and argued that this concession rendered certain discovery irrelevant.
Patheon and the Court relied upon Procaps' position and the Court, in effect, brokered an acceptable (to the parties) resolution of significant discovery disputes. That compromise enabled Procaps to avoid providing certain discovery related to the rule of reason type of analysis.
In response to competing summary judgment motions, the Court determined that Procaps' claims would not be assessed under a per se analysis. Instead, the Court concluded that the rule of reason theory would govern. Since that ruling and a later, related ruling denying a reconsideration motion, Procaps has been proceeding on a rule of reason approach. Procaps' lawsuit was filed in December 2012. The Order on the summary judgment motions [ECF No. 565] was entered on July 30, 2014. Procaps filed the reconsideration motion [ECF No. 569] on August 14, 2014, and the Court denied it [ECF No. 603] on October 2, 2014.
Given this change in approach, the Undersigned granted, in part [ECF No. 648], Patheon's motion for leave to serve additional rule of reason discovery. Specifically, the Court required [ECF No. 648] Procaps to answer 16 rule of reason interrogatories. Patheon then filed a motion [ECF NO. 662] to compel better interrogatory answers, which the Court granted in part [ECF No. 678]. That Order required Procaps to provide supplemental answers, [*3] with details, and also directed Procaps to formally advise the Court and Patheon of its position on how it intends to prove an anticompetitive effect on the market.
Still not satisfied with the supplemental answers, Patheon has now filed [ECF No. 699] a motion for failure to comply with discovery order. Patheon has not yet responded to that motion (and the deadline to do so has not yet expired), so the motion is still pending but is not yet ripe.
In its motion for leave to take additional (or renewed) depositions, Patheon advised that it would not comply with Procaps' demand that it define the scope of the depositions because to do so would reveal work product. Nevertheless, Patheon offered to submit a sample under seal for in camera inspection. The Undersigned took Patheon up on its offer and directed [ECF No. 692] Patheon to submit for in camera review a sample of 20 recently-produced documents. Before Patheon complied, Procaps filed a motion for reconsideration [ECF No. 696], arguing, among other things, that it would be unfair to proceed with an arrangement where the Court would substantively evaluate and rely upon documents which Procaps had no opportunity to address.
The Court held a hearing on April 30, 2015 and gave Patheon a choice: it could either not submit any documents for the Undersigned to review in connection with its motion to take additional depositions or it could publicly (i.e., not under seal) file the 20 sample documents (which were concededly not privileged)1 and explain, on a witness-by-witness basis, why a document (or group of documents) supported the request to take additional depositions. Patheon chose to not submit any documents. [ECF No. 701].
Therefore, Patheon's motion for additional depositions is not based on the argument that the newly produced documents contain some type of "smoking gun" document, nor is it based on the argument that a specific document changes the factual landscape to such a degree that renewed depositions of the seven witnesses are essential.
The newly produced documents arose in connection with the Court's appointment of a neutral forensic expert, who conducted an analysis of Procaps' ESI. The expert was appointed without objection from Procaps, which acknowledged that its ESI search efforts were inadequate. The ESI forensic expert who ultimately performed the project in this case was appointed on March 25, 2014. [ECF No. 432]. Although Procaps was permitted to review the ESI located by the neutral ESI expert for privilege, it was not permitted to withhold documents on relevancy grounds. Patheon has not explained how many of the 115,000 documents are relevant to this lawsuit, nor has it pinpointed how many are, for all practical purposes, duplicates of documents or ESI previously produced. According to Patheon's motion (filed April 27, 2015), Procaps produced 91,000 documents from the forensic analysis as of the time the motion was prepared, and it advised that Procaps expected to produce an additional 24,000 documents later that same day, which explains how Patheon arrived at [*4] the 115,000-document description it uses in the motion.
Over Procaps' objection, the Undersigned recently entered an Order [ECF No. 689] permitting the ESI Special Master and the parties to take the neutral forensic expert's deposition. To the best of the Court's understanding, that deposition has not yet occurred.
Analysis
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30(a)(2) requires a party to obtain leave of court to take depositions, in the absence of a stipulation, in four situations, two of which apply here. In particular, Rule 30(a)(2)(A)(i) requires leave if the deposition would "result in more than 10 depositions being taken" by one side and Rule 30(a)(2)(A)(ii) requires leave if the deponent "has already been deposed in the case."
Subsection (i) applies to all seven depositions requested by Patheon and subsection (ii) applies to at least six of the seven and may arguably apply to the seventh, the request for another 30(b)(6) deposition, as well.2 
Courts typically make case-by-case determinations when asked to determine if additional depositions beyond the ten-deposition limit may be taken and when confronted with a request to take a second deposition of a witness whose deposition was already taken. See e.g., San Francisco Health Plan v. Mckesson Corp., 264 F.R.D. 20 (D. Mass. 2010) (denying permission to take depositions of two additional witnesses but authorizing depositions of nine additional witnesses on the condition that the party seeking the additional depositions would pay the reasonable costs incurred by the opposing party for any additional depositions beyond the first five); Byrd v. District of Columbia, 259 F.R.D. 1 (D.D.C. 2009) (in an action by former city employees alleging sexual discrimination and harassment, the trial court granted plaintiffs' motion for leave to take depositions, finding that none of the three depositions at issue "are cumulative or duplicative or impose[] a burden that outweighs their likely benefit"); ClearOne Commc'ns, Inc. v. Chiang, 276 F.R.D. 402 , 404 (D. Mass. 2011) (judgment debtor failed to demonstrate good cause for protective order preventing judgment creditor from taking his deposition a second time in a two-year period; court granted mirror image motion to compel deposition, noting that creditor was seeking information that was "unavailable" when the debtor gave a deposition two years earlier). Cf. Flintkote Co. v. Gen. Acc. Assur. Co. of Canada, 692 F. Supp. 2d 1194 (N.D. Cal. 2010) (permitting further deposition testimony of insurer's witnesses, who previously gave depositions but who were instructed to not answer certain questions about reserves, and directing that additional depositions were warranted to understand charts concerning reserves which were provided after the depositions were taken).
Given that courts evaluate requests for additional depositions on a case-by-case basis, it is hardly surprising to find cases going both ways. See Andrews v. Fowler, 98 F.3d 1069 , 1080 (8th Cir. 1996) (civil rights claimant not entitled to take additional depositions of city council members and other witnesses when she was already permitted to take twelve depositions, two more than permitted without leave of court); Alexander v. Federal [*5] Bureau of Investigation, 192 F.R.D. 20 (D.D.C. 2000) (allowing plaintiffs to take the deposition of a new nonparty witness even though they had exhausted the limit for the number of depositions because the witness' knowledge had only recently come to plaintiffs' attention).
Because of the fact-intensive nature of decisions on the issue of the number of depositions and the ability to take another deposition of a deponent, decisions from other courts are typically not persuasive. The Court has discretion to permit or deny the requested depositions.
Moreover, the reality is that there is not a large, well-developed body of case law on the deposition limits imposed by Rule 30, perhaps because the parties usually resolve any disputes without court intervention. Given the level of acrimony in this case, however, it would be overly optimistic to expect that the two parties here would reach a compromise on Patheon's request for additional depositions. But given the parties' chronic inability to resolve discovery disputes, the Undersigned finds that the following language from Fresenius Med. Care Holdings, Inc. v. Roxane Lab., Inc., No. 2:05-cv-0889, [2007 BL 231263], 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17834 , 2007 WL 764302 , at *3 (S.D. Ohio March 9, 2007) to be instructive and appropriate:
The Court adds an additional comment. There is little motions practice in this district over any issues presented by Rule 30(a) , whether those issues relate to taking more than ten depositions, taking the second deposition of the same witness, or exceeding the 7-hour limit on a deposition set forth in Rule 30(d) . That is because most counsel understand that the Court attempts to interpret these rules in light of reason and practical experience and that the Court will enforce the rules strictly when necessary and relax them when required. The circumstances presented here would, in almost every other case pending in this District, have led to a consensual resolution of the issue because the party at fault in failing to produce an important document would understand that it would be unfair to preclude the opposing party from examining an important witness about the document and that the Court would consider the non-production of the document to be the type of circumstance which would justify a short additional deposition. The fact that the parties in this case were unable to reach such a resolution is, taken together with the extensive amount of motions practice devoted to discovery, a strong indicator that they have lost sight of the goal of resolving discovery disputes reasonably and without intervention of the Court and have chosen instead to litigate every issue, no matter how minor, with a view toward increasing the cost and expense of litigation rather than streamlining its resolution.

Accepting the reality that Procaps and Patheon have generated a substantial number of discovery disputes and that counsel appear to genuinely dislike each other, the Court is nevertheless sensitive to both parties' concerns. From Patheon's perspective, it believes it needs to take significant amounts of additional discovery [*6] to adequately defend against the comparatively new rule of reason theory and to explore the new documents which have been produced. From Procaps' perspective, it has already provided significant amounts of discovery and does not believe that an early discovery snafu (i.e., not adequately searching for ESI) should haunt it for the remainder of the case.
The Undersigned finds that both parties have legitimate concerns. Neither side is completely persuasive, however. The Undersigned finds that Patheon would be unduly prejudiced if no additional depositions were permitted. On the other hand, the Undersigned also finds that Procaps would be unduly prejudiced if all seven depositions were to occur. Therefore, the Court needs to engage in an equity-based balancing test.
In doing so, the Undersigned notes that Patheon has not pinpointed the significance of any specific documents recently produced by Procaps. Regardless of whether a document might be deemed a "smoking gun" or merely substantively significant, Patheon has not targeted any specific documents and has not explained the significance of any of the newly released documents. It could be that much of the new production is cumulative or irrelevant. Although Patheon was (apparently) prepared to submit 20 sample documents under seal for in camera review, it decided to not pursue that option. To be sure, the Undersigned understands that Patheon might not want to reveal its strategy by highlighting which of 115,000 documents it deems most significant or which it wants to use at new depositions or which documents relate to specific witnesses. But Patheon cannot expect the Court to somehow assume that all or most of the documents have substantive significance or that they concern new facts not revealed in previously-produced documents.
On the other hand, it would be naïve and illogical to assume the contrary -- i.e., that none of the 115,000 documents have substantive significance not otherwise disclosed in earlier production.
Concerning Procaps' change in theory (from a per se or quick look approach to a rule of reason approach), it may well be true, to use Procaps' comments, that "most" of the factual claims and defenses raised in the pleadings "remain exactly the same." But most is not all. Therefore, the converse of Procaps' description is that some of the claims and defenses are not "exactly the same." Patheon is entitled to obtain discovery on the comparatively new rule of reason theory now being advanced by Procaps.
The Undersigned appreciates Procaps' desire to obtain more information about the scope of the requested depositions, but I also acknowledge Patheon's logical preference to not reveal its strategies about depositions it hopes to soon take. Therefore, the Court does not have much information about the specific information which Patheon wishes to explore, especially on a witness-by-witness basis.
Under these circumstances, the Court needs to accommodate both parties' views, and has done so with the following ruling:
1. Patheon may take a 30(b)(6) deposition [*7] on issues concerning: (1) the rule of reason theory, (2) new information revealed in the new document production (from the forensic audit project), and/or (3) potential spoliation.
2. This 30(b)(6) deposition is limited to seven hours.
3. Patheon must provide a specific, pinpoint list of the precise issues for the 30(b)(6) deposition. If Procaps objects to any issue and is unable to resolve the dispute after a good faith conferral, then it must immediately contact chambers and request a discovery hearing as quickly as possible. What it cannot do, however, is simply lodge an objection and then not have an appropriately-prepared designee appear at the deposition.
4. Procaps may use one or more designees to answer questions on the topics which Patheon puts on its list. The designation decision is Procaps' and Procaps need not advise Patheon in advance of the 30(b)(6) deposition how many designees it will be producing or their names. It can, of course, disclose that information if it is willing to provide it.
5. Patheon may take seven hours' of deposition testimony from one or more of the six witnesses listed in its motion, limited to the same three topics listed above concerning the 30(b)(6) deposition. Patheon may take the depositions of one, some or all of the six witnesses listed -- but the total amount of deposition time for all witnesses combined will be limited to seven hours. Therefore, to provide an example, Patheon may decide to take Mr. Franco's deposition again for seven hours. If it does so, then it may not take any other fact witness depositions. Alternatively, it can take Mr. Franco's deposition again for 3 hours (but only on the permissible topics), take Mr. Minski's deposition again for 3 hours (only on the three permissible topics) and take Mr. Green's deposition for one hour (on the three categories).
6. To the extent that interpreters are used for either the 30(b)(6) deposition or the fact witness depositions, the time will be adjusted, based on the rule that the use of an interpreter doubles the deposition time. To provide an example, if Patheon retakes the deposition of Mr. Minski for two hours with an interpreter, then Patheon will have used one hour of the seven hours allotted in this order.
7. The depositions will be in Miami. Counsel shall cooperate in coordinating the scheduling of these depositions. The Undersigned will not micromanage these depositions by selecting deposition dates or imposing a precise deadline by which they must be completed. Nevertheless, the parties are by now familiar with the Court's policy of keeping everyone focused on the November 16, 2015 trial date and the overall philosophy that doing something sooner is better than later.
8. The depositions are not designed to give Patheon a second bite at the apple, nor are they intended to permit Patheon to seek to take better depositions or to follow up on issues it now believes it did not adequately cover previously. To the contrary, the depositions are provided solely to prevent undue prejudice to Patheon caused by either the change in legal theory, the new production of documents [*8] or the deletion of ESI. Questions not related to these three categories are not permitted at the depositions authorized by this Order.
9. Each side will bear its own costs and attorney's fees for the limited depositions permitted in this Order.
10. The Court declines to award attorney's fees to either party in connection with Patheon's motion for leave to take additional depositions. Both sides' positions were justified.
Conclusion
The Court grants in part and denies in part Patheon's motion and additional depositions may be taken under the rules outlined above.
DONE AND ORDERED in Chambers, in Miami, Florida, May 5, 2015.

Patheon took the position that its selection of 20 documents (from the approximate 115,000 produced during the forensic examination) is privileged work product. Procaps challenged that legal position. The Undersigned makes no ruling on the question of whether a Patheon submission of 20 documents for review by the Court constitutes attorney work product.

The Advisory Committee Notes to the 1993 Amendments explain that "[a] deposition under Rule 30(b)(6) should, for purposes of this limit [of 10 depositions], be treated as a single deposition even though more than one person may be designated to testify." See Loops, LLC v. Phoenix Trading, Inc., No. C08-1064, [2010 BL 47437], 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29012 , 2010 WL 786030 (W.D. Wash. March 4, 2010) (concluding that "there is no reason to count the depositions as two simply because Plaintiffs divided the topics into two subgroups rather than lumping them into one"). But this does not necessarily answer the question of whether leave of court is necessary in order to take a second 30(b)(6) deposition, regardless of who Procaps produces as the designee and regardless of whether the issues listed are different from those listed on the first corporate deposition. See generally State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. New Horizont, Inc., 254 F.R.D. 227 , 234-235 (E.D. Pa. 2008) (summarizing split in district court decisions). See also 8A, Wright, Miller & Marcus, Federal Practice & Procedure (3d Ed.), § 2104 (noting that "the one-deposition provision could be an obstacle to sensible handling of Rule 30(b)(6) organizational depositions" and urging flexibility because, "although such a deposition is properly regarded as the deposition of an organizational party, rigid insistence on adhering to the one-deposition rule in such circumstances would not make sense"). But see Ameristar Jet Charter, Inc. v. Signal Composites, Inc., 244 F.3d 189 , 192 (1st Cir. 2001) (not plainly wrong for district court to quash a 30(b)(6) subpoena issued without leave when the corporate deponent previously provided two designees to provide deposition testimony two years earlier). Cf. Quality Aero Technology, Inc. v. Telemetrie Elektronik, GMBH, 212 F.R.D. 313 , 319 (E.D.N.C. 2002) (noting that 30(b)(6) "depositions are different from depositions of individuals" and holding that "there is no aspect of the Rules which either restricts a party to a single 30(b)(6) deposition[.]").
The Undersigned is not deciding whether leave is required to take a second 30(b)(6) deposition under the "deponent has already been deposed in the case" provision of Rule 30(a)(2)(A)(ii) . Instead, the Undersigned is granting leave, which obviates the need to wrangle with this thorny question.

LURANA S. SNOW, UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE.

LURANA S. SNOW 
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
THIS CAUSE is before the Court on Relators' Verified Motion and Incorporated Memorandum of Law for Award of Attorneys' Fees and Costs Under 31 U.S.C. § 3730(d)(2) (ECF No. 340), which was referred to United States Magistrate Judge, Lurana S. Snow, for a Report and Recommendation. The motion is fully briefed and ripe for consideration.
This was an action originally brought under the False Claims Act against the Defendant, a university which receives federal funding. In order to establish eligibility for funding, the Defendant agreed that it would not provide any commission, bonus or payment to any employee based on that employee's success in enrolling or securing aid for students. According to the Relators, the Defendant submitted 222,206 false claims, resulting in billions of dollars in damages and civil penalties. After a four-day bench trial, this Court determined that the Defendant had submitted 2 false claims, which had not resulted in any actual damages. The Court imposed a civil penalty of $5,500.00 for each false claim, for a total award of $11,000.00. (ECF No. 318)
The Relators now seek an award of attorneys' fees totaling $1,070,081.00 for work their attorneys performed in obtaining their $11,000.00 in civil penalties. This is based on 712.4 hours of work performed by Ira B. Silverstein at a billing rate of $700.00 per hour, for a total of $498,680.00; 927.[*2] 5 hours performed by Armando A. Ortiz at $265.00 per hour, for a total of $245,787.50; 271.4 hours performed by Dale J. Morgado at $400.00 per hour, for a total of $108,560.00; 8.4 hours performed by Ralph Edward Rosenberg at $300.00 per hour, for a total of $2,520.00; 364.2 hours performed by Michael R. Minkoff at $250.00 per hour, for a total of $91,050.00; 109.3 hours performed by David Perry at $275.00 per hour, for a total of $30,057.50; 503.9 hours performed by law clerks and paralegals at $125.00 per hour, totaling $62,987.50, and 358.1 hours performed by legal assistants at $85.00 per hour, for a total of $30,438.50. (ECF No. 340 at 3-4)
The Relators also request a total of $75,954.351 in expenses, consisting of $19,806.90 for ESI data hosting; $26,295.84 for trial consultant services; $1,750.00 for ESI consultants; $16,275.00 for expert witness fees; $9,652.04 for attorney lodging; $10,173.71 for attorney travel and travel incidentals; $7,777.56 for mediation costs; $5,012.83 for attorney meals; $4,026.83 in costs for document production by third parties, and $1,452.34 in specialized legal research and supplies purchased specifically for this litigation.  Id. at 7.
The Defendant does not dispute that 31 U.S.C. § 3730(d)(2) provides that a person who brings a successful action under the False Claims Act is entitled to an award of reasonable expenses, attorneys' fees and costs. However, the Defendant contends that the Relators are not entitled to any award because of their nominal recovery in this case. Alternatively, the Defendant objects to the hourly rates charged by the attorneys, the total time spent by the attorneys and several categories of expenses. Additionally, the Defendant argues that the Court should impose an across-the-board reduction in the fee amount based on the extremely poor results obtained by the Relators. The Defendant asserts that if the Court determines that an award of attorneys' fees is appropriate, the fee award should be between $25,000.00 and $83,829.10, and that no expenses should be awarded.
II. DISCUSSION 
A. ENTITLEMENT TO AWARD 
The Defendant first argues that the Relators are not entitled to an award of fees and expenses because they recovered only nominal damages.
In Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103 , 113 S. Ct. 566 , 121 L. Ed. 2d 494 (1992), the Supreme Court considered the Fifth Circuit's reversal of an award of attorney's fees in a civil rights case where a plaintiff recovered nominal damages, which was based on a finding that such a plaintiff was not a prevailing party. The Supreme Court held that a plaintiff who recovers nominal damages in a federal civil rights case is a prevailing party for purposes of entitlement to an award of attorneys' fees, but affirmed the Fifth Circuit's reversal of the fee award.  Id. at 113 , 116 . The Court stated, "[a]lthough the 'technical' nature of a nominal damages award does not affect the prevailing party inquiry, it does bear on the propriety of the fees awarded under § 1988 ."  Id. at 114 . "'Where recovery of private damages is the purpose of . . . civil rights litigation, a district court, in fixing fees, is obligated to give primary consideration to the amount of damages awarded as compared to the amount of damages sought.'" Id . (quoting [*3] Riverside v. Rivera, 477 U.S. 561 , 585 , 106 S. Ct. 2686 , 91 L. Ed. 2d 466 (1986) (Powell, J., concurring in the judgment)). Thus, in some instances "even a plaintiff who formally 'prevails' under § 1988 should receive no attorney's fees at all," since "[i]n a civil rights suit for damages, the awarding of nominal damages also highlights the plaintiff's failure to prove actual compensable injury." Farrar, 506 U.S. at 115 . The Eleventh Circuit has recognized that Farrar applies to cases brought under the False Claims Act. United States v. Patrol Services, Inc., 202 Fed. Appx. 357 (11th Cir. 2006).
In the instant case, the Defendant makes a compelling argument that no award of fees and expenses should be made. The Defendant points out, and the Relators do not dispute, that the Relators were seeking $3.48 billion in actual damages and $2.44 billion in civil penalties, for a total of $5.92 billion based on 222,206 alleged false claims. (ECF No. 342 at 1) After a bench trial, this Court determined that the Relators had not proven any actual damages, and had proven only 2 false claims. The Court imposed a civil penalty of $5,500.00 for each claim, for a total of $11,000.00. (ECF No. 318)
Under the analysis of Farrar, this award was sufficient to confer prevailing party status on the Relators, but was so insignificant compared to the damages sought that an award of fees and expenses may not be justified, especially since the Relators were unable to prove any compensable injury. However, Farrar also stated that in such instances the district court has discretion to award low fees rather than no fee at all. Farrar, 506 U.S. at 115 . In light of the fact that the Relators did manage to prove 2 violations, the undersigned believes it appropriate to reduce the claimed fees to an amount more commensurate with the Relators' degree of success. See, Thornton v. Wolpoff & Abramson, L.L.P., 312 Fed. Appx. 161 (11th Cir. 2008).
B. AMOUNT OF FEE AWARD 
This Court must calculate a reasonable attorney fee by utilizing the "lodestar" method described in Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424 , 103 S. Ct. 1933 , 76 L. Ed. 2d 40 (1983), which held that "the most useful starting point for determining the amount of a reasonable fee is the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate," since this computation "provides an objective basis on which to make an initial estimate of the value of a lawyer's services."  Id. at 433 .
The party seeking an award of fees should submit evidence supporting the hours worked and the hours claimed. Where the documentation of hours is inadequate, the district court may reduce the award accordingly. A district court also should exclude from this initial fee calculation hours that were not "reasonably expended."  Id. at 433-34 . Therefore, counsel for the prevailing party "should make a good-faith effort to exclude from a fee request hours that are excessive, redundant, or otherwise unnecessary, just as a lawyer in private practice ethically is obligated to exclude such hours from his fee submission."  Id. at 434 .
The Eleventh Circuit has adopted the lodestar approach as the method to be used in calculating federal statutory fee awards. Norman v. Housing Auth. of Montgomery, 836 F.2d 1292 (11th Cir. 1988). The court must begin by determining [*4] a reasonable hourly rate, which is defined as "the prevailing market rate in the relevant legal community for similar services by lawyers of reasonably comparable skills, experience and reputation."  Id. at 1299 , citing Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886 , 895 , 104 S. Ct. 1541 , 79 L. Ed. 2d 891 (1984). The applicant bears the burden of proving, by direct or opinion evidence, that the requested rate is in line with prevailing market rates. Norman, 836 F.2d at 1299 .
In assessing the relevance of the fee comparables provided by the applicant, the court may consider the factors enumerated in Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express Co., 488 F.2d 714 , 717-19 (5th Cir. 1974): the novelty and difficulty of the issues; skill required to perform the legal service properly; preclusion of other employment by the attorney due to acceptance of the case; the customary fee; whether the fee is fixed or contingent; time limitations imposed by the client or the circumstances; the amount involved and the results obtained; the experience, reputation, and ability of the attorneys; the "undesirability" of the case; the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client, and awards in similar cases. Norman, 836 F.2d at 1299-1300 .
The applicant also bears the burden of documenting his or her time expenditures, and may submit opinions as to their reasonableness.  Id. at 1303 . However, the court "is itself an expert on the question and may consider its own knowledge and experience concerning reasonable and proper fees and may form an independent judgment either with or without the aid of witnesses as to value." Id . 
Once the lodestar amount is computed, "[t]here remain other considerations that may lead the district court to adjust the fee upward or downward, including the important factor of the 'results obtained.'" Hensley, 461 U.S. at 434 . Thus, where "a plaintiff has achieved only partial or limited success, the product of hours reasonably expended on the litigation as a whole times a reasonable hourly rate may be an excessive amount," even in instances where the plaintiff's claims were interrelated, nonfrivolous and raised in good faith.  Id. at 436 . In determining the fee to be awarded in such cases, "the most critical factor is the degree of success obtained." Id . The Hensely court declined to articulate a rule or formula to be applied, holding instead that the "district court may attempt to identify specific hours that should be eliminated, or it may simply reduce the award to account for the limited success."  Id. at 436-37 .
In most instances, the district judge's exercise of discretion in awarding fees will not be disturbed. Thus, in Popham v. City of Kennesaw, 820 F.2d 1570 , 1581 (11th Cir. 1987), a § 1988 civil rights action, the court found no abuse of discretion for a fee reduction of 67% where the plaintiff recovered only 1.5% of his claimed damages. Similarly, in Martinez v. Hernando County Sheriff's Office, 579 Fed. Appx. 710 , 715 (11th Cir. 2014), an FLSA case, the trial court properly reduced the fee award by 75% based on limited results. However, in Andrews v. United States, 122 F.3d 1367 (11th Cir. 1997), an action brought under the EAJA, the court reversed the trial's court's fee award, holding that the court abused its discretion by failing to make a sufficient [*5] reduction in the award based on the plaintiffs' limited success.
1. Hourly Rates 
S.D.Fla. Local Rule 7.3(a) requires that a motion for attorneys' fees set forth "the identity, experience, and qualifications for each timekeeper for whom fees are sought." In the instant case, the Relators have provided this information with respect to all of the billing attorneys and some of the non-attorney timekeepers.
The Declaration of Ira B. Silverstein states that he is a partner in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania office of the law firm of Feldman Morgado, which also has an office in Miami, FL. Mr. Silverstein graduated from Harvard Law School in 1973 and immediately joined the Pennsylvania Bar. He states that the instant case was taken on a contingency basis, but asks that the Court award fees at the firm's customary billing rates, which are $700.00 per hour for himself and between $200.00 and $265.00 per hour for associates. According to Mr. Silverstein, his rate of $700.00 per hour is comparable to those of senior partners in Philadelphia and in the Souther District of Florida. (ECF No. 340-14)
The Declaration of Dale J. Morgado recites that he is an equity shareholder in the Feldman Morgado firm, which is a multi-office firm with 45 employees. Mr. Morgado received his law degree from the University of Connecticut and was admitted to the Connecticut Bar in 2007. He founded the Feldman Morgado firm in 2007 and manages its New York and Miami offices. He regularly charges between $350.00 and $500.00 per hour for his legal services. (ECF No. 340-15 at 1-4)
Mr. Morgado also summarizes the qualifications of other timekeepers. He states that Edward Rosenberg received his law degree from Florida International University in 2009. He is a non-equity shareholder in Feldman Morgado firm and assists Mr. Morgado in managing the Miami office. Mr. Rosenberg's billing rate is $350.00 per hour. Michael Minkoff received his law degree from George Washington University Law School in 2013, and is an associate in the Feldman Morgado firm's complex litigation group. Mr. Minkoff is admitted to practice in state and federal courts of New York and New Jersey, and his billing rate of $250.00 per hour was approved by the court in a case brought in the Southern District of New York. David Perry graduated from the George Washington University Law School and began his career in 1990. He was not offered a partner-tracked associate position at the Feldman Morgado firm in 2012, but was a full-time employee of the firm and was paid a salary. Mr. Morgado's declaration does not state what salary Mr. Perry received.  Id. at 5-6.
Kristen Mella and Noorie Jadeja were summer associates at the Feldman Morgado firm, who were attending law school at the time of the instant litigation. Melissa Jones was a law clerk who had obtained her law degree, but had not passed the bar, and Christina Rubio was a paralegal. Amanda Gonzalez was a legal assistant and chief of staff for the firm's New York office, and Priscilla Maldonado, Gabrielle Petroka, Monica Maura, Laura Kras and Kenia Izagirre were legal assistants. Ashley Rios [*6] served as both legal assistant and paralegal, and Aubrey Levesque served as paralegal and later law clerk. No qualifications are listed for these individuals.  Id. at 6-8.
The Declaration of Armando A. Ortiz states that he is a senior associate with the Feldman Morgado firm and counsel of record for the Relators in this case. He graduated from Suffolk University Law School in 2012. He began his legal career with the Feldman Morgado firm's Miami Office, and currently works at the New York office. Approximately 90% of his practice consist of federal litigation. In 2013, his billing rate was $250.00 per hour.2 (ECF No. 340-16)
Attached to the Defendant's response to the instant Motion is the Affidavit of David Keller, the president and senior shareholder of Keller Landsberg, P.A. Mr. Keller received his law degree from the University of Florida College of Law in 1979, and his fee for reviewing the instant case was $450.00 per hour. The shareholder in his firm who assisted him billed at $350.00 per hour. Mr. Keller's practice is focused on the representation of lawyers and law firms in professional liability cases, and he is very familiar with the rates charged by attorneys throughout Florida in virtually all types of civil cases. (ECF No. 342-1 at 1-2)
Mr. Keller describes Mr. Silverstein's claimed rate as "an extraordinary top-of-the-market rate" which might have been justified had he substantially prevailed in the case.  Id. at 11. Additionally, Mr. Keller points out that the record is devoid of any evidence that Mr. Silverstein ever was paid at that rate or that any court approved it. Mr. Keller also notes that Mr. Silverstein is seeking reimbursement in the amount of $544.01 for a textbook dealing with the litigation of federal false claims, a purchase which belies his expertise in the area.  Id. at 11-12. Mr. Keller suggests that Mr. Silverstein be compensated at a rate of $500.00 per hour, which he describes as "still very handsome by South Florida standards."  Id. at 12. Based on experience with the rates charged by lawyers in this District of similar qualifications and the very poor results achieved in this case, the undersigned agrees.3 Mr. Silverstein's hourly rate should be reduced to $500.00 per hour, which the undersigned believes is very generous under the circumstances of this case.
Mr. Keller suggests the following reduced rates for other Feldman Morgado timekeepers: $200.00 per hour for Mr. Ortiz; $300.00 per hour for Mr. Morgado; $125.00 per hour for Michael Minkoff, and $250.00 per hour for Mr. Perry. Mr. Keller does not address the appropriate rate for Mr. Rosenberg. The undersigned notes that Mr. Morgado has seven years of legal experience; Mr. Rosenberg has five years experience; Mr. Ortiz has two years experience, and Mr. Minkoff has one year. Mr. Perry has 24 years experience, but he was paid an unknown amount as a salary and was not offered an associate's position at the Feldman Morgado firm.
Based on extensive experience with rates charged by lawyers in the Souther District of Florida of comparable qualifications and experience to the attorneys who billed for work [*7] on this case, as well as on direct experience with lawyers handling multiple motions in the case, the undersigned believes that the following rates are appropriate: $350.00 per hour for Mr. Morgado; $300.00 per hour for Mr. Rosenberg, and $200.00 per hour for Mr. Ortiz, Mr. Minkoff and Mr. Perry. The undersigned also finds that the claimed billing rates of $125.00 per hour for law clerks and paralegals and $85.00 per hour for legal assistants are within the range of rates charged for such professionals in this District. Based on these adjusted rates, with no reduction in the number of hours billed, the following lodestar figures result:


Timekeeper

Total Fee

Ira B. Silverstein

$500

712.4

$356,200

Armando A. Ortiz

Law Clerk/Paralegals

$125

503.9

$62,987.50

Legal Assistants

$85

358.1

$30,438.50


Thus, at the adjusted hourly rates, the fee award would be $827,336.00.
2. Hours Claimed 
The Relators seek compensation for a total of 2,393.2 hours of lawyer time and 862 hours of paraprofessional time which they claim were spent on this case, for a total of 3,255.2 hours. In his affidavit, Mr. Keller suggests that a total of 800 hours of attorney time is reasonable. (ECF No. 342-1 at 6) By way of illustration, Mr. Keller notes that counsel for the Relators claim 127 hours, more than three weeks of attorney time, just for preparing the instant Motion.  Id. at 15. Mr. Keller also points out various typographical billing errors; time spent on unsuccessful motions to compel, to disqualify and for summary judgment; time spent prior to the time the suit was filed, as well as other examples of what Mr. Keller believes to be excessive or excludable billing.  Id. at 14-16. Mr. Keller also suggests a substantial reduction in the fee for the poor results obtained, and recommends that the court award a fee of between $25,000.00 (reflecting reduced hourly rates and reduced hours) and $83,829.10 (reflecting reduced hourly rates only).  Id. at 5-6.
The undersigned agrees that there the number of hours spent for the work performed, especially in light of the results achieved, are excessive and warrant an across-the-board reduction in the total fee award. Although this Court could justifiably determine that no fees should be awarded based on the nominal recovery obtained by the Relators, the undersigned believes that a 90-95% reduction is appropriate, and that a reasonable attorneys' fee would be $41,366.80 - $82,733.60. This fee range takes into account policy considerations on all sides (including the encouragement of whistle-blowers, the costs incurred by the Defendant of defending the lawsuit and considerations of judicial economy), and the fact that the suit may have had a positive impact on the Defendant's conduct. Considering all the relevant circumstances of the case, the undersigned recommends an attorney's fee award of $60,000, substantially higher than the bargained-for contingency fee of less than $5,000. (ECF No. 340-1)
C. EXPENSES 
The Relators also [*8] request a total of $75,954.35 in expenses, consisting of $19,806.90 for ESI data hosting; $26,295.84 for trial consultant services; $1,750.00 for ESI consultants; $16,275.00 for expert witness fees; $9,652.04 for attorney lodging; $10,173.71 for attorney travel and travel incidentals; $7,777.56 for mediation costs; $5,012.83 for attorney meals; $4,026.83 in costs for document production to third parties, and $1,452.34 in specialized legal research and supplies purchased specifically for this litigation.
The undersigned already has determined that the $19,806.90 for ESI data hosting was incurred for the convenience of counsel (ECF No. 353 at 9), and the Defendant notes that its own attorneys did not require the assistance of an outside vendor to search and review the same files. (ECF No. 342 at 14 n.19). The undersigned finds that his expense was not reasonable and should be disallowed. Similarly, the $26,295.84 for trial consultants was not reasonable, since these consultants performed a minor function at a trial to an experienced United States District Judge. Additionally, the undersigned notes that the combined cost for ESI and trial consultants was more than four times the total recovery in this case.
The claimed expenses for attorney lodging, travel and meals, totaling $24,838.58, also should not be borne by the Defendant. Feldman Morgado has a Miami office and the Relators have shown no valid reason why this case could not have been handled by one of their Miami attorneys or a Souther District of Florida attorney from another firm. This is particularly evident in light of the fact that the attorneys from outside this District were able to achieve only paltry results. The Defendant also should not have to bear the $1,452.34 incurred for "specialized legal research and supplies purchased specifically for this litigation," which includes the costs of two legal treatises, a printer, a computer program, office supplies and a hand truck, all of which are part of overhead. (ECF No. 340-27)
Regarding mediation costs, the undersigned notes that the claimed expenses include $917.91 for meals, $616.00 for Mr. Silverstein's flight from Philadelphia, $865.50 for lodging, $77.93 for taxis and $311.72 for mediation presentation materials for which no receipt is attached.4 The undersigned finds these were not reasonable expenses, and that the only allowable expense is the $4,988.50 for mediation services. (ECF No. 340-24)
The Defendant contends that the claimed costs of $4,026.83 in expenses for copying by third parties was already included in the Relators' Bill of Costs, and reimbursement for this amount would constitute double recovery. However, the costs awarded to the Relators did not include labor by third parties, and the only cost previously awarded was $3.00 for copies supplied by the Department of Education. (ECF No. 353 at 7) Therefore, the undersigned finds that $4,023.83 in copying expenses are reasonable.
The Defendant makes no specific objection to the claimed expense of $1,750.00 for ESI consultants except to state that such a consultant was not necessary, and does [*9] not address the $16,275.00 in expert witness fees. The undersigned finds that these expenses were reasonable and should be awarded. Therefore, the total expense award should be $27,037.33.
III. CONCLUSION 
This Court having considered carefully the pleadings, arguments of counsel, and the applicable case law, it is hereby
RECOMMENDED that Relators' Verified Motion and Incorporated Memorandum of Law for Award of Attorneys' Fees and Costs Under 31 U.S.C. § 3730(d)(2) (ECF No. 340) be GRANTED, in part, and that attorneys fees in the amount of $60,000 and expenses in the amount of $27,037.33 be awarded to the Relators, for a total award of $87,037.33.
The parties will have 14 days from the date of being served with a copy of this Report and Recommendation within which to file written objections, if any, with The Honorable William P. Dimitrouleas, United States District Judge. Failure to file objections timely shall bar the parties from attacking on appeal factual findings contained herein. LoConte v.

ALICIA O. VALLE 
PROTECTIVE ORDER
On May 16, 2014, this Court entered an Order granting in part Defendants' Joint Motion for Protective Order. See (ECF No. 133). Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that the following provisions shall govern claims of confidentiality regarding documents the parties produce to each other or obtain from third parties via subpoena or other document requests in the above-captioned proceeding:
1. In connection with pretrial discovery proceedings in this Action, a Party providing or producing information in any [*2] form, including documents and/or all materials within the scope of Fed. R. Civ. P. 34 , ESI, tangible things, written discovery responses, answers to requests to admit, and testimony, may designate such items as "CONFIDENTIAL" or "ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY" under the terms of this Protective Order. Items or portions thereof that are so designated and the information they contain shall be:
(a) Used by the Receiving Party only for the purposes of this Action, and not for any other purpose; and
(b) Disclosed, whether oral, written, or otherwise, only to the extent permitted by this Protective Order.

2. The designation "CONFIDENTIAL" or "ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY" shall be limited to information that the designating Party reasonably believes contains:
(a) Trade secret or other confidential research, proprietary/confidential business information or materials, development, or commercial information including, but not limited to, confidential policies regarding the evaluation and assessment of loan origination and modification requests and the use of proprietary internally-developed web sites and tools for the evaluation and assessment of loan modification requests, all subject to confidential treatment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 ;
(b) Personal information of a private or sensitive matter including, but not limited to, nonpublic financial information regarding Plaintiffs or other borrowers such as documents or data containing personally identifiable financial information such as social security numbers, account numbers or loan numbers, and private information that, if disclosed, likely would cause substantial harm to a person, such as bank account statements and income tax returns, all subject to confidential treatment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 ; and/or
(c) Any other documents or information that should otherwise be subject to confidential treatment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 .

3. All "CONFIDENTIAL" or "ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY" documents and/or all materials within the scope of Fed. R. Civ. P. 34 , ESI, tangible things, written discovery responses, answers to requests to admit, and testimony, along with items or portions thereof that are so designated and the information contained in the documents and other materials:
(a) shall be disclosed, whether oral, written or otherwise, only to the extent permitted by this Protective Order;
(b) shall be used solely for the purpose of the preparation and trial of this Action;
(c) shall not be used, directly or indirectly, by any Party for any business, commercial, or competitive purpose, and
(d) no person receiving such information shall, directly or indirectly, use, transfer, disclose, or communicate in any way the information to any person other than those specified in Paragraphs 10 and 11. Any other use is prohibited.

4. All copies, excerpts, summaries, compilations, testimony, conversations, presentations, documents, or records that include, communicate, or reveal material designated "CONFIDENTIAL" or "ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY" are themselves deemed to constitute confidential matters of the same type whether or not marked or designated as such.
5. Stamping the legends "CONFIDENTIAL" or "ATTORNEYS' [*3] EYES ONLY" on the cover of any multi-page document or ESI shall designate all parts of the document or ESI as such unless otherwise stated by the Producing Party. The inadvertent failure to designate Confidential Information as "CONFIDENTIAL" or "ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY" in accordance with this Protective Order prior to or at the time of disclosure shall not operate as a waiver of the Producing Party's right to thereafter designate such information as confidential prior to trial. A preliminary production of documents or ESI made solely for the purpose of inspection and designation for copying by the Receiving Party shall not constitute a waiver of any privilege, protection, or confidentiality, even if those documents have not been marked "CONFIDENTIAL" or "ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY." If documents or ESI are produced preliminarily for the purpose of inspection and designation for copying and have not been marked "PRIVILEGED," "CONFIDENTIAL," or "ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY" before inspection by the Receiving Party, such inspection shall be made only by counsel of record for the Receiving Party and the associates, paralegals, and secretaries of said counsel who are actively engaged in assisting such counsel in this Action.
6. Any confidential information not reduced to documentary, ESI, tangible or physical form, or which otherwise cannot conveniently be designated in the manner set forth in Paragraph 1 above, shall be designated as "CONFIDENTIAL" or "ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY" by the Producing Party by informing the Receiving Party in writing that the information is confidential or subject to the attorneys' eyes only designation.
7. The Court has the ultimate authority to determine whether information or material should be designated as "CONFIDENTIAL" or "ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY" notwithstanding a Party's decision to so designate the information or material.
8. Neither the designation by a Party of any document, information, or deposition testimony as "CONFIDENTIAL" or "ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY" hereunder, nor its receipt by any other Party, shall constitute a concession that the document, information, or deposition testimony is so designated. In the event that any Party objects at any point in these proceeding to the designation of any document or information as "CONFIDENTIAL" or "ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY," the objecting Party shall provide written notice of the objection to the designating Party, specifying the materials that are the subject of the objection. The Parties shall confer in good faith in an effort to resolve the objection. If the dispute cannot be resolved, the objecting Party may seek appropriate relief from this Court, including an order that the documents or information should not be treated as "CONFIDENTIAL" or "ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY" or that specified provisions of this Protective Order shall not apply to the documents or information. The designating Party shall have the burden of proof on any such motion to establish the propriety of its confidentiality designation. Any documents in dispute shall be treated as [*4] confidential pending resolution by the Court.
9. Nothing in this Protective Order shall prevent any Party from objecting to discovery that it believes is improper.
10. Documents (and all other types of information set forth in Paragraph 2 above) designated as "CONFIDENTIAL" by the Producing Party and all information contained therein shall be kept confidential by the Receiving Party, shall be used solely for the prosecution or defense of this Action, and shall be disclosed or made available only to the Court and its staff, including court reporters, and the following persons:
(a) The Individual Parties to the Action;
(b) Counsel of Record for Plaintiffs;
(c) Counsel of Record for Defendants;
(d) In-house counsel for each Defendant responsible for supervising this Action;
(e) Partners, associates, paralegals, secretaries, and other personnel employed or retained by or working under the supervision of counsel described in Subparagraphs (a) & (b) who are actively engaged in assisting such counsel in this Action;
(f) Outside consultants, technical advisors, and expert witnesses (whether designated as trial witnesses or not), and their respective assistants and clerical staff, who are actively engaged in assisting the counsel described in Subparagraphs (a) and (b) in this Action;
(g) Persons identified on the face of the document in question as an author, addressee, or other recipient of the document;
(h) A witness at any deposition or other proceeding, or any person counsel reasonably believes may be a witness in this Action;
(i) Defendant's current and former officers, directors, in-house counsel and employees deemed necessary to aid counsel in the conduct of the above-captioned action;
(j) A witness who has or has had access to the information or who was an author or recipient of the information;
(k) Copying or imaging services or court reporters associated with or retained by a party in connection with this action;
(l) A settlement judge or mediator to whom the parties mutually agree; and
(m) Any other person or entity to whom counsel for the producer or provider of the confidential information agrees in writing, or whom the Court directs, shall have access to such information.

11. The Parties shall have the right to further designate CONFIDENTIAL documents or portions of CONFIDENTIAL documents as "ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY." Disclosure of such information shall be limited to the person designated in paragraphs 10(b), (c), (e),(f), (g), (k), (l), (m).
12. To the extent not redacted, "nonpublic personal information" and "personally identifiable financial information," as defined under 12 C.F.R. § 40.3 , 16 C.F.R. § 313.3 and/or the regulations related thereto ("Consumer Financial Privacy Laws") that can be traced to an individual, may be produced on the condition that any such documents and/or information so produced may be disclosed, if at all, only to the following categories of persons: (i) individuals identified in Paragraphs 10(b) and (c); (ii) the Court and its staff; (iii) provided that requirements of Paragraph 15 are met, the persons identified in Paragraph 10(f); (iii) persons who are the subject of the data, documents [*5] and/or information disclosed; (iv) individuals designated by the Producing Party as its Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6) witness(es); and (v) those individuals approved by this Court upon motion of any party.
13. All individuals to whom "CONFIDENTIAL" or "ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY" information is to be disclosed shall be informed of the existence of this Protective Order, shall be provided with a copy thereof, and shall be instructed that material designated pursuant to this Protective Order may not be used other than in connection with this Action and may not be disclosed to anyone other than those persons contemplated by this Protective Order. Legal counsel for the discovering Parties shall take reasonable steps to insure adherence to the terms and conditions of this Protective Order by their respective stenographic and clerical employees.
14. Material designated as "CONFIDENTIAL" or "ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY" under this Protective Order shall not be revealed to any person to whom disclosure is not permitted under Paragraphs 10 and 11, unless the Party producing the designated material assents in writing to the disclosure or unless the Court otherwise directs. If any court, arbitration, tribunal, or an administrative or government agency requests, demands, subpoenas, or orders production of material designated as "CONFIDENTIAL" or ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY" that a Party has obtained under the terms of this Protective Order, before turning over the material such Party shall promptly (not more than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt of such request, demand, subpoena, or order) notify the Party that so designated the material at issue as "CONFIDENTIAL" or "ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY" of the pendency of such request, demand, subpoena, or order, and afford a reasonable opportunity for the Party that so designated such material to oppose the request, demand, subpoena, or order and will not produce the material before the date compelled by law. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to require a party to disobey a lawful demand, subpoena or order.
15. Disclosure of documents designated as "CONFIDENTIAL" or "ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY" to the persons described in Paragraph 10(f) shall be solely for evaluation, testing, testimony, preparation for trial, or other services related to this Action. Any such person shall execute a "Non-Disclosure Agreement" in the form attached as Exhibit A hereto, stating that he or she has read and understands this Protective Order and agrees to be bound by its terms, before any "CONFIDENTIAL" or "ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY" documents are shown to that person. The original Exhibit A shall be maintained by counsel of record for the Party on whose behalf the outside consultant, technical advisor, or expert witness has been employed or retained.
16. Opposing counsel shall be notified at least fourteen (14) days before disclosure to any person described in Paragraph 10(f) who is known to be an employee or agent of, or consultant to, any competitor of the Party whose designated documents are sought to be disclosed. Such notice shall provide a reasonable description of [*6] the outside independent person to whom disclosure is sought sufficient to permit an objection to be made. If a Party objects in writing to such disclosure within fourteen (14) days after receipt of notice, no disclosure shall be made until the Party seeking disclosure obtains the prior approval of the Court or the objecting Party. This paragraph does not apply to testifying or consulting experts of the Parties provided they meet the requirements of Paragraph 15 of the Protective Order, including, but not limited to, the requirement to read and execute Exhibit A.
17. Third parties producing documents in the course of this Action may also designate information as "CONFIDENTIAL" or "ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY," subject to the same protections and constraints as the Parties to the Action. A copy of the Protective Order shall be served along with any subpoena served in connection with this Action. All documents produced by such third parties shall be treated as "CONFIDENTIAL" for a period of fourteen (14) days from the date of their production to the extent they contain material subject to the Consumer Financial Privacy Laws and/or are from a third party who owes a Party a duty of confidentiality whether through an agreement or otherwise, and during that period any Party may designate such documents as "CONFIDENTIAL" or "ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY" pursuant to the terms of the Protective Order.
18. All documents, deposition testimony, or other materials subject to this Protective Order, and all confidential information derived therefrom, shall not be used, directly or indirectly, by any Party for any business, commercial, or competitive purpose, or for any purpose whatsoever other than the preparation and trial of this Action in accordance with the provisions of this Protective Order.
19. Deposition testimony and the transcripts and video recordings of depositions conducted during pretrial discovery in this Action shall be treated as "CONFIDENTIAL" and "ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY" for a period of fifteen (15) business days, or such different number of days as the Parties may agree, after receipt of such deposition transcript and/or video recordings, to allow time for the deponent or counsel for that deponent, or any Party or its counsel, to notify all Parties of any "CONFIDENTIAL" or "ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY" matter. A Party to this Action also may designate in writing, after receipt of the deposition transcript or video recording for which the designation is made, those pages of the transcript or portions of the recording to be treated as "CONFIDENTIAL" or "ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY." A Party to this Action may also designate matter disclosed during a deposition as "CONFIDENTIAL" or "ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY" by so stating on the record during the deposition; the other Party may, but need not, object to such designation on the record. After any designation made according to the procedure set forth in this Paragraph, the designated matter shall be treated according to the designation until any dispute is resolved according to the procedures described [*7] in Paragraph 8 above. The deposition of any witness (or any portion of such deposition) that encompasses information designated "CONFIDENTIAL" or "ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY" shall be taken only in the presence of persons who are qualified to have access to such information.
20. If materials designated as "CONFIDENTIAL" or "ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY" or quotations from and/or references to such materials are to be included in papers filed with the Court, such papers shall be filed under seal pursuant to the rules of the Southern District of Florida until further order of this Court. Even if the filing party believes that the materials subject to the Protective Order are not properly classified as "CONFIDENTIAL" or "ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY" the filing party shall file such papers under seal pursuant to applicable rules; provided that the filing of any such materials under seal will not prejudice the filing party's rights to challenge the "CONFIDENTIAL" or "ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY" designation of such materials. To the extent that the Court requires leave to file "CONFIDENTIAL" or "ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY" documents or information under seal, the Parties agree to abide by such process. This Paragraph shall not apply to the Parties' submission of exhibits for trial, nor the handling of exhibits during trial. Before disclosure at trial or a hearing of materials or information designated "CONFIDENTIAL" or "ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY" the Parties may seek further protections against public disclosure from the Court for good cause shown.
21. Nothing herein shall impose any restrictions on the use or disclosure by a Party of information obtained by such Party independent of discovery in this Action, whether or not such information is also obtained through discovery in this Action, or from disclosing its own "CONFIDENTIAL" or "ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY" information as it deems appropriate except to the extent that such information includes sensitive personal or private financial information about another party. However, a Party to this Action may prospectively declare that items and information designated as "CONFIDENTIAL" or "ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY," which are in the custody of a third person/party and to be produced through discovery in this Action, are protected under this Protective Order based on a good faith belief that such material is "CONFIDENTIAL" or should be designated as "ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY" within the meaning of this Protective Order. Counsel for the Party receiving such items and information shall treat them as so designated until such time as the designating Party has had a reasonable opportunity to review and stamp the received items and information in accordance with this Protective Order.
22. The inadvertent production of any protected items or information, or items or information protected from disclosure by the attorney-client privilege, the work-product doctrine, or any other privilege or immunity available under the law, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or the local rules, shall be without prejudice to any claims [*8] that the items or information are privileged or protected, as the case may be, and shall not constitute a waiver of any privilege or protection that may otherwise attach thereto. Such production shall not be deemed a general waiver of such privilege or protection. Upon demand of the producing Party, within thirty (30) days of its discovery of such inadvertent production, all copies of any inadvertently produced items or information shall be returned immediately. Further, the voluntary production of privileged or protected items or information in itself is not a waiver of the privilege or protection, as the case may be, with respect to other privileged or protected items or information relating to the same subject matter.
23. Upon request of the Producing Party, within sixty (60) days after the final disposition of all claims and defenses in this Action, by settlement or expiration of time to appeal, all documents designated as "CONFIDENTIAL" or "ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY" and all materials produced by a Party that contain "CONFIDENTIAL" or "ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY" information, including all extracts, reproductions, and summaries of such information, shall be destroyed or returned to counsel for the producing Party or its counsel. Such destroyed or returned materials shall not include attorneys' notes or work product. Counsel of record for the Parties also shall be entitled to retain a set of all documents filed with the Court or presented at trial, related Exhibits, a full set of deposition transcripts, and all correspondence generated in connection with this Action. Counsel for each Party shall certify that the provisions of this Paragraph have been satisfied by sending opposing counsel a letter confirming compliance within the sixty (60) day period.
24. Any Party may apply to the Court for a modification of the Protective Order, and nothing in this Protective Order shall be construed to prevent a Party from seeking such further provisions enhancing or limiting confidentiality as may be appropriate.
25. The filing and entry of this Protective Order shall not constitute a waiver of any rights under any applicable law, court rules, or both. Further, no action taken pursuant to the Protective Order shall be construed as a waiver of any claim or defense in this Action or of any position as to discoverability or admissibility of evidence.
26. A material and willful violation of this Protective Order by any Party, their employees, representatives, or agents, or any third party who executes the attached Non-Disclosure Agreement, may result in irreparable harm to the Producing Party. Nothing in this Protective Order shall preclude a Party from pursuing an action for damages or injunctive relief based on the violation of the terms in this Protective Order.
27. The obligations imposed by the Protective Order shall survive the termination of this Action.

BARRY S. SELTZER, CHIEF UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE.

BARRY S. SELTZER 
ORDER ON MOTION TO COMPEL 
THIS CAUSE is before the Court on Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Defendant Bell, LLC to Produce Further Discovery and to Continue Expert Disclosure Deadlines (DE 42) and was referred to the undersigned Magistrate Judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636 and the Magistrate Rules of the Local Rules of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The matter having been fully briefed and the Court being sufficiently advised, it is hereby ORDERED that the Motion is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part as set forth below.
BACKGROUND 
Plaintiff Carlos Cabrera (individually and on behalf of all others situated) has filed a Class Action Complaint and Jury Demand (DE 1), alleging that Defendants Government Employees Insurance Company ("GEICO") and Bell, LLC ("Bell") violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act ("TCPA"), 47 U.S.C. § 227 , et seq., by making unauthorized live telephone calls and robocalls to Plaintiff and others. More specifically, Plaintiff contends that after GEICO pays claims to its customers pursuant to automobile insurance policies, it attempts to recoup the amounts paid from other drivers involved in the accident in subrogation. According to Plaintiff, when GEICO is unable to collect the funds, it contracts with collection agencies, including Defendant Bell, to contact the purported debtors in an attempt to recoup the funds. Bell, in turn, allegedly makes repeated unauthorized, unsolicited live and pre-recorded telephone calls to the third-parties, informing them that they owe subrogation payments to GEICO. Plaintiff alleges that the call recipients have not provided their telephone numbers to Defendants 1 and that they have never consented to being called by Defendants. According to Plaintiff, Defendants have placed "tens of thousands" of such calls.
The named plaintiff (Cabrera) has alleged that he was involved in an automobile accident in May 2010. Seven months later, he began receiving repeated telephone calls, from a live operator and by robocalls, to collect an alleged subrogation [*2] payment. Over the following 18 months, he allegedly received at least 20 unauthorized calls 2 on his cellular telephone from Defendants.
Plaintiff seeks to maintain this action as a class action. The Complaint defines four subclasses — a GEICO Cellular Telephone Class, a GEICO Robocall Class, a Bell Cellular Telephone Class, and a Bell Robocall Class. See Complaint § 25 (DE 1) (describing each of these sub-classes). Plaintiff has filed a Motion for Class Certification (DE 66), which Motion is pending. In that motion, however, Plaintiff seeks to certify only one class, defined as follows:
All persons in the United States to whom (1) a telephone call was placed through LiveVox that featured an artificial or prerecorded voice; (2) to a phone number provided to LiveVox by Bell LLC; (3) whose contact information was provided to Bell LLC by GEICO; and (4) who never provided Bell LLC, GEICO, or any third party acting on their behalf, prior express consent to place telephone calls to the phone number called.
Motion for Class Certification at 7 (DE 66).

Defendant GEICO has filed a Motion for Summary Judgment (DE 96), arguing, inter alia, that it did not make any telephone calls to Plaintiff using an automatic telephone dialing system or artificial or pre-recorded voice; rather, the calls were made by LiveVox, a separate entity that is not a party to this action. According to GEICO, Defendant Bell retained LiveVox and GEICO had no direction or control over the manner in which Bell conducted its collection activities. GEICO further argues that there exists no "on behalf of" or vicarious liability under the TCPA. Defendant Bell has also filed a motion to dismiss and motion for summary judgment (DE 108) raising, inter alia, similar arguments. Those motions remain pending before the District Judge.
During the course of the litigation, Plaintiff served on Defendant Bell a First Set of Requests to Admit (DE 52-1), a First Set of Interrogatories (DE 53-1), and a First Set of Requests for the Production of Documents (DE 54-1), and Defendant Bell responded thereto (DE 52-2, 53-2, 54-2, respectively). Plaintiff moves the Court to compel Defendant Bell to Produce Further Discovery (DE 42).3 More specifically, Plaintiff moves to compel Defendant Bell to produce documents responsive to 48 Requests for Production (Request for Production Nos. 3-16, 19-27, and 29-56), to provide better answers to 8 Interrogatories (Interrogatory Nos. 4-9, 11, and 13), and to provide better responses to 36 Requests for Admissions (Request for Admissions Nos. 1-8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 18, 20, 23, 25, 26, 30, 36, 43, 44, 45, 49-52, 57-64, 68, and 69). Defendant Bell has responded to the Motion (DE 58), and Plaintiff has replied thereto (DE 64). The Motion is now ripe for decision.
TIMELINESS OF MOTION 
In opposition, Defendant Bell first argues that Plaintiff's Motion to Compel should be denied because it is untimely. Local Rule 26.1(h)(1) provides that "[a]ll motions related to discovery . . . shall be filed within thirty (30) days of the occurrence of grounds for the motion. Failure to file such a discovery motion within thirty (30) days, absent a showing of reasonable cause [*3] for a later filing, may constitute a waiver of the relief sought." S.D. Fla. L. R. 26.1(h)(1). "This Rule was designed to prompt early resolution of discovery disputes and 'to ensure that discovery motions are filed when ripe and not held until shortly before the close [of] discovery or the eve of trial.'" Poe v. Carnival Corp., No. 06-20139-Civ-JORDAN-TORRES, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4627 , at *5 (S.D. Fla. Jan 23, 2007) ( Torres, M.J.) (quoting 1998 Comments, S.D. Fla. L.R. 26.1 ); see also Muzaffarr v. Ross Dress for Less, Inc., No. 12-61996-CIV-SCOLA, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 138461 , 2013 WL 5311233 , at *1 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 23, 2013) ( Snow, M.J) ("Local Rule 26.1(h)(1) reflects a policy of promoting the prompt resolution of discovery disputes by requiring the parties to timely bring to the court's attention matters that the parties cannot resolve among themselves.") (omitting internal quotation marks and citation); Manno v. Healthcare Revenue Recovery Group, LLC, No. 11-61357-CIV, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56272 , 2012 WL 1409532 , at *3 (S.D. Fla. Apr. 23, 2012) (Rosenbaum, M.J.) (Local Rule 26.1(h)(1) "sets forth a specific period within which discovery motions must be filed. Defining that period as 'thirty days' rather than . . . the less precise 'a reasonable time' reflects the judgment of the District that the filing period should not extend beyond thirty days. Thus, the Rule has the benefit of making clear precisely when discovery motions must be filed.").
"Although the 'occurrence of grounds for the motion' is usually the filing of responses and objections to a discovery request, the fact that [Local Rule 26.1.h.1] employs general language indicates that this is not always the case." Socas v. Northwestern Mut. Life Ins. Co., No. 07-20336-Civ, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16683 , 2008 WL 619322 , at *1 (S.D. Fla. Mar. 4, 2008) ( Simonton, M.J.) (finding that the date movant examined opposing party's discovery responses, which occurred nine days after receiving them, and determined responses were incomplete was the "occurrence of grounds for the motion"). As one court in this District has explained:
Depending on the particular discovery dispute, the "occurrence of grounds" for a motion to compel could be any of several acts besides service of discovery responses — e.g., a letter from counsel, an e-mail message, a phone call, or discussions during a deposition. Regardless of the specific triggering event, the key point is that once a party seeking discovery learns that the opposing party objects to providing the requested discovery the first party must seek relief from the court within thirty days or else be deemed to have waived such relief.
Manno, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56272 , 2012 WL 1409532 , at *2.

Here, Plaintiff served his discovery requests on Defendant Bell on January 4, 2013; Bell's responses thereto were due on or about February 4, 2013. At Bell's request, Plaintiff agreed to extended Bell's time for responding to March 11, 2013; Plaintiff, however, did not receive any response from Bell by that date. Plaintiff's counsel, Benjamin H. Richman, Esq., has submitted a declaration setting forth the events that ensued. Richman Decl. (DE 42-1).
According to attorney Richman, on March 12, 2013, another of Plaintiff's attorneys, Christopher L. Dore, Esq., contacted (by telephone and emails) Defendant Bell's attorney, David Hartnett, Esq. Attorney Dore was informed that Defendant Bell's responses had been mailed the previous [*4] week-end, but apparently not received by Plaintiff. Defendant Bell's attorney then attempted to email the discovery responses, but mistakenly sent Plaintiff's discovery requests instead of Bell's responses thereto. Plaintiff's attorney informed Defendant Bell's attorney of the mistake and requested that Bell's responses be sent; Bell's attorney did not respond. Id. ¶¶ 5-6. On March 15, 2013, Plaintiff's attorney (Richman) left a voicemail for Defendant Bell's attorney (Hartnett) and also spoke directly to another of Bell's attorneys, Barbara Fernandez, Esq., inquiring about the status of Bell's discovery responses; Richman was informed by Bell's attorney that she would look into the matter. On March 18, 2013, Defendant Bell's attorney (Hartnett) acknowledged the mistake in sending the discovery responses and explained that he had been ill, which had delayed the responses by one day. Later that same day, Bell's attorney (Hartnett) forwarded Bell's discovery responses to Plaintiff's counsel by email. Id. ¶¶ 7-8.
On April 15, 2013, Defendant Bell produced 79 pages of documents, consisting of a single insurance policy, a police report, and a recording of a telephone call. The next day, Plaintiff's attorney requested that Bell's attorney (Hartnett) confirm that Bell had completed its document production; attorney Hartnett did not respond. A couple of weeks later, on May 1, 2013, Defendant Bell's attorney (Hartnett) emailed Plaintiff's attorney regarding a proposed protective order for confidential information. According to Plaintiff's attorney (Richman), albeit disputed by Defendant's counsel, he understood that additional documents responsive to Plaintiff's discovery requests would be forthcoming after entry of the protective order. Despite the Court's entering the parties' proposed protective order on May 16, 2013, Defendant Bell did not produce any additional documents. Id. ¶¶ 9-10. On June 14, 2013, Plaintiff's attorney (Richman) served a "meet and confer" letter on Defendant's attorneys (Hartnett and Fernandez), outlining Plaintiff's perceived deficiencies in Defendant Bell's discovery responses and document production and requesting that the parties confer immediately as to these deficiencies. And on June 17, 2013, Plaintiff's attorney (Richman), by email, again requested that the parties confer on the outstanding discovery issues. Following several emails between the parties' respective attorneys, on June 18, 2013, Plaintiff's attorneys (Richman and Dore) and Defendant's attorneys (Hartnett and Fernandez) conferred telephonically. During that conversation, Defendant's attorney (Hartnett) indicated that he had not yet discussed with his client the alleged deficiencies, but was not inclined to provide much of the requested discovery. According to Plaintiff's attorney (Richman), however, Defendant's attorney (Hartnett) nevertheless stated that he "would look into" providing certain additional information.4 Id. ¶¶ 11-13.
Plaintiff contends that its motion to compel was timely filed because "each time the Parties engage[d] in additional [*5] discussions related to the outstanding requests and potential additional production, the time for Plaintiff to move to compel was reset and a new basis for a motion was born." Reply at 3 (DE 64) (citing Manno, 2012 WL 1409532 , at *1 n.1) ("the record reflects no intervening communications between the parties — for example, negotiations regarding further discovery responses by HRRG — that might have provided a separate 'occurrence of grounds' for Plaintiff's Motion to Compel and thereby extended the deadline for its filing"). According to Plaintiff, beginning on April 16, 2013, "the parties embarked on a series of meet and confers through telephone conferences, e-mails and other written correspondence regarding their respective views of the outstanding requests and Bell's objections thereto, as well as Bell's willingness to produce additional responsive information." Reply at 2 (DE 64). Between April 2013 and July 13, 2013, "the parties had no fewer that four conversations regarding the outstanding discovery . . ., [n]ot to mention the many e-mails and other written correspondence they exchanged regarding the same." Id. at n.1. Plaintiff represents that in all these discussions, Defendant Bell indicated that "it would review its internal investigation, objections and the documents it had produced to determine whether it was withholding any additional responsive information."  Id. at 2. On July 25, 2013, Bell did, in fact, produce additional documents "related to the unauthorized telephone calls it made to Plaintiff, including (I) internal records of the calls, and (ii) referral sheets and communications it received from GEICO with respect to Cabrera."  Id. at 3.
Defendant Bell counters that "no actions were taken by Plaintiff to address any of Defendant's objections for more than two months until counsel for the parties first had a telephone conference on the subject discovery issues in mid-June, which was couched in discussions to extend the pleading amendment cutoff and the class certification deadline." Corrected Response at 4 (DE 58). According to Defendant, all its "counsel ever agreed to do was to revisit the issue of whether there would be a production of any file related to the subrogation file Bell handled related to the telephone number Plaintiff alleges was his"; he never agreed to produce class files.  Id. at 5.
Plaintiff was less than diligent in filing its motion to compel. Plaintiff acknowledges that he received (by email) Defendant Bell's written discovery responses and objections on March 18, 2013; 30 days thereafter would have been April 17, 2013. Yet, Plaintiff waited until April 16, 2013 — one day before the date for filing a motion to compel — before attempting unsuccessfully to contact Defendant's attorney to confirm that its document production was complete. Even though Defendant's attorney did not respond to that (attempted) communication, Plaintiff did not file its motion. From a May 1, 2013 email, Plaintiff's attorney believed that Defendant would produce additional documents after the parties agreed to a protective order as to confidential [*6] information. Although Defendant still failed to produce any documents after the Court's May 16, 2013 entry of the protective order, Plaintiff's attorney waited nearly another month (until June 14, 2013) to serve on Defendant a "meet and confer" letter, outlining the perceived deficiencies in its discovery responses that it had received three months earlier. After the parties' attorney's conferred on June 18, 2013, Plaintiff waited more than another month to file the instant motion to compel.
Yet, "even if the time to file a motion to compel discovery is untimely under the [Local Rule 26.1(h)(1)], a court may excuse the untimeliness upon a showing of 'reasonable cause.'" Socas, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16683 , 2008 WL 619322 , at *1. The Court will give Plaintiff the benefit of the doubt and find that he believed from the communications between respective counsel that additional discovery would be forthcoming, given the absence of prejudice to Defendant from the untimely filing and the preference for deciding motions on their merits. See Long v. Anderson Univ., 204 F.R.D. 129 , 133 (S.D. Ind. 2001) (deciding motion to compel discovery on merits notwithstanding violations of local rules; "when a motion involves important issues which may affect the outcome of [a] case, like [a] motion to compel, the dispute is better decided on the merits than on procedural grounds.") (quoting Fisher v. Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp., 152 F.R.D. 145 , 149 (S.D. Ind. 1993)). Accordingly, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has shown "reasonable cause" for the late filing of the instant motion to compel. The Court, therefore, declines to deny the motion on timeliness grounds.
DEFENDANT BELL'S OBJECTIONS TO THE DISCOVERY REQUESTS 
Defendant has asserted identical objections to many of the individual Requests for Production, Interrogatories, and Requests for Admissions. The Court, therefore, will consider these objections together.
A. Work Product Privilege. Defendant Bell has objected to virtually all the discovery requests on what amounts to a blanket assertion of work product "immunity" or "privilege." Claims of work product protection are governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(3) , which provides in pertinent part: "Ordinarily, a party may not discover documents and tangible things that are prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial by another party or its representative (including the other party's attorney, consultant, surety, indemnitor, insurer, or agent)."5 Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(3)(A) . Work product protection "only pertain[s] to documents generated based on the anticipated probability that litigation will follow at the time the documents were drafted. Materials that were drafted in the ordinary course of business are not protected." Place St. Michel, Inc. v. Travelers Prop. Cas. Co. of Am., No. 06-21817-CIV-LENARD/TORRES, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25075 , 2007 WL 1059561 , at *2 (S.D. Fla. Apr. 4, 2007) ( Torres, M.J.) (internal citation omitted). "[I]n determining whether a document was made in anticipation of litigation, the primary focus is the reason or purpose for creating the document." Id. (quoting Guidry v. Jen Marine LLC, No. Civ. A. 03-0018, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15272 , 2003 WL 2203877 , at *2 (E.D. La. Aug. 22, 2003)).
"[T]he burden is always on the party withholding discovery to show the documents should be afforded immunity." Place St. Michel, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25075 , 2007 WL 1059561 , at *[*7] 3. "[T]he mere conclusory assertion that material sought is covered by [the]. . . work product privilege is not sufficient to render such material undiscoverable. . . . Rather, the onus is one the party claiming immunity to provide competent evidence that the materials in question were created in anticipation of litigation." Id. (internal citation omitted) (citing Auto Owners Ins. Co. v. Totaltape, Inc., 135 F.R.D. 199 , 201 (M.D. Fla. 1990)) (finding insufficient plaintiff's argument that "very nature" of documents precluded discovery). "Because all insurance investigations are likely performed with an eye towards the prospect of future litigation, it is particularly important that the party opposing production of the documents, on whom the burden of proof as to the privilege rests, demonstrate by specific and competent evidence that the documents were created in anticipation of litigation." QBE Ins. Corp. v Interstate Fire & Safety Equip., Inc. No. 3:07cv1883 (SRU), 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16406 , 2011 WL 692982 , at *3 (D. Conn. Feb. 18, 2011). "Any doubts, ambiguities, uncertainties, or silences as to the scope of the work product Rule should be resolved in favor of the Rules' overall policy of liberal discovery." Pacific Gas and Elec. Co. v. U.S., 69 Fed. Cl. 784 , 790 (Fed. Cl. 2006) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).
According to Defendant Bell,"the matters pursued by [it] were third-party subrogation claims, seeking payment from Plaintiff and the purported unidentified class members as the tortfeasor or obligor." Response at 15 (DE 58). Bell's managing director, Joel Bouvier, states that his and "Bell's understanding . . . is that these matters were referred to Bell by the GEICO claims office . . . on 'secondary placement basis' for collection as a last resort before filing a subrogation action." Bouvier Decl. ¶ 3 (DE 55-1). Defendant, therefore, argues that "litigation surrounding Plaintiff and the purported unidentified class member's [sic] was imminent from the moment the matters were assigned to Bell." Although not expressly stated, Defendant Bell appears to suggest that all documents generated by or on behalf of an insurance company relating to third-party claims are per se protected by the work product doctrine. In support, Defendant relies on the rationale articulated by a district court in the Eastern District of Michigan:
[W]hen a liability insurance insurer investigates a third party claim, the investigation is made in anticipation of claims, which, if denied, likely will lead to litigation. For this reason, it is logical to conclude that, while files generated in relation to first party claims are made in the ordinary course of business and are discoverable, files generated during the investigation of third party claims are made in anticipation of litigation and are not discoverable.
Taylor v. Temple & Cutler, 192 F.R.D. 552 , 558 (E.D. Mich. 1999) (internal citation omitted) (quoting Weitzman v. Blazing Pedals, 151 F.R.D. 125 , 125 (D. Colo. 1993)).

One court in this District, however, has rejected the argument that third-party claims are presumed to be "litigation-generating." Place St. Michel, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25075 , 2007 WL 1059561 , at *3. Although acknowledging the existence of some support for a broad application of the work product [*8] protection in the insurance context, the Place St. Michel Court characterized the approach to third-party claims (as advanced by Defendant here) as "unnecessarily simplistic and stretches the work product doctrine beyond what it was originally intended to be." Id. "Indeed, the reliance on a 'third party claim' presumption appears to be the minority view in the federal courts." Id. As noted in Place St. Michael, this wholesale approach has never been adopted by either the Eleventh Circuit or any court in this Circuit. Rather, "the majority view appears to be that a more fact-specific analysis is required." Id. (citing S.D. Warren Co. v. Eastern Elec. Corp., 201 F.R.D. 280 , 283 (D. Me. 2001)) (adopting majority rule that insurance companies are not accorded special treatment by the work product doctrine and a fact specific approach must be applied); see also CC-Aventura, Inc. v. Weitz Co., No. 06-21598, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60266 , 2008 WL 3286954 , at *1 (S.D. Fla. Aug. 7, 2008) ( O'Sullivan, M.J.) ("Although the Eleventh Circuit has not adopted a particular approach to work product issues in the insurance context, it appears the majority of courts have applied a fact-specific analysis."). Factors to be considered in a fact-specific analysis include "who prepared the documents, the nature of the documents, and the time the documents were prepared," as well as "the nature of the litigation, the relationship between the parties, and any other fact peculiar to a given case." 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25075 , [WL] at 4. Additionally, "another factor that may make a material difference is the involvement of counsel in the process, either on behalf of the claimant or the insurance company." Id. 
Here, Defendant Bell has not provided the Court with information sufficient for it to make a fact-specific analysis. Defendant's general manager provided a summary statement that Bell understood that GEICO had referred matters to it for collection as a "last resort " before filing a subrogation action. This statement, however, falls far short of satisfying Bell's burden to establish that all of its documents relating to the referrals and collection activities are protected from disclosure by the work product doctrine. Accordingly, the Court overrules Defendant's blanket assertion of work product protection.
B. Class Based Discovery 
1. Pre-certification discovery 
Defendant Bell objects to Plaintiff taking most class-based (merits) discovery before the District Court has certified a class. It contends that "it is common for courts to allow classwide discovery on the certification issue and postpone classwide discovery on the merits until after ruling on the class certification motion." Corrected Response at 12 (DE 58) (citing Washington v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 959 F.2d 1566 , 1571 (11th Cir. 1992); see also Physicians Healthsource, Inc. v. Anda, Inc., No. 12-60798-CIV, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 187644 , 2012 WL 7856269 (S.D. Fla. Nov. 27, 2012) (Rosenbaum, D.J.); Del Campo v. Kennedy, 236 F.R.D. 454 , 459 (N.D. Cal. 2006) ("Prior to certification of a class action, discovery is generally limited and in the discretion of the court."). Although Defendant is correct that courts may elect to bifurcate class-certification discovery and merits discovery, courts may also decline to exercise that discretion. [*9] See, e.g., Lakeland Reg'l Med. Ctr. v. Astellas US, LLC, No. 8:10-cv-2008-T-33TGW, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16684 , 2011 WL 486123 , at *2 (M.D. Fla. 2011) ("The Court is not persuaded that phased discovery will conserve the resources of the parties or the Court. This is because the line between 'class issues' and 'merits issues' is practically difficult, if not impossible, to determine."); Hines v. Overstock.com, Inc., No. 09-CV-991, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 70205 (E.D.N.Y. 2010) ("[C]ourts in this and other circuits have recognized that where discovery relating to class issues overlaps substantially merits discovery, bifurcation will result in duplication of efforts and needless line-drawing disputes."). Here, the District Court has chosen not to bifurcate class-certification discovery and merits discovery; instead, it has set one deadline for completion of all discovery. The undersigned, therefore, will not limit class-based discovery nor delay merits discovery until the District Court has ruled on Plaintiff's class certification motion.
2. Ascertainability of Class 
In response to virtually all Plaintiff's discovery requests seeking documents or information relating to the proposed class or Class Members, Defendant Bell objected that the requests are vague and ambiguous because it cannot determine the individuals who comprise the four subclasses identified in the Complaint — the GEICO Cellular Telephone Class, the GEICO Robocall Class, the Bell Cellular Telephone Class, and the Bell Robocall Class. Defendant contends that these groups are unascertainable without individual inquiries.6 As noted above, however, Plaintiff has narrowed the class that it now seeks to certify.7 Whether that class is sufficiently identified so that the class members are ascertainable is ultimately a question for the district court when it considers whether to certify a class. See Little v. T-Mobile USA, Inc., 691 F.3d 1302 , 1304 (11th Cir. 2012) ("Before a district court may grant a motion for class certification, a plaintiff must establish that the proposed class is adequately defined and clearly ascertainable.") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). At the discovery stage, however, the undersigned finds that the modified class Plaintiff now seeks to certify is sufficiently identifiable to permit Defendant Bell to respond to Plaintiff's discovery requests. An individual is a member of the proposed class if that individual received a telephone call placed through LiveVox with an artificial or prerecorded voice, where GEICO had provided Bell with the contact information and Bell, in turn, had provided LiveVox with the individual's telephone number, but only to the extent that the individual had not provided GEICO, Bell, or any third-party prior express consent to place the telephone call.
C. Trade Secrets 
Defendant Bell has objected to certain discovery requests on the ground that they seek proprietary information or trade secrets. This District has applied the following balancing test in determining whether information as to trade secrets is exempt from disclosure:
Under Rule 26(c)(7), there is no absolute privilege that immunizes trade [*10] secrets and similar confidential information from discovery. In order to resist discovery of such confidential information, a party must first establish that the information sought is indeed confidential and then demonstrate that its disclosure might be harmful. Once these requirements are met, the burden shifts to the other party to establish that discovery of the trade secrets or confidential information is relevant and necessary to the action. The district court then must balance the need for protection of the [confidential information] against the claim of injury resulting from disclosure. Discovery may be denied if proof of relevancy or need is not established, but if relevancy and need are shown, the trade secret should be disclosed. Determination of whether the need outweighs the harm of disclosure falls within the sound discretion of the trial court.
Empire of Carolina, Inc. v. Mackle, 108 F.R.D. 323 , 326 (S.D. Fla. 1985) (Marcus, J.).

In objecting to disclosure of such information, Defendant merely states that "Defendant's processes are proprietary processes that have independent commercial value and are not generally known. They are trade secrets." The Court does not find these summary statements sufficient to establish that the information sought is confidential or to demonstrate that its disclosure would be harmful. Moreover, upon the parties' motion, the Court has entered an order to protect disclosure of trade secrets and other confidential information. See Agreed Motion for Entry of Stipulation and Protective Order (DE 33). Accordingly, Defendant Bell's objection on this basis is overruled.
D. Confidentiality 
In additional to objecting to the disclosure of trade secrets, Defendant Bell has objected to certain discovery requests on the ground that they require disclosure of confidential information regarding persons other than Plaintiff. As noted above, the Court has entered a Protective Order that would protect disclosure of such confidential information. Accordingly, Defendant Bell's objection on this basis is also overruled.
SPECIFIC DISCOVERY REQUESTS 
Plaintiff propounded his discovery requests before he narrowed the proposed class definition in his motion for certification. Certain of his requests, therefore, seek documents and information relating to the four subclasses as defined in the Complaint. Where a Request for Production seeks documents relating to a particular subclass, the Court has substituted the term the "proposed Class" or the "proposed Class Members," as defined in Plaintiff's motion for class certification. For example, Request for Production No. 3, as propounded, seeks "ALL DOCUMENTS and ESI exchanged between YOU and GEICO RELATING TO GEICO providing YOU with the PROPOSED GEICO CLASS MEMBERS' telephone numbers." Request No. 3 shall now read: "ALL DOCUMENTS and ESI exchanged between YOU and GEICO RELATING TO GEICO providing YOU with the PROPOSED CLASS MEMBERS' (defined in Plaintiff's motion for class certification) telephone numbers." Accordingly, where the Court [*11] requires Defendant Bell to produce documents, communications, or ESI and where the Court requires Bell to answer interrogatories, Bell should construe the Court's ruling to require production of documents, communications, or ESI and interrogatory answers relating to the proposed class or class members defined in Plaintiff's motion for class certification.8 
A. Requests for Production.
1. Request Nos. 5,9 33, and 34 seek production of documents, communications and ESI pertaining to proposed Class Members giving prior express consent for Bell or for GEICO to make telephone calls to them. By definition, individuals that have consented to such calls are excluded from the proposed class. Indeed, making a telephone call with the prior express consent of the individual called is not prohibited by the TCPA. See 47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(1) . Moreover, Defendant Bell has asserted "prior express consent" as an affirmative defense. See Answer and Affirmative Defenses ¶ 60 (DE 14). The Court, therefore, finds that the documents and information sought by the Requests are relevant to the claims and defenses herein and, therefore, should be produced. Accordingly, the Motion with respect to Request Nos. 5, 33, and 34 is GRANTED. Within fourteen (14) days of the date of this Order, Defendant Bell shall produce all documents in its possession, custody, and/or control that are responsive to these requests. If Defendant does not have documents responsive to any of these Requests, it shall amend its responses to so indicate.
2. Request Nos. 9, 10, 32, 39, 40, 41, and 42 seek production of documents, communications, and ESI relating to how Defendants GEICO and Bell searched for, located, or acquired the proposed Class Members' telephone numbers. To be a member of one of the four subclasses described in the Complaint, an individual, inter alia, must have not provided Defendants, or any third party acting on their behalf, with the telephone number called by Defendants. Arguably, documents showing how Defendants obtained the telephone numbers of a proposed class member would be relevant or would lead to the discovery of admissible evidence as to whether a proposed class member had not provided Defendants with his telephone number. But, as noted above, Plaintiff now seeks to certify only one class, defined as follows:
All persons in the United States to whom (1) a telephone call was placed through LiveVox that featured an artificial or prerecorded voice [;] (2) to a phone number provided to LiveVox by Bell LLC; (3) whose contact information was provided to Bell LLC by GEICO; and (4) who never provided Bell LLC, GEICO, or any third party acting on their behalf, prior consent to place telephone calls to the phone number called.
Motion to Certify Class at 1 (DE 66). To be a member of the now proposed class, by definition, Defendant Bell must have obtained the proposed class member's telephone number from GEICO. Membership is no longer dependent on how GEICO obtained such telephone number. The undersigned, therefore, concludes that the information sought by these Requests is not relevant or likely to lead [*12] to admissible evidence with respect to the current proposed class. Accordingly, the Motion with respect to Request Nos. 9, 10, 32, 39, 40, 41, and 42 is DENIED.

3. Request Nos. 11, 12, 13, and 14 seek documents, communications, and ESI exchanged between Bell and any third party (excluding GEICO) that provided Bell with the proposed Class Member's telephone numbers. The class Plaintiff now seeks to certify includes only the contact information provided to Bell by GEICO. Information with respect to any third party providing Bell telephone numbers, therefore, is no longer relevant or likely to lead to admissible evidence. Accordingly, the Motion with respect to Request Nos. 11, 12, 13, and 14 is DENIED.
By contrast, Request Nos. 3 and 4 seek documents, communications, and ESI between Bell and GEICO pertaining to GEICO providing Bell with proposed Class Members' telephone numbers. These Requests, therefore, are relevant. Accordingly, the Motion with respect to Request Nos. 3 and 4 is GRANTED. Within fourteen (14) days of the date of this Order, Defendant Bell shall produce all documents in its possession, custody, and/or control that are responsive to these requests. If Defendant does not have documents responsive to any of these Requests, it shall amend its responses to so indicate.
4. Request No. 15 seeks production of all documents relating to Bell making subrogation related telephone calls to proposed Class Members. Request Nos. 53 and 54 seek production of all documents, communications, and ESI relating to Bell making robocalls to the proposed Class Members. The Court finds that these Requests are overbroad on their face. Accordingly, the Motion with respect to Request Nos. 15, 53, and 54 is DENIED.
5. Request No. 16 seeks production of all policies, procedure, and manuals relating to Bell making subrogation telephone calls. The Court finds that this Request is overbroad now that Plaintiff has narrowed the proposed class. The Court, therefore, will require Defendant Bell to produce only policies, procedure, and manuals relating to Bell making subrogation telephone calls using an artificial or prerecorded voice. Accordingly, within fourteen (14) days of the date of this Order, Defendant Bell shall produce all documents in its possession, custody, or control responsive to Request No. 16 as limited by the Court. If Defendant does not have documents responsive to this Request, it shall amend its response to so indicate.
6. Request Nos. 19, 20, 21, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, and 50 seek production of documents, communications, and ESI relating to Plaintiff Carlos Cabrera. In the parties' Joint Status Report, Bell represents that it has produced "all non-privileged responsive documents related to requests pertaining to communications with or about Carlos Cabrera, including the account file pertaining to Carlos Cabrera . . . and therefore, the requests that simply related to Plaintiff Cabrera have been resolved." Joint Status Report Regarding the Parties' Meet and Confer on Plaintiff's Motion to Compel at 5 (DE 101). Accordingly, the Motion with respect to Request [*13] Nos. 19, 20, 21, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, and 50 is DENIED as moot. If Defendant Bell has withheld from production documents on the basis of any privilege other than work product, it shall provide a privilege log in accordance with Local Rule 26.1(g)(3)(B) and (C).
7. Request Nos. 23, 29, and 37 seek production of documents, communications, and/or ESI relating to complaints about the telephone calls made by Bell. The Court finds that these documents are relevant or are likely to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Accordingly, the Motion with respect to Request Nos. 23, 29, and 37 is GRANTED. Within fourteen (14) days of the date of this Order, Defendant Bell shall produce all documents in its possession, custody, and/or control that are responsive to these requests. If Defendant does not have documents responsive to any of these Requests, it shall amend its responses to so indicate.
8. Request Nos. 24, 31, and 38 seek production of documents and communications relating to the telephone dialing equipment used to make the calls to the proposed Class Members, including, inter alia, those relating to the make and model of the equipment, as well as such technical information as to how telephone numbers were inputted, processed, and stored in the equipment, and the ability of the equipment to dial multiple telephone numbers simultaneously and to store or produce telephone numbers using a random or sequential number generator. The Court fails to see the relevance of the information sought. Moreover, Defendant Bell has indicated in its response that it does not have documents responsive to these Requests. See Bank of New York v. Meridien BIAO Bank Tanzania Ltd., 171 F.R.D. 135 , 152 (S.D.N.Y. 1997) ("Under ordinary circumstances, a party's good faith averment that the items sought simply do not exist, or are not in his possession, custody or control, should resolve the issue of failure of production. . . ."). Accordingly, the Motion with respect to Request Nos. 24, 31, and 38 is DENIED.
9. Request No. 25 seeks production of all documents and ESI that identify the total number of telephone calls made to the proposed Class Members.10 In response to this Request, Defendant Bell stated that "no responsive documents are believed to exist." Plaintiff questions Bell's assertion. Plaintiff first argues that Bell "undoubtedly receives compensation for the subrogation calls it places to the Proposed Class Members." Motion at 23 (DE 42). Plaintiff, however, fails to explain how the compensation Bell may have received relates to the information sought. Additionally, Plaintiff argues that Bell "must also have phone records it can provide that will show the number of telephone calls made." Id. But Plaintiff's Request seeks only documents and ESI that identify the total number of telephone calls made; it does not seek documents and ESI from which such information may be ascertained. Accordingly, the Motion with respect to Request No. 25 is DENIED.
10. Request Nos. 51 and 52 seek production of documents, communications, and ESI "sufficient to identify the total top-line revenue Bell received as the result of making [*14] phone calls on behalf of GEICO." Although Plaintiff has not proffered the purpose for seeking such information, presumably it would purportedly pertain to the issue of damages. Under the TCPA, a private plaintiff may recover (in addition to injunctive relief) his "actual monetary loss" from each violation of the statute or "$500 in damages for each such violation, whichever is greater."11 47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(3)(B) . The Complaint alleges that Plaintiff and the proposed class members have suffered actual harm because they "must frequently pay for the calls they receive or incur a usage allocation deduction from their calling plans." Complaint ¶ 3 (DE 1). The Complaint also alleges that Plaintiff and the proposed class members are entitled to statutory damages — "a minimum of $500 in damages for each violation of the TCPA." If Plaintiff and the proposed class members elect actual damages, the amount to be awarded (should Defendants be found liable) would be based on the actual harm suffered. And if Plaintiff and the proposed class members elect statutory damages, the award would be based on the number of telephone calls made to them without their prior express consent. The Court, therefore, cannot find that the "total top-line revenue" Bell received is relevant or likely to lead to admissible evidence. According the Motion with respect to Request Nos. 51 and 52 is DENIED.
B. Interrogatories.12 
1. Interrogatory No. 4 asks Defendant Bell to identify all proposed Class Members by name and for each such person, to identify his or her phone number, the source from which it obtained his or her number, the date you obtained his or her phone number, and the date(s), you made phone calls to each such person or that phone calls were made to such person on your behalf. The Motion with respect to Interrogatory No. 4 is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. Bell shall be required to identify by name the proposed Class Members and for each such Class Member give the telephone number(s) called 13 and the dates it made such calls. However, by definition, an individual is a member of the proposed class only if GEICO provided Bell with contact information; Bell, therefore, shall not be required to identify the source from which it obtained the telephone numbers. Additionally, the Court finds that the dates Bell acquired the telephone numbers is not relevant, and therefore Bell will not be required to provide this information. Within fourteen (14) days of the date of this Order, Bell shall answer Interrogatory No. 4 as limited by the Court.
2. Interrogatory No. 5 asks Bell to describe all facts surrounding its verification that the proposed Class Members consented to have their telephone numbers transferred to Bell and to have the telephone phone calls made to them. This information is relevant to Bell's affirmative defense of "prior express consent." Accordingly, the Motion with respect to Interrogatory No. 5 is GRANTED. Within fourteen (14) days of the date of this Order, Bell shall fully and completely answer Interrogatory No. 5.
3. Interrogatory No. 6 asks Defendant Bell to describe its business relationship [*15] with GEICO as it relates to the acquisition of the proposed Class Members' telephone numbers and as it relates to Bell making the telephone calls at the direction of GEICO; it also asks Bell to identify all contracts, written agreements, or any other understandings between Bell and GEICO and to describe all instructions and directives GEICO provided to Bell with respect to the telephone calls. After asserting various objection (which the Court overrules), Bell responded that it has not located any formal contract. It further responded that it receives referral sheets from GEICO and "assists in pursuit of subrogated interests." In support of his motion to compel, Plaintiff argues that Bell fails to describe any instructions or directives that GEICO provided relating to the telephone subrogation calls and that it fails to describe any informal contracts, agreements, or understandings Bell has entered into relating to the telephone calls at issue. Plaintiff contends that it is unlikely that GEICO did not provide any guidance to Bell or that Bell and GEICO did not have any business relationship beyond the referral sheets. The Court agrees that Bell has failed to provide a full and complete answer to this Interrogatory. Accordingly, the Motion with respect to Interrogatory No. 6 is GRANTED. Within fourteen (14) days of the date of this Order, Bell shall fully and completely answer Interrogatory No. 6
4. Interrogatory No. 7 asks Defendant Bell to identify all GEICO employees or agents or any other third-party who has knowledge related to the collection and transfer by GEICO to Bell of the proposed Class Members' telephone numbers. And for each such employee or agent identified, the Interrogatory requests Bell to describe the role(s) in the collections and/or transfer of the proposed Class Members' telephone number to Bell. After asserting objections (which the Court overrules), Bell responded that "Heather Bunch communicated with [it] regarding a file related to a person named Carlos Cabrera." Defendant has answered this Interrogatory only as it relates to Plaintiff; it has failed to provide any of the information requested as to the proposed Class Members. Accordingly, the Motion with respect to Interrogatory No. 7 is GRANTED. Within fourteen (14) days of the date of this Order, Bell shall fully and completely answer Interrogatory No. 7.
5. Interrogatory No. 8 asks Defendant Bell to describe all telephone dialing equipment used to make telephone calls to the proposed Class Members, including the "telephone dialing equipment utilized to record, create, and play the pre-recorded robocalls and/or artificial voice based on robocalls, the software and hardware utilized, the coded commands utilized to make the robocalls, and any automated processes that make the robocalls without human intervention." Similarly, Interrogatory No. 9 asks Bell for technical information about such telephone dialing equipment. Although Defendants (or LiveVox) may have used telephone dialing equipment to make robocalls to [*16] the Proposed Class Members, the Court does not find that technical information as to how that equipment operates is relevant or likely to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Accordingly, the Motion with respect to Interrogatory Nos. 8 and 9 is DENIED.
6. Interrogatory No. 13 asks Defendant Bell to state the total number of phone calls made to proposed Class Members. In response to this Interrogatory, Bell merely raises the same objections the Court has already overruled. And it does not address the Interrogatory in its Corrected Response to the motion to compel. Accordingly, the Motion with respect to Interrogatory No. 13 is GRANTED. Within fourteen (14) days of the date of this Order, Bell shall answer Interrogatory No. 13.
C. Requests for Admissions 
Federal Rule 36 governs requests for admissions; the Rule's purposes are "to expedite the trial and to relieve the parties of the cost of proving facts that will not be disputed at trial." Perez v. Miami-Dade County, 297 F.3d 1255 , 1268 (11th Cir. 2002) (quoting 8A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Richard L. Marcus, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2252 (2d ed. 1994)); see also Thalheim v. Eberheim, 124 F.R.D. 34 , 35 (D. Conn. 1988) ("An important purpose of the rule is to reduce the cost of litigation by narrowing the scope of disputed issues, facilitating the succinct presentation of cases to the trier of fact, and eliminating the necessity of proving undisputed facts.") (internal citations omitted). Rule 36(a) permits a party to serve on another party "a written request to admit, for purposes of the pending action only, the truth of any matters within the scope of Rule 26(b)(1) relating to: (A) facts, the application of law to fact, or opinions about either; and (B) the genuineness of any described documents." Fed. R. Civ. P. 36(a)(1) . Rule 36(a) also affords the responding party limited options for answering a request for admission:
If a matter is not admitted, the answer must specifically deny it or state in detail why the answering party cannot truthfully admit or deny it. A denial must fairly respond to the substance of the matter; and when good faith requires that a party qualify an answer or deny only a part of a matter, the answer must specify the part admitted and qualify or deny the rest. The answering party may assert lack of knowledge or information as a reason for failing to admit or deny only if the party states that it has made reasonable inquiry and that the information it knows or can readily obtain is insufficient to enable it to admit or deny.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 36(a)(4) . A responding party may also object to a request for admission, but not "solely on the ground that the request presents a genuine issue for trial." Fed. R. Civ. P. 36(a)(5) . A matter admitted under Rule 36 is deemed "conclusively established unless the court, on motion, permits the admission to be withdrawn or amended." Fed. R. Civ. P. 36(b) .

Additionally, Rule 36 expressly permits the requesting party to move a court to determine the sufficiency of an answer or objection to a request for admission. Fed. R. Civ. P. 36(a)(6) . If the court finds that an answer does not comply with the Rule, it "may order either that the matter is admitted or that an amended answer be served." Id. Where the court [*17] finds that an objection is not justified, it "must order that an answer be served." Id. 
1. Requests for Admission Relating to Plaintiff Cabrera 
Requests Nos. 1, 4, 7, 11-12, 14, 25-26, 30, and 36 seek admissions related to the individual plaintiff, Cabrera.
Request No. 1 seeks an admission that Bell made telephone calls to Plaintiff Cabrera. After asserting various objections (which the Court overrules), Bell responded: "Denied as phrased. Additionally, Defendant has made a reasonable inquiry and is without knowledge as to, and therefore cannot admit or deny at this time, whether Plaintiff is the person he alleges to be, and whether the telephone number it is alleged to have called belonged to Plaintiff." It is unclear whether the second sentence of this response is an explanation as to why Bell denied Request No. 1 "as phrased" or whether it is a separate objection to the Request.14 Additionally, the Court is uncertain precisely what Bell means by that sentence. In his reply memorandum (DE 64 at 10), Plaintiff interprets the sentence to mean that Bell contends that "it cannot admit that it made phone calls to Plaintiff because he has not yet been deposed or provided an affidavit swearing the telephone number called is his." If at the time Bell made this response (early in the discovery period), Bell, in fact, did not know whether the telephone calls it made were to Plaintiff (as opposed to whether it made calls to a specified telephone number), the Court notes that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(e)(1)(A) expressly requires that a party supplement its response to a request for admission if it subsequently learns that the response is "inaccurate or incomplete."
In support of his motion to compel, Plaintiff contends that "[d]espite Plaintiff's production of the phone recording with Plaintiff Cabrera in which the Bell representative admits that Bell called Plaintiff, Bell denies making phone calls to Plaintiff."15 Plaintiff argues that "[w]ithout question Defendant is being untruthful" and that the Court, therefore, "should compel an accurate response."
Request No. 4 seeks an admission that GEICO instructed Bell to make telephone calls to Plaintiff. Request No. 7 seeks an admission that Bell made telephone calls to Plaintiff on behalf of GEICO. And Request No. 14 seeks an admission that Bell made robocalls to Plaintiff on behalf of GEICO. After asserting various objections (which the Court overrules), Bell responded: "Subject to and without waiver of these objections and upon a reasonable inquiry, Defendant denies the request as phrased" (Nos. 4 and 7) or "Subject to and without waiver of these objections and upon a reasonable inquiry, the request is Denied" (No. 14). In support of his motion to compel, Plaintiff contends that Bell's denials to these Requests are "wholly inaccurate at best" because Bell admits in Interrogatory No. 6 that it makes calls based on referral sheets provided by GEICO and because Bell produced a police report it received with Cabrera's telephone number. Plaintiff argues, therefore, that the Court should compel Bell to "accurately respond."
Request No. 11 and No. 12 seek admissions [*18] that Plaintiff did not give prior express consent for Bell or for GEICO, respectively, to make telephone calls to him on his cellular telephone. After asserting various objections (which the Court overrules) Bell denied the Requests "as phrased." Bell additionally stated that it had made "a reasonable inquiry and is without knowledge as to, and therefore cannot admit or deny at this time, whether Plaintiff is the person he alleges to be, and whether the telephone number it is alleged to call belonged to Plaintiff." In support of his motion to compel, after noting that Bell has asserted an affirmative defense of "prior express consent," Plaintiff contends that "[i]f Bell actually obtained consent, it should have documentation and should be required to produce it."16 
Request No. 25 and No. 26 seek admissions that Plaintiff did not provide Bell or GEICO, respectively, with his telephone number. After asserting objections (which the Court overrules), Bell responded to each: "Subject to and without waiver of the foregoing objections, the request is Denied." In support of his motion to compel, Plaintiff contends that "[d]espite Bell's production of the police report from which it obtained Plaintiff's telephone number, Bell denies that Plaintiff provided it himself based on its inability to discern whether Plaintiff is who he claims to be." Plaintiff argues that "[i]f Plaintiff Cabrera did in fact provide Bell [or GEICO] his telephone number, Bell should have documentation of that disclosure" and, therefore, the Court should compel Bell to "respond truthfully" to these Requests.
Request No. 30 and No. 36 seek admissions that Bell and GEICO, respectively, acquired Plaintiff's telephone number from a police report. After asserting objections (which the Court overrules), Bell responded to each of these Requests: "Subject to and without waiver of the foregoing objections, the request is Denied." In support of his motion to compel, Plaintiff argues that "[u]nless Bell obtained Plaintiff's phone number from somewhere other than the police report it produced to Plaintiff" or "[u]nless GEICO provided some other source of acquisition of Cabrera's phone number in its referral to Bell," Bell should have admitted these Requests, and therefore, the Court should compel Bell to "respond truthfully" to them.
Plaintiff, in essence, is requesting that the Court ascertain the veracity of each of Defendant's answers to the Requests for Admission. In determining the sufficiency of a answer to a request for admission, however, the court's role is to "ensure the formalities of [Rule 36(a)] are observed. As long as a responding party's answer is adequate to satisfy the technical requirements of Rule 36, the court is not empowered to compel [the responding party] to change an answer to conform to the 'truth' or to any particular theory or other evidence. . . ." Collins v. JC Penney Life Ins. Co., No. 02cv0674-L(LAB), 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8455 , at *32 (S.D. Cal. May 5, 2003). As one court recently explained: "The Federal Rules provide two avenues for challenging a party's answers to a request for admission. Rule 36(a), which addresses the [*19] form of the answer, and Rule 37(c)(2),17 which addresses the answer's factual accuracy." Point Blank Solutions, Inc. v. Toyobo America, Inc., No. 09-61166-CIV, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25046 , 2011 WL 742657 , *at 2 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 24, 2011) ( Goodman, M.J.) (emphasis in original). The Point Blank Court ruled that Rule 36(a)(6) "clearly speaks to the form of the answer or objection, not to its substance"; the Rule "does not authorize a Court to inquire into the substantive accuracy of the denial" before trial or before summary judgment has been granted to either party. See also Dowdy v. Coleman Co., Inc., No. 1:11-cv-00045-DAK-EJF, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 160536 , 2012 WL 5450039 (D. Utah Nov. 7, 2012) ("Rule 36(a) does not authorize a Court to prospectively render determinations concerning the accuracy of a denial to a Request for Admission, or to order that the subject matter of the request be admitted because the opposing party's unequivocal denial is asserted to be unsupported by the evidence. If Defendant Bell's responses to these Requests for Admission prove to be false, then Defendant has a remedy under Rule 37(c)(2). Accordingly, the Motion with respect to Request for Admission Nos. 1, 4, 7, 11-12, 14, 25-26, 30, and 36 is DENIED. However, if Defendant Bell determines that it is required under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(e)(1)(A) to supplement its answers to any of these Requests, it shall do so within ten (10) days of the date of this Order.
2. Requests for Admission Relating to Proposed Class Members 
Requests Nos. 2-3, 5-6, 8, 15, 18, 20, 23, 43-45, 49-52, 57-64, and 68-69 seek admissions relating to the 4 proposed subclasses defined in the Complaint. After carefully reviewing each of these Requests for Admissions, the Court concludes that, unlike the Requests for Production, they do not lend themselves to revision to comport with the current proposed class. Moreover, after asserting various objections (which the Court has overruled above), Defendant Bell has "subject to and without waiver" of the objections either denied the Requests for Admissions (Nos. 2, 15, 18, 20, 23, 43-45, 49-52, 57-64, and 68-69), denied them "as phrased" (Nos. 5-6, and 8) or stated that "upon a reasonable inquiry, Defendant is without knowledge and therefore cannot admit or deny this request" (No. 3). These responses comport with the (technical) requirements of Rule 36(a)(4). Defendant Bell, therefore, provided procedurally sufficient answers to the Requests at issue (as they relate to the 4 subclasses). Accordingly, the Motion with respect to Requests for Admission Nos. 2-3, 5-6, 8, 15, 18, 20, 23, 43-45, 49-52, 57-64, and 68-69 is DENIED.
DONE AND ORDERED in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, this 3rd day of July 2014.

Plaintiff alleges that Defendants obtain the telephone numbers through various means, including from police reports from the auto accident underlying the insurance claims, from the call recipient's insurance carrier, or through a process known as "skip tracing."

In a subsequent filing, Plaintiff's counsel indicates that by June 2012 Plaintiff had received from Defendants unauthorized telephone calls "numbering in the hundreds." Richman Decl. ¶ 8 (DE 64-1).

Plaintiff has also moved the Court to continue the expert disclosure deadlines. The undersigned hereby DENIES without prejudice that portion of the Motion, as the District Judge set the expert disclosure deadlines. The parties' joint motion to continue all pretrial deadlines, including the expert disclosure deadlines, is currently pending before the District Judge.

In his declaration, attorney Richman specifically identifies attorney Hartnett's representations as to this information. Id. ¶ 13.

Such documents and tangible things may be discovered if they come within the scope of Federal Rule 26(b)(1) and the requesting party "shows that it has substantial need for the materials to prepare its case and cannot, without undue hardship, obtain their substantial equivalent by other means." Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(3)(A)(i) and (ii). Plaintiff here has made no such showing.

fn

In response to Plaintiff's discovery requests, Defendant Bell objected to certain definitions Plaintiff included therewith. In its response to the instant motion to compel, Bell requests that the court consider these objections because "they lead to the inescapable conclusion that Plaintiff has sought discovery of unascertainable and ill-defined groups." Corrected Response at 6 (DE 58). The Court has considered Defendant's objections and finds them to be without merit.

fn

Defendant Bell argues that Plaintiff is bound by the proposed classes identified in the Complaint and that Plaintiff may not revise such classes without a formal amendment of the Complaint, citing Vega v. T-Mobile USA, Inc., 564 F.3d 1256 (11th Cir. 2009). The Vega Court, however, did not establish a per se rule against a plaintiff modifying a class from that initially identified when it moves for certification. Indeed, the Eleventh Circuit has recognized that "the scope and contour of a class may change radically as discovery progresses and more information is gathered about the nature of the putative class members' claims." Prado-Steinman ex rel Prado v. Bush, 221 F.3d 1266 , 1273 (11th Cir. 2000); see also Pop's Pancakes, Inc. v. NuCO2, Inc., 251 F.R.D. 677 , 680 n.1 (S.D. Fla. 2008) ( Middlebrooks, D.J.) (court analyzed Rule 23 pre-requisites as to the classes proposed in motion for class certification, which differed from the class defined in complaint).

fn

Before considering the specific discovery requests, the Court notes that Defendant Bell has stated that the files it "receives from GEICO claims office may relate to at least four 'GEICO' entities, three of which are not the named Defendant." Bouvier Decl. ¶ 11 (DE 55-1). Bell contends that "when [it] receives a file from the GICO claims office, [it] does not know which of the GEICO entities are the insurer." Id. ¶ 11. When responding to the discovery requests, however, if Bell is unable to ascertain whether it has responsive documents or information pertaining to Defendant "Government Employees Insurance Company," it shall provide the documents and information as to all GEICO entities.

fn

Request Nos. 5, 6, 7, and 8, as propounded, seek the same documents for each of the 4 subclasses identified in the Complaint. As the Court has limited discovery requests to the one proposed class identified in its motion for class certification, Requests 6, 7, and 8 are DENIED as moot.

fn 
10
Request Nos. 25, 26, 27, and 28, as propounded, seek the same documents for each of the 4 subclasses identified in the Complaint. As the Court has limited discovery requests to the one proposed class identified in its motion for class certification, Requests 26, 27, and 28 are DENIED as moot.

fn 
11
If the court finds that a defendant willfully and knowingly violated the TCPA, it may treble the damages awarded. 47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(3)(C) .

fn 
12
In addition to various objections (that the Court has overruled), for each interrogatory at issue, Defendant states that "calls were not made as alleged to be related to the defined terms and putative class[ ]." The Court does not know what Defendant means by this objection, and Defendant does not explain further. The Court, therefore, has not considered this objection in ruling on the interrogatories.

fn 
13
Interrogatory No. 11 also asks Bell to identify the telephone numbers used to call proposed Class Members. As the same information is requested by Interrogatory No. 4, Interrogatory No. 11 is DENIED as moot.

fn 
14
Defendant Bell has responded similarly to each of the requests for admissions at issue relating solely to Plaintiff Carbrera.

fn 
15
Plaintiff's counsel attests that "Bell's own documents show that it received a call from Plaintiff in June 2012 (which it recorded) using the cellular telephone at issue, at which time Carbrera confirmed his identity and requested that the unauthoriced calls — numbering in the hundreds at that point — be stopped." Richman Decl. ¶ 8 (DE 64-1).

fn 
16
Because this is a request for admission, not a request for production, the Court assumes that Plaintiff actually meant that Bell should be required to admit Request Nos. 11 and 12, unless it has documentation showing such prior express consent.

fn 
17
Rule 37(c)(2) provides that "if a party fails to admit a request under Rule 36, and if the requesting party later proves a document to be genuine or the matter true," a court must award the requesting party "its reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred in making that proof," unless certain enumerated conditions exist.

MONTE C. RICHARDSON, UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE.

MONTE C. RICHARDSON 
MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER1 
THIS CAUSE is before the Court on Plaintiff's appeal of an administrative decision denying her application for a period of disability and Disability Insurance Benefits. Plaintiff alleges she became disabled on November 11, 2009. (Tr. 297.) Plaintiff's claim was denied initially and on reconsideration. (Tr. 115-17, 119-20.) After a hearing (Tr. 40-65), the assigned Administrative Law Judge ("ALJ") found that Plaintiff was not disabled. (Tr. 94-103.) Plaintiff requested review of the ALJ's decision. (Tr. 177-78.) The Appeals Council remanded the case to the ALJ for further proceedings. (Tr. 109-10.) The ALJ held another hearing on September 4, 2013, at which Plaintiff was represented by an attorney. (Tr. 66-88.) The ALJ found Plaintiff not disabled from November 11, 2009, the alleged onset date, through December 31, 2010, the date last insured. (Tr. 21-34.)
In reaching the decision, the ALJ found that Plaintiff had severe impairments, including disorders of the spine, Budd-Chiari syndrome, and history of Meniere's disease. (Tr. 23.) The ALJ also found that Plaintiff had the residual functional capacity ("RFC") to perform light work with limitations. (Tr. 25.)
Plaintiff is appealing the Commissioner's decision that she was not disabled from November 11, 2009 through December 31, 2013. Plaintiff has exhausted her available administrative remedies and the case is properly before the Court. The undersigned has reviewed the record, the briefs, and the applicable law. For the reasons stated herein, the Commissioner's decision is REVERSED and REMANDED.
I. Standard of Review 
The scope of this Court's review is limited to determining whether the Commissioner applied the correct legal standards, McRoberts v. Bowen, 841 F.2d 1077 , 1080 (11th Cir. 1988), and whether the Commissioner's findings are supported by substantial evidence, Richardson v. Perales, 402 U.S. 389 , 390 , 91 S. Ct. 1420 , 28 L. Ed. 2d 842 (1971). "Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion." Crawford v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec., 363 F.3d 1155 , 1158 (11th Cir. 2004). Where the Commissioner's decision is supported by substantial evidence, the district court will affirm, even if the reviewer would have reached a contrary result as finder of fact, and even if the reviewer finds that the evidence preponderates against the Commissioner's decision. Edwards v. Sullivan, 937 F.2d 580 , 584 n.3 (11th Cir. 1991); Barnes v. Sullivan, 932 F.2d 1356 , 1358 (11th Cir. 1991). The district court must view the evidence as a whole, taking into account evidence favorable as well as unfavorable [*2] to the decision. Foote v. Chater, 67 F.3d 1553 , 1560 (11th Cir. 1995); accord Lowery v. Sullivan, 979 F.2d 835 , 837 (11th Cir. 1992) (stating the court must scrutinize the entire record to determine the reasonableness of the Commissioner's factual findings).
II. Discussion 
Plaintiff raises three general issues on appeal. Plaintiff argues that the ALJ failed to articulate good cause for discounting the opinions of Plaintiff's treating physician, Robert Valentine, Jr., M.D. Plaintiff also argues that the ALJ erred in failing to properly consider the opinions of examining physician, Lily Rocha, M.D. Finally, Plaintiff contends that the ALJ failed to articulate good cause for discounting the opinions of Plaintiff's treating physician, Michele St. Martin, M.D. Defendant responds the ALJ's evaluation of the medical opinions of record is clearly articulated and supported by substantial evidence.
A. Standard for Evaluating Opinion Evidence 
The ALJ is required to consider all the evidence in the record when making a disability determination. See 20 C.F.R. § 404.1520(a)(3) . With regard to medical opinion evidence, "the ALJ must state with particularity the weight given to different medical opinions and the reasons therefor." Winschel v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec., 631 F.3d 1176 , 1179 (11th Cir. 2011). Substantial weight must be given to a treating physician's opinion unless there is good cause to do otherwise. See Lewis v. Callahan, 125 F.3d 1436 , 1440 (11th Cir. 1997).
"'[G]ood cause' exists when the: (1) treating physician's opinion was not bolstered by the evidence; (2) evidence supported a contrary finding; or (3) treating physician's opinion was conclusory or inconsistent with the doctor's own medical records." Phillips v. Barnhart, 357 F.3d 1232 , 1240-41 (11th Cir. 2004). When a treating physician's opinion does not warrant controlling weight, the ALJ must nevertheless weigh the medical opinion based on: (1) the length of the treatment relationship and the frequency of examination, (2) the nature and extent of the treatment relationship, (3) the medical evidence supporting the opinion, (4) consistency of the medical opinion with the record as a whole, (5) specialization in the medical issues at issue, and (6) any other factors that tend to support or contradict the opinion. 20 C.F.R. § 404.1527(c)(2)-(6) .
Although a treating physician's opinion is generally entitled to more weight than a consulting physician's opinion, see Wilson v. Heckler, 734 F.2d 513 , 518 (11th Cir. 1984) (per curiam); 20 C.F.R. § 404.1527(c)(2) , "[t]he opinions of state agency physicians" can outweigh the contrary opinion of a treating physician if "that opinion has been properly discounted." Cooper v. Astrue, [2008 BL 48618], 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 117495 , [2008 BL 48618], 2008 WL 649244 at *3 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 10, 2008). Further, "the ALJ may reject any medical opinion if the evidence supports a contrary finding." Wainwright v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec. Admin., Case No.: 06-15638, [2007 BL 230979], 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 5698 , [2007 BL 230979], 2007 WL 708971 at *2 (11th Cir. Mar. 9, 2007) (per curiam); see also Sryock v. Heckler, 764 F.2d 834 , 835 (11th Cir. 1985) (per curiam) (same).
"The ALJ is required to consider the opinions of non-examining state agency medical and psychological consultants because they 'are highly qualified physicians and psychologists, who are also experts in Social Security disability evaluation.'" Milner v. Barnhart, 275 F. App'x 947 , 948 (11th Cir. May 2, 2008) (per curiam); see alsoSSR 96-6p, 1996 SSR LEXIS 3 (stating [*3] that the ALJ must treat the findings of State agency medical consultants as expert opinion evidence of non-examining sources). While the ALJ is not bound by the findings of non-examining physicians, the ALJ may not ignore these opinions and must explain the weight given to them in his decision. SSR 96-6p, 1996 SSR LEXIS 3 .
B. The ALJ's Decision 
The ALJ found that Plaintiff had severe impairments, including disorders of the spine, Budd-Chiari syndrome, and history of Meniere's disease. However, the ALJ found that "[t]hrough the date last insured (12/31/2010) the claimant did not have any impairment or combination of impairments that met or medically equaled the severity of one of the listed impairments in 20 CFR Part 404 , Subpart P, Appendix 1 ( 20 CFR 404.1520(d) , 404.1525 and 404.1536 )." (Tr. 25.)
The ALJ then made the following RFC determination:
[Plaintiff] had the [RFC] to perform light work as defined in 20 CFR 404.1567(b) except with no more than occasional climbing of ramps and stairs, balancing, stooping, kneeling, crouching, and crawling; no climbing of ladders, ropes, or scaffolds; no concentrated exposure to hazards (machinery, heights, etc.); avoid even moderate exposure to noise and vibrations; no more than simple, routine, repetitive tasks due to pain; and needs to change positions between sitting/standing at will.
( Id.)

In making this finding, the ALJ gave "no significant weight" to Dr. Valentine's treating opinions regarding Plaintiff's spine limitations. (Tr. 19.) The ALJ stated:
I have considered the opinion of Dr. Valentine and give it no significant weight. I note that Dr. Valentine has a treatment history with the claimant; however, his opinion is not supported by his own treatment records, which show pain resolved with epidural steroid injections. Furthermore, in May of 2009, the claimant did not consider herself disabled due to pain. I note that post DLI treatment records document continued complaints of pain; however, clinical findings were normal, including normal strength and straight leg test. The mere existence of some pain, even chronically, does not require a finding that the claimant cannot work and the fact that working may cause pain and discomfort does not mandate a finding of disability. While the claimant's complaints of pain have some basis in objective findings, the evidence fails to establish that the level of pain precludes all levels of functioning.
(Tr. 31) (internal citations omitted.) The ALJ also gave the opinions of Dr. Rocha "some weight" and explained as follows:
I have considered the opinion of Dr. Rocha and give it some weight. I note that Dr. Rocha's opinion is fairly consistent with the assessed/established RFC and is supported by mostly normal clinical findings; however, this examination was performed and the opinion was given after the claimant's date last insured . . . Furthermore, I give no significant weight to the examination or opinion performed in August of 2013, which is 2 years, 8 months after the claimant's date last insured (DLI). It is also emphasized that the claimant underwent the examinations that formed the basis of the opinions in question not in an attempt to seek treatment [*4] for symptoms, but rather, through attorney referral and in connection with an effort to generate evidence for the current appeal. Further, the doctor was presumably paid for the report. Although such evidence is certainly legitimate and deserves due consideration, the context in which it was produced cannot be entirely ignored.
( Id) (internal citations omitted.) Finally, the ALJ gave the opinions of Dr. St. Martin "no weight based on res judicata." ( Id.)

C. Analysis 
Plaintiff's first argument is that the ALJ failed to articulate sufficient good cause to discount the opinions of Dr. Valentine. The undersigned agrees.
Dr. Valentine completed a detailed, handwritten RFC Questionnaire on August 12, 2011. (Tr. 581-85.) In the report, Dr. Valentine diagnosed Plaintiff with low back pain, muscle spasms, Chiari malformation, disc displacement in her lumbar spine, and lumbar radiculitis, causing low back pain radiating to Plaintiff's right leg, as well as neck and shoulder pain. (Tr. 581.) Dr. Valentine cited objective findings for the diagnoses, including limited range of lumbar motion, variable spasms, L3-4 annular fissure, and L5-S1 disc herniation. ( Id.) Dr. Valentine opined that the pain Plaintiff experiences would frequently be severe enough to interfere with her attention and concentration needed to perform even simple tasks. (Tr. 582.) He further opined that Plaintiff could only sit for thirty minutes before needing to stand up and could only stand for thirty minutes before needing to sit down or walk around. ( Id.) Dr. Valentine opined that Plaintiff could only stand/walk for about two hours in an eight hour workday. (Tr. 583.) Ultimately, Dr. Valentine assigned lifting and neck limitations, stated that Plaintiff's impairments would produce good and bad days, and opined that she would likely be absent from work approximately four (4) days per month as a result of her impairments. (Tr. 583-84.) Dr. Valentine stated that the limitations applied as of November 2009. (Tr. 585.) On August 23, 2013, Dr. Valentine prepared a follow-up report on Plaintiff's limitations. He stated that the "limitations are unchanged as of 4/9/2012," and affirmed that the limitations applied as of November 2009. (Tr. 603.)
The undersigned agrees with Plaintiff that the ALJ failed to sufficiently articulate good cause for rejecting the opinions of Dr. Valentine. First, the ALJ stated that Dr. Valentine's opinions were inconsistent with his treating notes because they show that "pain resolved with epidural steroid injections." (Tr. 31.)
When viewed in context, however, the treatment notes do not show that Plaintiff's pain "resolved" with ESI. In fact, the most recent ESI, performed in December 2010 via the caudal approach, apparently failed to resolve Plaintiff's pain. (Tr. 570.) Dr. Valentine also specifically noted that Plaintiff's pain returned after the transforaminal ESI conducted on May 14, 2009. (Tr. 574-75 ("[Plaintiff] reports several weeks of excellent relief from her previous L5 transforaminal injection, but the pain ret'd." (emphasis added).) Dr. Valentine reported Plaintiff's pre-injection pain at [*5] 5/10 and post-injection pain at 7/10 during a transforaminal ESI conducted on January 21, 2010. (Tr. 573.) Notably, Dr. Valentine continued to treat Plaintiff for continued pain through April 2012, reflecting multiple ineffective treatment sources, and frequently adjusting medications. (See Tr. 562, 564, 567, 569, 570, 595, 597, 599, 601 (noting "Failed analgesics, anti-inflammatory, physical therapy, exercise, 12/10 caudal ESI, salsalate," and change of various medications due to ineffectiveness).) It appears the ALJ found an "inconsistency" between Dr. Valentine's opinions and his treatment records by "cherry-picking" an out of context statement that "pain resolved" from Dr. Valentine's progress notes. (See, e.g., Tr. 562.) However, it is clear than an "ALJ is obligated to consider all relevant medical evidence and may not cherrypick facts to support a finding of non-disability while ignoring evidence that points to a disability finding."2 Goble v. Astrue, 385 F. App'x 588 , 593 (7th Cir. 2010) (citing Myles v. Astrue, 582 F.3d 672 , 678 (7th Cir. 2009)).
The ALJ also discredited Dr. Valentine's opinions because "in May of 2009, [Plaintiff] did not consider herself disabled due to pain." (Tr. 31.) The ALJ references the "History" section of a printed treatment note from May 14, 2009, whereupon the word "No" is listed next to the question "Considers self disabled by pain?" (Tr. 576.) The ALJ's reasoning in this regard is insufficient.
First, it is unclear how Plaintiff's own view of her disability status in May of 2009 is inconsistent with Dr. Valentine's opinions that applied as of November of 2009. Similarly, Plaintiff's statement regarding her disability status was made prior to her alleged onset date of November 11, 2009. Second, without further information, it is impossible to determine whether Plaintiff understood and utilized the same definition of disability contemplated by Dr. Valentine and the Social Security Administration. Accordingly, Plaintiff's statement regarding her disability status in May of 2009 does not constitute good cause for discounting Dr. Valentine's opinions.
In light of this conclusion and the possible change in the RFC assessment, the Court also finds it unnecessary to address whether the ALJ erred in analyzing the opinions of Drs. Rocha and St. Martin. See Jackson v. Bowen, 801 F.2d 1291 , 1294 n.2 (11th Cir. 1986) (per curiam); Freese v. Astrue, [2008 BL 82151], 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32258 , [2008 BL 82151], 2008 WL 1777722 , at *3 (M.D. Fla. Apr. 18, 2008); see also Demenech v. Sec'y of the Dep't of Health & Human Servs., 913 F.2d 882 , 884 (11th Cir. 1990) (per curiam). The ALJ will nevertheless be directed to re-consider the opinions of Drs. Rocha and St. Martin on remand.
Accordingly, it is ORDERED:
1. The Commissioner's decision is REVERSED pursuant to sentence four of 42 U.S.C. § 405(g) and REMANDED with instructions to the ALJ to: (a) reconsider the opinions of Drs. Valentine, Rocha, and St. Martin, explain what weight they are being accorded, and the reasons therefor; (b) reconsider the RFC assessment, if necessary, and (c) conduct any further proceedings deemed appropriate.
2. The Clerk of Court is directed to enter judgment consistent with this Order and close the file.
3. Plaintiff's counsel is advised that, in the event benefits are awarded on remand, any § 406(b)[*6] or § 1383(d)(2) fee application shall be filed within the parameters set forth by the Order entered in Case No.: 6:12-124-Orl-22 (In re: Procedures for Applying for Attorney's Fees Under 42 U.S.C. §§ 406(b) & 1383(d)(2) ). This Order does not extend the time limits for filing a motion for attorney's fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2412 .
DONE AND ORDERED at Jacksonville, Florida, on September 16, 2016.

It is also noteworthy that the ALJ did not discuss Dr. Scott's treatment of Plaintiff in conjunction with Dr. Valentine. Dr. Scott examined Plaintiff in August 2009 and, like Dr. Valentine, noted that Plaintiff's "first lumbar ESI did give her three weeks of relief, however, the second injection did not give her any relief." Dr. Scott then referred Plaintiff to physical therapy and stated that "if [Plaintiff] does not improve she will return to see [him] and discuss further surgical options." (Tr. 456.) On October 19, 2009, Dr. Scott examined Plaintiff and noted that she "finds the massage to be helpful but the other modalities have not improved her symptoms." (Tr. 455.)

ANTHONY E. PORCELLI 
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
This cause comes before the Court after the undersigned filed a Report and Recommendation regarding Defendants'1 entitlement to costs. (Dkt. No. 142.) In the Report and Recommendation, the undersigned recommended that Defendants' costs be awarded with the exception of those costs that Defendants conceded were not taxable, with costs totaling $11,275.75. ( Id.) Plaintiffs then timely filed an Objection to the Report and Recommendation, which raised a new issue regarding electronic discovery costs. (Dkt No. 145.) In their Objection, Plaintiffs only objected to the charges attributed to electronic discovery, which totaled $9,775.00.2 (Dkt. No. 145 at 3.) The District Judge subsequently remanded the Report and Recommendation to the undersigned for reconsideration of the costs award in light of Plaintiffs' Objection.3 (Dkt. No. 146.)
On February 6, 2013, after Defendants filed a Response (Dkt. No. 148) in opposition of Plaintiffs' Objection, the undersigned held a hearing on the matter. At the hearing, the undersigned directed the parties to meet and confer regarding the disputed amount of electronic discovery costs and instructed Defendants to either file a supplemental response or a notice of settlement as to the amount of costs, if in fact, the parties reached an agreement. On February 15, 2013, Defendants filed a Notice indicating that the parties agreed [*2] to settle the disputed amount of $9,775.00 discussed in the Objection. (Dkt. No. 152 at 1.) In addition to the $1,500.75 of undisputed costs, the parties agreed that Defendants would also be entitled to $1,000.00 in taxable costs from Plaintiffs as to the disputed amount. ( Id. at 2.) Accordingly, the parties agreed that Defendants are entitled to a total of $2,500.75 in taxable costs. As such, the undersigned recommends that Defendants be awarded $2,500.75 in taxable costs.
Accordingly, and for the foregoing reasons, it is hereby RECOMMENDED that:
(1) Defendants' Bill of Costs (Dkt. No. 128) be GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART, to the extent that $2,500.75 in costs be awarded in favor of Defendants and against Plaintiffs.

IT IS SO REPORTED in Tampa, Florida on this 21st day of February, 2013.

SUSAN C. BUCKLEW, United States District Judge.

SUSAN C. BUCKLEW 
ORDER
This cause comes before the Court on two motions: (1) Millennium's motion to stay enforcement of costs or to amend the magistrate judge's cost determination (Doc. No. 696), which Ameritox opposes (Doc. No. 700); and (2) Millennium's Motion for a Temporary Stay (Doc. No. 697), which Ameritox opposes (Doc. No. 702). Accordingly, the Court will address each motion.
I. Background
Ameritox and Millennium are clinical laboratories that screen urine specimens for the presence of drugs. They are competitors in the industry and have been engaged in extensive litigation for several years.
Ameritox asserted six claims against Millennium that went to trial:1 (1) violation of Florida's Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (Counts II and III), (2) unfair competition under California law (Count IV), (3) violation of the New Hampshire Consumer Protection Act (Count V), (4) common law tortious interference with business relationships in Arizona, Florida, California, New Hampshire, Tennessee, and Texas (Count VI), and (5) common law unfair competition in Arizona, Florida, New Hampshire, and Texas (Count VII).2 (Doc. No. 429). The jury found in favor of Ameritox on the following claims: (1) common law tortious interference with business relationships in Florida, Tennessee, and Texas (Count VI), and (2) common law unfair competition in Florida and Texas (Count VII). (Doc. No. 620). The jury or the Court found in favor of Millennium on all of Ameritox's other claims, including the claims of common law tortious interference with business relationships in Arizona, California, and New Hampshire, as well as [*2] the claims of common law unfair competition in Arizona and New Hampshire.3 (Doc. No. 620, 667).
Ameritox's unfair competition and tortious interference claims were based, in a large part, on the theory that Millennium unlawfully obtained referrals through: (1) the provision of free POCT cups under cup agreements, (2) the facilitation of below-market-value prices for chemical analyzers and supplies from third-parties, and (3) the provision of free billing advice. The jury rejected Ameritox's contention that Millennium engaged in unfair competition and tortious interference by facilitating below-market-value prices for chemical analyzers and supplies from third-parties and by providing free billing advice. (Doc. No. 620). The jury found in favor of Ameritox on Ameritox's contention that Millennium violated the Anti-Kickback Statute ("AKS") and Stark Law by providing free POCT cups under cup agreements in exchange for referrals. (Doc. No. 620).
At trial, Ameritox presented evidence that Millennium created its free cup program as a means by which it could provide something of value to its customers in order to induce referrals. The free cup program consisted of Millennium entering into cup agreements with customers, under which Millennium provided the customers with free POCT cups that the doctors used to collect urine specimens and that had to be returned to Millennium for confirmatory testing. Pursuant to the terms of the cup agreements, the doctors had to agree not to bill patients for the immediate POC testing results that the free POCT cups provided.
The jury rejected Millennium's argument that the free POCT cups were not an improper inducement for referrals. Instead, the jury credited the evidence that Ameritox presented that many of the doctors with cup agreements could not bill for the POC testing,4 so those doctors were not giving up anything in exchange for the free POCT cups. Ameritox showed, and the jury accepted, that Millennium's provision of free POCT cups was simply an improper way to induce referrals, as it was a violation of the AKS and Stark Law. As a result, the jury found that such conduct amounted to unfair competition and tortious interference in Florida, Tennessee, and Texas, and the jury awarded Ameritox $2,755,000 in compensatory damages. (Doc. No. 620). The jury also awarded Ameritox $12,000,000 in punitive damages for these claims, which the Court reduced to $8,505,000. (Doc. No. 620, 684).
Thereafter, Ameritox filed a motion and proposed Bill of Costs, in which it sought an award of $1,043,744.28 in costs. (Doc. No. 663, 664). The Magistrate Judge considered Ameritox's motion for costs and Millennium's response, and the Magistrate Judge issued an Order in which he determined that Ameritox should be awarded $239,922.64 in costs. (Doc. No. 693).
II. Motion to Stay Enforcement of or to Amend the Cost Determination
In response to the Magistrate Judge's order, Millennium filed the instant motion for alternative relief. Specifically, Millennium asks that the Court either: (1) stay enforcement of the Magistrate Judge's order pending [*3] a resolution of the appeal; or (2) amend the Magistrate Judge's order regarding the amount of costs to be awarded. As explained below, the Court denies both requests for relief.
A. Enforcement of Costs
Millennium first requests that the Court stay enforcement of the Magistrate Judge's order pending a resolution of the appeal in this case, because if Millennium is successful and obtains a reversal, the costs motion would be mooted. This Court has discretion to stay the taxation of costs pending an appeal. See King Cole Condominium Association, Inc. v. QBE Ins. Corp., 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 91901 , 2010 WL 3212091 , at *2 (S.D. Fla. Aug. 12, 2010). However, the Court declines to exercise such discretion in this case.
In making this determination, the Court has considered: (1) whether Millennium is likely to prevail on the merits of its appeal; (2) whether Millennium will suffer irreparable harm absent a stay; (3) whether Ameritox will suffer substantial harm if the stay is issued; and (4) whether the stay is adverse to public interest. See Breedlove v. Hartford Life & Accident Ins. Co., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12468 , [2013 BL 26443], 2013 WL 361825 , at *1 (M.D. Fla. Jan. 30, 2013). The Court concludes that Millennium is not likely to prevail on appeal and has not shown that it will suffer irreparable harm absent a stay. As such, its request that enforcement of the costs order be stayed pending appeal is denied.
Next, Millennium argues that its prior supersedeas bond should be sufficient and it should not be required to post further bond, because it has the financial ability to cover a cost award. Ameritox opposes this request and asks that Millennium be required to post a bond to cover the cost award, because the prior bond only covers the damages award. The Court agrees that Millennium must post a bond to secure the cost award, and as such, the Court denies Millennium's request to not post further bond.
B. Amount of Costs
Next, Millennium contends that this Court should amend the amount of costs awarded to Ameritox. Millennium makes several arguments in support of this contention, and the Court addresses each argument in turn.
1. Magistrate Judge's Authority
First, Millennium argues that a magistrate judge does not have the authority to rule on a post-trial motion for costs, as 28 U.S.C. § 636 only allows a magistrate judge to rule on pretrial matters. Even if the Court accepts Millennium's argument that a magistrate judge does not have the authority to issue a final order on a motion for costs (absent the parties' consent), the Court concludes that the Magistrate Judge in this case had the authority to issue a Report and Recommendation on the amount of costs to be awarded. See Fharmacy Records v. Nassar, 465 Fed. Appx. 448 , 455 (6th Cir. 2012)(stating that a magistrate judge has the authority to issue a Report and Recommendation regarding post-trial matters of attorneys' fees and costs, pursuant to § 636(b)(3)'s additional duties provision).
Accordingly, this Court will deem the Magistrate Judge's order on costs to be a Report and Recommendation, to which Millennium has filed an objection. The Court has conducted a de novo review of those portions of the Magistrate [*4] Judge's order to which Millennium has objected, and as such, there can be no prejudice to Millennium by the Court's referral of the motion to tax costs to the Magistrate Judge.
2. Specific Objections
Millennium argues that the Magistrate Judge erred in his award of $156,919.24 in costs related to copies of electronic discovery (for which Ameritox sought $753,718.32). Specifically, Millennium argues that no electronic discovery costs should be awarded in this case, or alternatively, the maximum amount awarded for such costs should be $15,914.70. The Court has reviewed the underlying motion for costs and the response, as well as the Magistrate Judge's order, Millennium's objection, Ameritox's response, and the relevant case law, and the Court concludes that the Magistrate Judge's recommendation of an award of $156,919.24 in costs related to copies of electronic discovery should be adopted. Accordingly, the Court overrules Millennium's objection on this issue.
Next, Millennium argues that the Magistrate Judge erred by not reducing the overall cost award based on Ameritox's limited overall success in this case. The Court rejects this argument. While Ameritox did not win on every claim and theory of unfair competitive conduct in every state at issue, the jury returned an actual damages award of $2,755,000 and a punitive damages award of $12,000,000 (which the Court reduced to $8,505,000). In addition, the jury found for Ameritox on its claims that the provision of free POCT cups violated the AKS and Stark Law. To say that Ameritox obtained limited overall success is not accurate, and the Court concludes that this requested reduction in costs must be denied. Accordingly, the Court adopts the Magistrate Judge's order on costs (Doc. No. 693) in its entirety.
III. Motion for a Temporary Stay
Finally, Millennium moves for a 14-day temporary stay of this Order on costs so that it has sufficient time to post a supersedeas bond. Ameritox responds that a 14-day stay is unnecessary, and any stay should be limited to five days. The Court finds that Millennium's 14-day stay request will not harm Ameritox, and as such, the Court grants Millennium's motion on this issue.
IV. Conclusion
Accordingly, it is ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that:
(1) Millennium's motion to stay enforcement of costs or to amend the Magistrate Judge's cost determination (Doc. No. 696) is DENIED.
(2) The Magistrate Judge's Order on costs (Doc. No. 693) is adopted and incorporated by reference in this Order of the Court
(3) Millennium's Motion for a Temporary Stay (Doc. No. 697) is GRANTED, and Millennium must post a supersedeas bond for the costs award within 14 days of this Order.

THOMAS B. SMITH 
ORDER
Pending before the Court is Plaintiff's Expedited Motion for Extension of Time to File Motion for Class Certification and for Amendment of Pleadings (Doc. 96). Defendants oppose the motion (Doc. 99). The Court held a hearing on the issues presented on May 27, 2016, at which time it requested the transcript of a portion of the deposition testimony of Defendants' Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6) witness. That transcript has been received (Doc. 112), and now, for the reasons that follow, the motion is due to be granted in part and denied in part.
The complaint in this putative national class action alleges that Defendants discriminate against credit applicants with disabilities who rely on Social Security Disability Insurance ("SSDI") or other long-term disability benefits to qualify for mortgage loans (Doc. 1, ¶ 2). Plaintiff brings this action
on behalf of individuals who rely upon long-term SSDI (or other long-term disability benefits) as income and who were asked or required by SunTrust to provide medical information and/or assurances from the Social Security Administration regarding future benefits as a pre-condition for processing an application for a mortgage loan and/or obtaining a mortgage loan.
( Id., ¶ 78).

"A party seeking class certification must affirmatively demonstrate his compliance with [Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 ]—that is, he must be prepared to prove that there are in fact sufficiently numerous parties, common questions of law or fact, etc." Wal— Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338 , 350 , 131 S. Ct. 2541 , 180 L. Ed. 2d 374 (2011) (emphasis in original). "[C]ertification is proper only if 'the trial court is satisfied, after a rigorous analysis, that the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) have been satisfied.'" Id . (quoting Gen. Tel. Co. of the Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147 , 161 , 102 S. Ct. 2364 , 72 L. Ed. 2d 740 (1982)). The Rule 23(a) prerequisites are numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy.1 The requirements of at least one of the three subsections of Rule 23(b) must also be met.2 The burden is on the advocate for the class to establish the propriety of class certification. Heaven v. Trust Co. Bank, 118 F.3d 735 , 737 (11th Cir. 1997); Bussey v. Macon Cty. Greyhound Park, Inc., 562 F. App'x 782 , 787 (11th Cir. 2014).
Rule 23(c)(1)(A) provides that "[a]t an early practicable time after a person sues or is sued as a class representative, the court must determine [*2] by order whether to certify the action as a class action." Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1)(A) . Plaintiffs who bring a class action in this district have 90 days following the filing of the initial complaint within to move for a determination as to whether the case is to be maintained as a class action. M.D. Fla. R. 4.04(b) . The Court recognizes that in many cases plaintiffs will require some discovery in order to meet their burden to satisfy the requirements for class certification under Rule 23 . This is why M.D. Fla. R. 4.04(b) provides that "[i]f discovery relating to class action issues is needed, the parties may move the Court for leave to take such discovery prior to the case management meeting."
Plaintiff filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on September 16, 2014 (Doc. 1). On December 4, 2014, she filed her consent motion to suspend or extend the deadline for filing a motion for class certification (Doc. 8). She also asked the court to set a briefing schedule requiring her class certification motion to be filed on a date after the parties had an opportunity to conduct necessary discovery ( Id. at 3). The court granted the motion, stating that it would "set a class certification briefing schedule in the Initial Scheduling Order." (Doc. 9).
Defendants moved to dismiss Plaintiff's complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction (Doc. 14). The issue was briefed and on September 21, 2015, the district court denied the motion (Doc. 29). In the same order, the court transferred the case to the Middle District of Florida ( Id.). The case was actually transferred on October 5, 2015, and this Court entered standard orders the next day (Docs. 31-32, 35).
The parties met on November 20 and again on December 3 to conduct their initial case management conference (Doc. 72). They filed their case management report on December 4, 2015 ( Id.). In the report, Plaintiff proposed an August 1, 2016 deadline for motions to add parties and amend the pleadings, and a February 6, 2017 deadline for filing a motion for class certification (Doc. 72-1). Defendants proposed a deadline in one to two months to amend and add parties, and 90 days to file the class certification motion (Doc. 72-2). Defendants also offered as a compromise, a May 30, 2016 deadline for the class certification motion ( Id.). The district judge held a hearing and on February 6, he entered an Order giving Plaintiff through May 30, 2016 to file her motion for class certification (Docs. 88-89). The district judge also set a May 30 deadline for motions to amend the pleadings ( Id.).
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 16(b)(4) provides that once the court enters a scheduling order, the "schedule may be modified only for good cause and with the judge's consent." The "good cause standard precludes modification [of the scheduling order] unless the schedule cannot 'be met despite the diligence of the party seeking the extension.'" Sosa v. Airprint Sys., Inc., 133 F.3d 1417 , 1418 (11th Cir. 1998) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b) advisory committee's note). "A finding of lack of diligence on the part of the party seeking modification ends the good cause inquiry." Lord v. Fairway Elec. Corp., 223 F. Supp. 2d 1270 , 1277 (M.D. Fla. July 1, 2002). See also Barnette v. Fed. Express [*3] Corp., No. 2:10-cv-471-FtM-36SPC, [2011 BL 156717], 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 65179 , 2011 WL 2413437 , at * 1 (M.D. Fla. June 14, 2011).
Plaintiff argues that there is good cause for a 90 day extension of the deadlines to file her motion for class certification and amend the pleadings because, despite her diligence, necessary discovery still is not complete (Doc. 96). Defendants argue that Plaintiff has not diligently pursued discovery, the information she seeks is not easily accessible or searchable, and it will not support class certification (Doc. 99 at 1-15). Defendants also argue that Plaintiff has not explained why she needs additional time to amend her pleadings, she does not deserve more time, and her request is untimely ( Id. at 15-21).
Plaintiff served interrogatories and requests for production to Defendants on February 1, 2016 (Doc. 96, ¶ 5). This was the first (and to the Court's knowledge) only discovery propounded by Plaintiff. The Court has not seen the discovery, which Plaintiff says is "designed to obtain evidence establishing the Rule 23 factors, including numerosity, ascertainability, and manageability." ( Id.). Plaintiff's request for production sought two categories of documents that are relevant to the current dispute.
First, she asked Defendants to produce copies of their loan policies and procedures. Plaintiff argues that before she can move for class certification she needs copies of all of the policies and procedures she is challenging.3 Plaintiff explains that this information is necessary to show Defendants' discriminatory policy and the class wide application of that policy. Defendants agree that their policies and procedures are relevant to the class certification issues, and they represent that they produced this information months ago. Plaintiff acknowledges the receipt of some policies and procedures but complains that she still does not have at least nine types of underwriting policies for multiple years. The Court does not have sufficient information to decide when Defendants produced their policies and procedures or if their production is complete.
Second, Plaintiff asked for Defendants'4 loan files for the relevant period, which the Court understands is September 16, 2009 to the present. In their response to the requests for production, which the Court has not seen, Defendants objected to producing their loan files on multiple grounds, including that it would be unduly burdensome.
After receiving Defendants' responses and objections to the requests for production, counsel engaged in at least six telephonic meet and confers (Doc. 96, ¶ 6). They also exchanged what Plaintiff characterizes as "numerous detailed and substantive emails that attempt to highlight and work through discovery issues that are currently hindering Plaintiffs' ability to move for class certification, in an effort to resolve disagreements regarding the scope of Plaintiffs' discovery and narrow the issues which may have to be brought before the Court on a motion to compel." ( Id.). This process lasted two months during which Plaintiff explored with Defendants search and retrieval [*4] techniques to obtain information from the loan files ( Id.). She also proposed at least three different search protocols which Defendants rejected. Not only were the parties' meet and confers unsuccessful, but Plaintiff complains that during this period, Defendants were slow to respond to her inquiries, requests, and suggestions.
In their written discovery responses, Defendants indicated that they intended to produce responsive documents on a rolling basis and expected "to substantially complete ... production by no later than April 15, 2016." ( Id., ¶ 7). Defendants did not complete their production by April 15, and even if they had, Plaintiff says that amount of time would have substantially prejudiced her efforts to certify the class ( Id.).
On March 18, 2016, Defendants informed Plaintiff that they were willing to discuss ways to review the loan files but that they were not agreeing to review all the loan files (Doc. 99 at 8). They assert that Plaintiff knew, months before she filed this motion, that Defendants had "no intention of producing the thousands of individual loan files that Plaintiff now claims she so desperately needs." ( Id. at 7). During the hearing, counsel for Defendants represented that on at least two occasions he asked Plaintiff's lawyer if she really wanted all the loan files and she said "no." Plaintiff's lawyer did not refute this representation but, even if Plaintiff did not want the entire files, it is clear that since February she has wanted specific information from them.
Because Defendants were refusing to search the loan files, Plaintiff undertook to find a way to obtain the information she seeks (Doc. 96, ¶ 11). Plaintiff and Defendants conferred for weeks concerning Plaintiff's request for data fields and terms reflecting information captured in the loan files ( Id.). Plaintiff wanted this information in hopes that it would help her identify methods for searching and facilitating Defendants' production of information from the files ( Id.). It took Defendants more than a month to produce an incomplete data field list. Then, on March 23 and again on March 30, Plaintiff asked Defendants to produce ten sample loan files to assist her in developing a search protocol. On March 31, Defendants agreed and on April 2, they delivered the sample files.
Once she obtained the sample loan files, Plaintiff engaged electronic discovery expert David Carns to analyze them (Doc. 96-1). "Using commonly available technology and techniques (such as Optimal Character Recognition and full text searching), [Carns] was able to quickly identify documents that contained terms suggested by Plaintiff's counsel such as 'disability income' and 'disability' within three words of 'occupation.' These basic searches landed upon documents that appear to represent documents indicating that the borrower reported SSDI. Using standard technology and search techniques, [Carns] was able to identify these documents within a matter of seconds." ( Id., ¶ 5). Based upon Carns' report, Plaintiff states that she "is in the process of conferring with Defendants' counsel [*5] regarding her request for production of potential class member loan files, and is prepared to seek the Court's assistance if necessary." ( Id., ¶ 12). Plaintiff seeks the information she expects to obtain from the loan files to aid her in establishing the ascertainability of the class, the number of people in the putative class, the commonality of Defendants' practices, and the common experiences of the class members ( Id.). Plaintiff acknowledges that once she receives the loan files or relevant parts of them, it will take time to locate and analyze the information she seeks in order to prepare her motion for class certification ( Id., ¶ 14).
Defendants state that Carns' findings are factually wrong (Doc. 99 at 11). They explain that the only reason Carns was able to search the ten sample loan files was because they converted them into a searchable format before producing them ( Id.). According to Defendants, when their loan officers receive income information from loan applicants it is categorized using forty different income types including for example, wages, tips, alimony/child support, capital gains, and other types of income (Doc. 99-1, ¶ 4). SSDI is not listed as a separate income category that can be queried in isolation ( Id., ¶ 5). Rather, it is combined in a broader category called "Social Security/Disability Income" that includes, in addition to SSDI, social security income, pension income, military benefits, and other income sources ( Id., ¶ 6). For the period from September 16, 2009 to the present, there are over 150,000 loan files that contain information in the "Social Security/Disability Income" category ( Id., ¶ 9).
Defendants represent that a two-step process is required before it is possible to electronically search the loan files. First, the individual files must be accessed and manually downloaded ( Id., ¶ 10). Then, to review the files for particular applicants, Defendants must separately locate and export each individual loan file ( Id.). The files consist of PDF and TIFF images of separate documents which may or may not be in a text searchable format ( Id.). Even if the documents contain searchable text, the system does not have the technical capability to search the contents of the documents within the loan files ( Id.). The loan file system also does not have the ability to mass export documents related to the files ( Id., ¶ 11).
Once the files are accessed they must be converted into a searchable format (Doc. 99 at 12). The only way to do this is "a manual review of each loan, to ascertain or identify the number of individuals or each individual person who was asked or required (or informed they would be required) to provide information or documentation relating to the continuance of income derived from SSDI." (Doc. 99-1, ¶ 12). Defendants assert that even if they manually review the loan files "to ascertain a population of individuals that were in fact SSDI recipients," there is no way "in which to search the system for each of these individuals that were asked or required (or informed they would be required) ... to provide medical information and/or assurances from the Social Security [*6] Administration." ( Id., ¶ 13).
After the loan files are downloaded they must be converted into a searchable format using software such as Optical Character Recognition ("OCR") (Doc. 99-2, ¶ 5). "But first, the documents must be loaded into a database where an index of all searchable words can be created that will allow for fast and accurate searches to be performed." (Doc. 99 at 13). Defendants claim that "a large volume of documents can take hours or even days to import and index before they are electronically searchable." ( Id.).
After this work is completed, Plaintiff will have to review and analyze the thousands of individual loan files to determine which have information indicating loan applicants who "'were asked or required ... to provide medical information and/or assurances from the Social Security Administration.'" ( Id. at 14-15) (quoting Doc. 1, ¶ 78). Defendants claim that no electronic search will substitute for a manual review of the individual loan files ( Id. at 15).
Plaintiff first requested a Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6) deposition of Defendants on March 30, 2016 (Doc. 96, ¶ 14). Due to the lack of production by Defendants, Plaintiff proposed that the deposition be bifurcated and that the first installment be held on April 16. Defendants objected to Plaintiff's proposed areas of inquiry and on May 6, Plaintiff submitted a new deposition topic list. Defendants responded that they were available for the deposition on May 27 (the date of the hearing) or in June.
By the time the hearing was held, Defendants had produced almost 175,000 pages of discovery (Doc. 99 at 4). Roughly 5,000 pages were furnished 24 hours before the hearing. Defendants describe this as a supplemental production including bulletins and policies adopted by Defendants within the last month, additional training materials, and emails related to complaint files.
On May 27 Plaintiff deposed Janice C. Bassett, who is Defendants' Rule 30(b)(6) witness concerning the systems they use to maintain loan files, the ability to query those systems, and the ability to export and search information contained in the loan files. Plaintiff's recollection of the testimony was that it is possible to search the STM Partners ("STM") database solely for social security income. Defendants disagreed. At the Court's request, counsel provided relevant excerpts of Bassett's testimony (Doc. 112). According to Bassett, the STM database can be queried for just the Social Security/Disability category of income ( Id. at 22-23). Unfortunately, the result is approximately 150,000 loan files which still include multiple types of income ( Id. at 30-31). Bassett testified that the only way to narrow the results further would be a manual review of the files ( Id. at 31-32).
This is the current status of electronic discovery in the case. This case is a textbook example of why it is so important for parties to meet and confer at the earliest possible time to discuss issues surrounding the discovery of electronically stored information. It also demonstrates the importance of early dialogue concerning what discovery on class questions will be needed [*7] and how to conduct that discovery efficiently and economically. The Court does not know what the parties discussed before or at their Rule 26(f) conference, but it is apparent that more should have been done. This is also a case that would have benefitted from the early involvement of electronic discovery experts on both sides. Conversation between the experts should have significantly accelerated the time it has taken Plaintiff to learn what systems Defendants have, and what information those systems are capable of providing. This is the sort of cooperation the Court expects from the parties in the discovery process. A Rule 30(b)(6) deposition should not be necessary to obtain straightforward information about a party's electronic information systems.
The Court's responsibility is to decide whether Plaintiff has shown good cause for a 90 day extension of the deadline to file her motion for class certification and motions to amend the pleadings. To answer this question the Court must decide whether Plaintiff has diligently pursued the discovery she says she needs. Diligence means that a party has worked earnestly, steadily, energetically and conscientiously to accomplish their goal. Using this definition, the Court finds that prior to February 1, 2016 Plaintiff was not as diligent as she could have been. After that date, Plaintiff acted diligently but not as effectively as she could have.
In December 2014, Plaintiff asked the District of Columbia court to suspend or extend the deadline to file her motion for class certification. This evidences her awareness of her obligation to file a timely motion for class certification and that she required discovery to make that motion. The court said it would include a briefing schedule in its initial scheduling order but almost ten months later, no scheduling order had been entered and the case was transferred to the Middle District of Florida.
When this Court received the case in October 2014, the parties were operating under the 90 day deadline for class certification motions established by M.D. Fla. R. 4.04(b) . But, Plaintiff's actions do not suggest a sense of urgency. She could have, but failed to file a motion to conduct class certification discovery in advance of the Rule 26(f) conference. When the Court asked why she did not file a motion for early discovery, Plaintiff said the parties were busy conferring about the nature of the action, debating whether it should be designated as a Track Two or Track Three case, they were briefing scheduling issues for the Court, and Plaintiff was briefing the motions to dismiss. No doubt Plaintiff was working on other aspects of the case, but the Court fails to understand why discovery and those other tasks could not have been performed concurrently. The result is that significant time was lost during which Plaintiff might have been conducting class certification discovery.5 
After Plaintiff served her requests for production she attempted to work cooperatively with Defendants to obtain the information she [*8] seeks. That is what counsel are supposed to do. But, at some point Plaintiff should have recognized that her efforts were not being productive and she should have filed a motion to compel. Plaintiff knew in March, 2016 that Defendants were objecting to the production of their loan files and that they were unwilling to review all the files. At that point, she should have filed a motion to compel. Nobody knows what the outcome of that motion would have been, but the Court's ruling would have established the parameters for discovery and the parties could have proceeded accordingly. Plaintiff's failure to promptly file a motion to compel has unduly delayed the discovery process.
Even though the Court is critical of the manner in which Plaintiff has pursued discovery, it cannot say that since February 1, 2016 she has not acted earnestly, steadily, energetically, and conscientiously to obtain the information she seeks. Therefore, the Court finds good cause and GRANTS, albeit with some reluctance, Plaintiff's motion to extend to August 29, 2016 the deadline for filing Plaintiff's motion for class certification.
This brings the Court to Plaintiff's motion to extend for ninety days the deadline to file motions to amend the pleadings. After the hearing, Plaintiff filed a motion for leave to file a first amended complaint (Doc. 107). The Court will act on that motion in the ordinary course. At the conclusion of the May 27 hearing, the Court recognized that its decision would come after the May 30 deadline for filing motions for leave to amend and the motion for class certification. For this reason, the Court tolled the deadline for fourteen days, i.e., through June 13, 2016. The Court's written order only refers to the motion for class certification, but was intended to include motions to amend the pleadings (Doc. 108). Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff's motion for leave to amend was timely filed. Plaintiff having filed a motion to amend, her request for a 90 day extension of the deadline for motions for leave to amend is DENIED without prejudice.

Numerosity requires that "the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable." Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1) . Commonality requires that "there are questions of law or fact common to the class." Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2) . Typicality requires that "the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class." Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3) .

Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b) provides:
Types of Class Actions. A class action may be maintained if Rule 23(a) is satisfied and if:
(1) prosecuting separate actions by or against individual class members would create a risk of:
(A) inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual class members that would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the party opposing the class; or
(B) adjudications with respect to individual class members that, as a practical matter, would be dispositive of the interests of the other members not parties to the individual adjudications or would substantially impair or impede their ability to protect their interests;
(2) the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole; or
(3) the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy. The matters pertinent to these findings include:
(A) the class members' interests in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions;
(B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already begun by or against class members;
(C) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum; and
(D) the likely difficulties in managing a class action.

LURANA S. SNOW, UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE.

LURANA S. SNOW 
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
THIS CAUSE is before the Court on Relator's Motion and Incorporated Memorandum of Law in Support of Their Bill of Costs Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1920 and Local Rule 7.3(c) (ECF No. 326), which was referred to United States Magistrate Judge, Lurana S. Snow, for a Report and Recommendation. The motion is fully briefed and ripe for consideration.
This was an action originally brought under the False Claims Act against the Defendant, a university which receives federal funding. In order to establish eligibility for funding, the Defendant agreed that it would not provide any commission, bonus or payment to any employee based on that employee's success in enrolling or securing aid for students. According to the Relators, the Defendant submitted 222,206 false claims, resulting in billions of dollars in damages and civil penalties. After a four-day bench trial, this Court determined that the Defendant had submitted 2 false claims, which had not resulted in any actual damages. The Court imposed a civil penalty of $5,500.00 for each false claim, for a total award of $11,000.00. (ECF No. 318)
The Relators now seek to tax costs against the Defendant in the total amount of $80,495.23, consisting of $350.00 in fees of the clerk; $1,488.36 in fees for service of summons and subpoena; $26,866.05 in fees for transcripts; $1,327,51 in fees for witnesses, and $47,801.11 in fees for exemplification [*2] and copies. The Defendant asserts that no costs should be awarded based on the nominal recovery achieved by the Relators. Alternatively, the Defendant argues that the claimed costs should be reduced by $53,448.84, for a total award of $27,046.39.1 In their Reply Memorandum, the Relators address only the Defendant's contention that no costs should be awarded.
I. DISCUSSION 
A. ENTITLEMENT TO COSTS 
Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d) and 28 U.S.C. § 1920 , the Court shall award costs to the prevailing party in a lawsuit. Rule 54(d) creates a presumption in favor of awarding costs, which the opposing party must overcome. Manor Healthcare Corp. v. Lomelo, 929 F.2d 633 , 639 (11th Cir. 1991).
Rule 54(d)(1) provides, in pertinent part, "Except when express provision therefor is made either in a statute of the United States or in these rules, costs other than attorneys' fees shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party, unless the court otherwise directs." Taxable costs are identified in 28 U.S.C. § 1920 :
(1) Fees of the clerk and marshal;
(2) Fees of the court reporter for all or any part of the stenographic transcript necessarily obtained for use in the case;
(3) Fees and disbursements for printing and witnesses;
(4) Fees for exemplification and the costs of making copies of materials where the copies are necessarily obtained for use in the case;
(5) Docket fees under section 1923 of this title;
(6) Compensation of court appointed experts, compensation of interpreters, and salaries, fees, expenses, and costs of special interpretation services under section 1828 of this title.
Rule 54(d) also grants the Court the discretion to refuse to tax costs in favor of the prevailing party. Crawford Fitting Co. v. J.T. Gibbons, Inc., 482 U.S. 437 , 442 , 107 S. Ct. 2494 , 96 L. Ed. 2d 385 (1987).

The Supreme Court has held that a prevailing party is one who prevailed on "any significant issue in the litigation which achieved some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing suit." Tex. State Teachers Ass'n v. Garland Indep. Sch. Dist., 489 U.S. 782 , 791-92 , 109 S. Ct. 1486 , 103 L. Ed. 2d 866 (1989)(internal citations and quotations omitted). In most instances, the litigant in whose favor judgment is rendered is the prevailing party for purposes of Rule 54(d) , and a party who has obtained some relief will be regarded as the prevailing party, even though he has not sustained all of his claims.
In the instant case, the Defendant argues that this Court should exercise its discretion by refusing to award costs to the Relators based on their recovery of only a tiny percentage of the damages and penalties they sought. However, courts in this Circuit consistently have approved shifting costs even if the prevailing party obtains judgment on a fraction of the claims he has advanced. Head v. Medford, 62 F.3d 351 , 355 (11th Cir. 1995); United States v. Mitchell, 580 F.2d 789 , 793-94 (5th Cir. 1978); Doria v. Class Action Services, LLC, 261 F.R.D. 678 , 682 (S.D. Fla. 2009).
It is undisputed that the Relators are the prevailing parties in this case. Although this Court has the discretion to refuse an award of costs, the only basis for such refusal advanced by the Defendant is the relatively modest amount of penalties assessed. The undersigned recommends that this argument be rejected and that costs be awarded under Rule 54(d) .
B. AMOUNT OF COSTS 
1. SERVICE [*3] OF SUMMONS AND SUBPOENA 
The Relators seek an award of $1,488.36 for service of process. The Relators utilized a private process server rather than having the marshal serve witness subpoenas, but this is permissible "provided the rate charged does not exceed the cost of having a U.S. Marshal effect service." EEOC v. W & O, Inc., 213 F. 3d 600 , 624 (11th Cir. 2000). The current rate charged by the U.S. Marshal is $65 per hour (or portion thereof) for each person served, plus travel costs and other out-of-pocket expenses. 28 C.F.R. § 0.114(a)(3) .
The Defendant's only challenge to the requested amount for service of process is the claims for service of trial subpoenas on nine witnesses, two of whom were served twice. The process server charged $80.00 for service on each witness, which included a "rush fee." (ECF No. 326-3 at 6-15) The Relator claimed that the rush was necessitated by the fact that the Defendant initially did not agree to produce these witnesses for trial. The Defendant points out that it was under no obligation to do so, and that the trial date was set more than a year in advance. The undersigned agrees that there was no reason why these witnesses could not have been served early enough to avoid the rush fee, and the claimed costs of service should be reduced by $15.00 for each witness served, for a total reduction of $165.00. Accordingly, the award of costs for service of summons and subpoena should total $1,323.36.
2. TRANSCRIPTS 
The Relators claim a total of $26,866.05 in fees for printed or electronically recorded transcripts necessarily obtained for use in the case. The Defendant contends that this amount should be reduced by $3,562.62 because the costs for expedited production and/or delivery, CD depo litigation packages, electronic delivery and video synchronization are not taxable. The Defendant does not challenge ordinary shipping and delivery costs.
Courts have held that some costs related to depositions and transcripts are not taxable because they were incurred for the convenience of counsel. Klayman v. Freedom's Watch, Inc., [2008 BL 305209], 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118672 , 2008 WL 4194881 at *5-6 (S.D.Fla., Sept. 12, 2008) (expedited shipping, ASCII disks, e-transcripts, word index, condensed copy, CD-rom, real time hookup, additional DVDs and storage charges not recoverable); RGF Environmental Group v. Activ Tek Environmental Corp., [2010 BL 400113], 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84340 , 2010 WL 3269982 at *3 (S.D.Fla., July 21, 2010) (deposition exhibits, delivery charges, expedited fees, postage costs, condensed transcripts, ASCII disks and copies of transcripts not recoverable); Woods v. Deangelo Marine Exhaust Inc., [2010 BL 400461], 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 110293 , 2010 WL 4116571 at *8 (S.D.Fla., Sept. 27, 2010) (court reporter charges related to the delivery of transcripts, handling of exhibits and CD copies not recoverable).
The undersigned agrees with the Defendant that neither the $35.00 costs of CD depo litigation packages for eight witnesses (ECF No. 326-4 at 3, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18), the $25.00 charge for electronic delivery (ECF No. 326-4 at 6), nor the $1,625.00 for video synchronization (ECF No. 326-4 at 4, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19) are taxable, resulting in a reduction in taxable transcript costs of $1,930.00. Regarding the expedited production costs, identified by the Relators as [*4] totaling $3,257.62 (ECF No. 326 at 7)2, the Relators contend that these costs were reasonably incurred because of the need to refer to these depositions in their motion for summary judgment. The Defendant points out that the deadline for filing motions for summary judgment had been set for more than a year, and two of the expedited depositions were taken after that deadline. The undersigned finds that the need for expedited depositions was created by the Relators themselves, who could have scheduled the depositions in time for ordinary production and delivery. Accordingly, the costs for expediting the depositions is not taxable, resulting in a total award for transcripts of $21,678.43 ($26,866.05 - $1,930.00 - $3,257.62).
3. EXEMPLIFICATION AND COPIES 
The Relators claim a total of $47,801.11 in fees for exemplification and the costs of making copies of materials where the copies are necessarily obtained for use in the case, consisting of $3,989.71 in photocopying charges ($1,698.37 to FedEx Kinkos and for in-house copying and $2,662.20 to third parties); $19,806.90 in litigation database costs, and $26,295.84 for trial consultants and demonstrative video evidence. The Defendant contends that the copying costs should be reduced and that the costs of the litigation database, trial consultants and demonstrative video evidence be disallowed.
A. Photocopying Charges 
The Defendant first contends that the photocopying charges of $951.73 to FedEx Kinkos should be disallowed because the Plaintiff did not provide sufficient information to determine whether these copies were necessarily obtained for use in the case. The Defendant notes that the Relators did identify $311.72 as the costs of making copies for their mediation presentation, but argues that this charge should be disallowed because these copies were obtained for the convenience of counsel and because the Relators have not supplied an invoice reflecting the charge, as required by Local Rule 7.3(c) .
In Scelta v. Delicatessen Support Services, Inc., 203 F. Supp.2d 1328 , 1340 (M.D.Fla., May 13, 2002), the Court noted that under 28U.S.C. § 1920(4) photocopying is compensable if it was necessarily obtained for use in the case. "In making this determination, 'the court should consider whether the prevailing party could have reasonably believed that it was necessary to copy the papers in issue.'" Id. at 1340 , quoting E.E.O.C. v. W & O, Inc., 213 F.3d 600 , 623 (11th Cir. 2000). The court further noted that the burden of establishing entitlement to copying costs lies with the prevailing party, citing Desisto College, Inc. V. Town of Howey-in-the Hills, 718 F.Supp. 906 , 914 (M.D.Fla., Jun. 29, 1989) (holding that the prevailing party must itemize photocopying costs to distinguish compensable copies from those made for the convenience of counsel). The Scelta court held that billing records which merely list "copies" or "photocopies" without any description of the nature or purpose of the photocopying was insufficient. The court acknowledged that while an accounting for each photocopy was implausible, the prevailing party must make some attempt to differentiate recoverable copying costs from non-recoverable [*5] general photocopying expenses. Scelta, 203 F. Supp.2d at 1340 , citing Fulton Fed. Savings & Loan Assoc. of Atlanta v. American Ins. Co., 143 F.R.D. 292 , 300 (N.D. Ga., Aug. 6, 1991).
In their Motion, the Relators state that the cost of copies made by outside vendors were incurred to prepare exhibits and impeachment materials for trial, and to prepare the mediation presentation handouts. The undersigned finds that the Relators have sufficiently identified the nature of the photocopies and have demonstrated that they were necessarily obtained for use in the case. However, the Defendant is correct that the Relators have not provided a receipt for the $311.72 charge for mediation handouts identified in their summary chart. (ECF No. 326-7 at 2) Local Rule 7.3(c) mandates that a bill of costs "shall attach copies of any documentation showing the amount of costs." Therefore, the allowable cost for copies made by FedEx Kinkos must be reduced by $311.72, for a total of $640.01.
Next, the Defendant argues that the claimed cost of $746.64 for in-house printing should be disallowed because the Relators have failed to submit actual invoices or billing records to establish that these copies actually were made. Alternatively, the Defendant suggests that the claimed rate of $.12 per page should be reduced to $.10 per page. Although prevailing parties frequently supply billing records to document charges for in-house copies, the Relators here have supplied a detailed chart listing the dates, subject matter and costs for in-house copying. (ECF No. 326-7 at 4-6). The undersigned finds that this is sufficient to comply with the Local Rule and to establish that the copies were necessarily obtained for use in the case. Accordingly, no reduction of the costs for in-house copying need be made.
Finally, the Defendant asserts that the claimed cost of $2,662.20 paid to third parties for copies should be reduced by $60.63 charged by the Department of Education for review of the documents, minus the $3.00 the Relators erroneously designated as "labor costs" (ECF No. 326-5 at 2) and by the $50.00 cost of Rhonda Fuller's academic records, which were not used at trial. The undersigned agrees that the Relators erroneously claimed $63.63 in labor charges from the Department of Education, while failing to claim $3.00 for copies. Additionally, the Relators have not stated why copies of Rhonda Fuller's academic records were necessarily obtained for use in the case. Therefore, the claimed cost of copies obtained from third parties must be reduced by $110.63, for a total of $2,551.57.
Based on these reductions, the Relators are entitled to an award of $3,938.22 ($640.01 + $746.64 + $2,551.57) for photocopies.
B. ESI Litigation and Database Costs 
The Relators seek an award of $19,806.90 paid to U.S. Legal Support for creating and maintaining a litigation database for the ESI produced in this case. The Defendant responds that there is no support in this Circuit for awarding such payments as costs under § 1920 , and that this cost was incurred for the convenience of counsel. The Defendant points out that it produced ESI as PST (Microsoft Outlook) files which could have been [*6] reviewed in email form and searched using Microsoft Outlook's search function.
The Plaintiff relies on Klayman v. Freedom's Watch, Inc., [2008 BL 305209], 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118672 , 2008 WL 4194881 at *7 (S.D.Fla., Sept. 12, 2008), where the court stated, "Costs for creating a litigation database, trial evidence presentation, and copies are recoverable under 28 U.S.C. § 1920 where it is necessary due to the extreme complexity of the case and the organization of millions of documents." However, the court in Klayman declined to award such costs because the prevailing party had failed to demonstrate that they were necessary.
The Defendant responds by pointing out that this dicta in Klayman was specifically rejected by the court in Finnerty v. Stiefel Laboratories, Inc., 900 F.Supp.2d 1317 , 1321-22 (S.D.Fla., Oct. 16, 2012), which denied the taxation of costs for the creation and use of a searchable database. In Finnerty, the court pointed out that the magistrate judge's report in Klayman, as well as the case on which the magistrate judge relied, were decided before the 2008 amendment to 28 U.S.C. § 1920(4) enacted to authorize the taxation of the costs of copying any "materials." The Finnerty court noted that this amendment clearly permitted the taxation of costs for making digital copies, but held that
Congress's amendment of Section 1920(4) did not expand taxable costs beyond digital copying to the creation of new, modified, or enhanced digital files. A prevailing party may tax the costs of making digital copies, but "Section 1920(4) does not state that all steps that lead up to the production of copies of materials are taxable."
Id. at 1322 (quoting Race Tires America, Inc. v. Hoosier Racing Tire Corp., 674 F.3d 158 , 165 (3rd Cir. 2012)).

Other courts also have held that the costs of creating a searchable database are not taxable under § 1920 because such costs are incurred for the convenience of counsel. Akanthos Capital Management, LLC v. Compucredit Holdings Corporation, 2 F.Supp.3d 1306 , 1318 (N.D. Ga., Mar. 7, 2014); Fells v. Virginia Dept. of Transportation, 605 F.Supp.2d 740 (E.D.Va., Mar. 25, 2009). The undersigned finds the reasoning of these cases to be persuasive, particularly in the instant case where there was another means of searching ESI available to the Relators which would have obviated the cost of hiring U.S. Legal Support. Therefore, the claimed cost of $19,806.90 for the creation and maintenance of a litigation database should be disallowed.
C. Trial Consultants and Demonstrative Video Evidence 
The Relators request an award of $26,295.44 paid to Decision Quest for the creation of demonstrative exhibit evidence, as well as creating and coordinating the use of video designations for impeachment. They concede that the Eleventh Circuit has not held that such costs are recoverable. The Defendant responds by pointing out that the role of Relators' consultant was simply to play portions of video depositions and highlight portions of exhibits on video screens. The Defendant cites Akanthos, 2 F.Supp.3d at 1313 , for the proposition that the costs of graphics and technology services are not taxable, and Morrison v. Reichhold Chemicals, Inc., 97 F.3d 460 , 465-66 (11th Cir. 1996), holding that costs for equipment rental and fees charged by a videographer for playback [*7] of video depositions at trial may not be taxed.
The undersigned agrees with the Defendant that there is no basis under § 1920(4) to award the costs of fees paid to Decision Quest, and this cost should be disallowed. Therefore, the Relators total award for exemplification and copies is $3,938.22.
4. WITNESS FEES 
The Relators request an award of witness fees in the amount of $1,357.51, which includes a hotel charge of $241.98 for the Relators' expert witness. (ECF No. 326-6 at 15) The Defendant correctly points out that the allowable GSA per diem rate for Fort Lauderdale, Florida on July 14, 2014 was $108.00. (ECF No. 338-1) Therefore, the Relators' claimed witness fees must be reduced by $133.98, for a total taxable amount of $1,223.53.
II. CONCLUSION 
This Court having considered carefully the pleadings, arguments of counsel, and the applicable case law, it is hereby
RECOMMENDED that Relator's Motion and Incorporated Memorandum of Law in Support of Their Bill of Costs Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1920 and Local Rule 7.3(c) (ECF No. 326) be GRANTED, in part, and that costs be awarded to the Relators in the amount of $28,523.54 ($1,323.36 for service of process + $21,678.43 for transcripts + $3938.22 for copies + $1,233.53 for witnesses + $350.00 filing fee).
The parties will have 14 days from the date of being served with a copy of this Report and Recommendation within which to file written objections, if any, with The Honorable William P. Dimitrouleas , United States District Judge. Failure to file objections timely shall bar the parties from attacking on appeal factual findings contained herein. LoConte v. Dugger, 847 F.2d 745 (11th Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 958 , 109 S. Ct. 397 , 102 L. Ed. 2d 386 (1988); RTC v. Hallmark Builders, Inc., 996 F.2d 1144 , 1149 (11th Cir. 1993).

HARVEY E. SCHLESINGER, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE.

HARVEY E. SCHLESINGER 
ORDER
THIS CAUSE is before the Court on:
1. Plaintiffs' "Motion for Class Certification" (Doc. 76, filed Mar. 2, 2015); Defendants' Response in opposition thereto (Doc. 89, filed Apr. 30, 2015); Plaintiffs' Reply in support thereof (Doc. 107, filed June 30, 2015); Defendants' Sur-Reply in opposition thereto (Doc. 115, filed Aug. 27, 2015); and Plaintiffs' Sur-Sur-Reply in support thereof (Doc. 116, filed Sept. 1, 2015).
2. Defendants' "Motion to Exclude the Opinions of Paul J. Sikorsky" (Doc. 88, filed Apr. 30, 2015); Plaintiffs' Response in opposition thereto (Doc. 101, filed May 26, 2015); and Defendants' Reply in support thereof (Doc. 105, filed June 24, 2015).
3. Defendants' "Motion to Strike Plaintiffs' Trial Expert Disclosures" (Doc. 122, filed Oct. 26, 2015); and Plaintiffs' Response in opposition thereto (Doc. 123, filed Nov. 9, 2015).
4. Defendants' "Motion to Strike the Supplemental Declaration of Paul J. Sikorsky in Further Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification" (Doc. 127, filed Dec. 3, 2015); and Plaintiffs' Response in opposition thereto (Doc. 131, filed Dec. 17, 2015).

The Court conducted a hearing on the above-referenced matters on January 13, 2016, and took all issues under advisement. Upon consideration of the parties' filings, oral argument, and the applicable law, the Court determines the following.
I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND 
Defendants ("Defendants" or "Goodman") are in the business of designing and manufacturing the principal components of air-conditioning and heating systems under the Goodman and Amana brand names ("Goodman [*3] products"). (Doc. 48, ¶¶ 1-2). There are three key components to an air-conditioning system: (1) an evaporator coil, (2) a condenser coil, and (3) a compressor. ( Id. ¶ 31). These components are joined together in a closed, hermetic system that contains refrigerant. ( Id. ¶ 32). At all relevant times for the purposes of this lawsuit, Defendants manufactured the evaporator coil using copper. ( Id. ¶¶ 10, 35-36). Defendants primarily market and sell the component parts to contractors and dealers, who then sell Goodman products to consumers and install them in homes and businesses. (Doc. 89 at 5-6).
A. Previous Complaints and Motions to Dismiss 
On December 19, 2012, Plaintiff PB Property Management, Inc. ("PB Property") filed its first class action complaint against Defendants, alleging breach of express warranty, breach of implied warranty of merchantability, violations of the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act ("FDUTPA"), Fla. Stat. §§ 501.201 et seq., and unjust enrichment. (Doc. 1). PB Property asserted that they purchased several Goodman products that failed during the warranty period, requiring PB Property to incur extensive out-of-pocket expenses to have technicians diagnose, repair and/or replace the defective parts, and replace the refrigerant that had leaked. ( Id. ¶ 3). Specifically, PB Property alleged that the copper evaporator coils used in Goodman products suffer from a manufacturing and/or design defect that causes the coils to prematurely corrode and fail under normal use, causing refrigerant within the system to leak out. ( Id ¶¶ 4-5). PB Property alleged that Defendants had knowledge of this defect, yet failed to disclose this defect to consumers, and represented, marketed, and warranted that Goodman products were free from defects in materials and workmanship. ( Id. ¶¶ 8, 34-38). Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the original complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) on April 12, 2013, (Doc. 18), which the Court granted in part and denied in part on August 28, 2013. (Doc. 30). In that order, the Court denied Defendants' motion as to PB Property's express warranty claim under a theory of unconscionability, but it granted Defendants' motion as to PB Property's express warranty claim under a theory of failure of essential purpose. (Doc. 30 at 7-10). The Court also granted Defendants' motion as to PB Property's FDUTPA claim, dismissing said claim without prejudice to allow PB Property to re-plead the claim with particularity, as it is grounded in fraud. ( Id. at 11-14). Lastly, the Court granted Defendants' motion as to PB Property's implied warranty and unjust enrichment claims, both of which were dismissed with prejudice. ( Id. at 11, 14-16).
PB Property filed a first amended class action complaint on September 11, 2013, and Defendants filed another motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim on September 30, 2013. (Does. 31, 32). On October 21, 2013, the parties filed a joint motion to stay proceedings pending a ruling by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ("JPML") to transfer and consolidate several related cases, which this Court granted on October 23, 2013. (Does. 35, 36). On December 13, 2013, the JPML denied PB Property's motion [*4] to transfer and consolidate, and this Court lifted the stay shortly thereafter. (Doc. 37). On January 14, 2014, PB Property filed a motion to consolidate this case with a related case also in the Middle District of Florida and requested leave to file a consolidated amended class action complaint, with no objection from Defendants. (Doc. 40). This Court granted the motion on January 30, 2014; the two cases consolidated, and Defendants' pending motion to dismiss was rendered moot. (Doc. 43).
B. Plaintiffs' First Consolidated Class Action Complaint 
Plaintiffs PB Property, Janet Helm, Jimmy Jewell, Deborah Wagner, and Stanley Wagner ("Plaintiffs" or "named Plaintiffs") filed their "First Consolidated Class Action Complaint" ("FCCAC") on February 28, 2014. (Doc. 48). The principal factual allegations are largely the same as in PB Property's original complaint. Plaintiffs assert that they are Florida residents who own property in Florida and purchased Goodman products that suffer from a manufacturing and/or design defect that causes the copper evaporator coils to corrode and prematurely fail under normal use, causing leakage of refrigerant. ( Id. ¶¶ 4-6). Plaintiffs assert that they were each forced to incur out-of-pocket expenses to diagnose, repair and/or replace the defective parts, and replace the refrigerant that had leaked. ( Id. ¶ 4). Plaintiffs allege that Defendants had knowledge of this defect, yet failed to disclose this defect to consumers, and represented, marketed, and warranted that Goodman products were free from defects in design and manufacture. ( Id. ¶ 3). The FCCAC alleges the following specific factual allegations of each named Plaintiff.
1. PB Property 
Plaintiff PB Property is a company that is involved in the business of developing construction projects and property management in the Jacksonville, Florida area. (Doc. 48, ¶ 55). In 2007, PB Property constructed an office building in Jacksonville, comprised of six separate office units, which was gradually built out through 2009. ( Id. ¶ 56). PB Property used a local certified contractor to purchase and install 14 Goodman products for the office building. ( Id.). Some of the copper evaporator coils in the installed Goodman products began leaking within 180 days of installation, and as of the date of the FCCAC, PB Property has had to replace seven coils. ( Id. ¶ 57). The coils were under Goodman warranty and the replacement parts were provided free of charge, but PB Property incurred labor costs for some of the replacements. ( Id.). In March 2012, another Goodman product at the office building stopped producing cold air, and the technician found that the system was out of refrigerant. ( Id. ¶ 58). PB Property was charged for the cost of the visit, the replacement refrigerant, and labor associated with replacing the copper evaporator coil. ( Id. ¶¶ 58-59).
PB Property also built and managed other properties that experienced coil issues. In mid-2007, PB Property purchased two Goodman products for a different property in Jacksonville. ( Id. ¶ 61). In mid-2012, one of the units stopped cooling, and repair technicians found that the [*5] system was out of refrigerant due to a leak in the evaporator coil. Plaintiff was charged for the labor associated with diagnosing the issue, replacing the refrigerant, and replacing the coil. ( Id. ¶¶ 61-62). In August 2012, PB Property's director, Mr. Safa Mansouri, notified Goodman of the problems he was experiencing with their products. ( Id. ¶ 60). Further, in October 2012, PB Property was notified that two Goodman products installed at yet another property had failed due to evaporator coil leaks. ( Id. ¶ 63).
2. Janet Helm 
Plaintiff Janet Helm ("Helm") purchased a Goodman product on June 5, 2009, after a salesman from Bayside Heating & Air Conditioning ("Bayside") came to her home and made a presentation about the superior quality of the product and the product's warranty. (Doc. 48, ¶ 67). Thereafter, in 2011, the unit stopped producing cool air, and Helm paid a technician for the labor related to diagnosing the problem and replacing the leaking evaporator coil. ( Id ¶¶ 68-69). In March 2013, Helm's unit again experienced problems, and the service technician noted that the system was very low in refrigerant. ( Id. ¶ 70). Fed up with the product, Helm chose to purchase and replace the Goodman product with another system. ( Id. ¶ 71).
3. Jimmy Jewell 
In September 2008, Plaintiff Jimmy Jewell ("Jewell") purchased a Goodman product to replace his Trane system in his home in Florida. (Doc. 48, ¶ 74). Jewell purchased the unit after a salesman from Superior Cooling and Heating Mgt., Inc. ("Superior") came to his home and made a presentation about Goodman products. ( Id. ¶ 75). Following the presentation, Jewell also reviewed Goodman's website and researched the unit further. ( Id.). Thereafter, Jewell purchased the Goodman product, and it was installed by the contractor. ( Id. ¶¶ 75-76). In May 2009, Jewell began experiencing issues; a Superior technician found the system low in refrigerant and added more. ( Id. ¶ 76). In July 2009, a Superior technician again found the system low in refrigerant and added more. ( Id.). In July 2013, after experiencing more issues, a Superior technician found the copper evaporator coil to be leaking refrigerant and replaced the coil. ( Id.). Jewell incurred out-of-pocket costs related to these services. ( Id). Jewell notified Goodman of the problems with his unit in 2010 and in 2013. ( Id. ¶¶ 77-78).
4. Deborah and Stanley Wagner 
In 2009, Plaintiffs Deborah and Stanley Wagner ("the Wagners") purchased a Goodman product to replace an older Coleman brand unit in their home in Florida. (Doc. 48, ¶ 81). Babione's Air Conditioning and Heating, Inc. ("Babione") installed the unit. ( Id.). The Wagners aver that they chose an Amana brand product (i.e., a Goodman product) because they were familiar with the Amana brand name and had confidence in the quality of the product and the product's warranty. ( Id.). They also researched the Amana brand online and asked a representative at Babione about the brand, and he assured them that Amana brand products were high quality. ( Id.).
In June 2012, the Wagners experienced problems with their unit; a Babione technician found no refrigerant in the system and recharged the unit with more refrigerant. ( Id. ¶ 82). The Wagners [*6] paid for the costs associated with this visit. ( Id.). In July 2013, they again experienced problems with the unit, and a Babione technician found a leak in the evaporator coil. ( Id.). The coil was under warranty and the replacement part was provided free of charge, yet the Wagners had to pay for the associated labor costs in diagnosing the problem, replacing the evaporator coil, and recharging the system again with more refrigerant. ( Id. ¶¶ 83-84).
In September 2013, the unit experienced a major failure, and a Babione technician again found the unit low in refrigerant. ( Id. ¶ 85). The extent of the failure caused damage elsewhere in the system, requiring replacement of the entire system. ( Id.). At this point, the Wagners chose to replace the Goodman product with a Trane product. ( Id. ¶ 86).
C. Survival of the FCCAC 
Defendants responded to Plaintiffs' FCCAC by filing another motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim (Doc. 53), which the Court granted in part and denied in part on August 14, 2014. (Doc. 60).
In the wake of the Court's order, Plaintiffs have two claims that remain standing. Count One is a claim for breach of express warranty based on the theory of unconscionability under Florida law. (Doc. 48, ¶ 111). As Goodman offers a limited, parts-only warranty on its products, when Plaintiffs' copper evaporator coils failed, they were personally required to pay out-of-pocket expenses for the costs of labor and repairs related to the problem. ( Id. ¶¶ 49, 52). Plaintiffs argue that the copper evaporator coils manufactured by Goodman were uniformly defective, that Defendants had knowledge of this defect, and, therefore, that Defendants also knew consumers would have to pay hundreds or thousands of dollars in labor and repairs related to the problem. ( Id. ¶ 50). Plaintiffs assert that the limited, parts-only warranty is unconscionable in light of Defendants' knowledge of the latent defect. ( Id.). Plaintiffs allege that they have suffered and continue to suffer actual damages and losses related to the problem.
Count Two is a claim for violation of the FDUTPA.1 Plaintiffs allege that Defendants engaged in deceptive and unfair business practices by selling Goodman products that they knew to be defective, thereby interfering with the reasonable expectations of Plaintiffs and other consumers. (Doc. 48, ¶ 117). Plaintiffs assert that Defendants made material misrepresentations by marketing Goodman products as high quality, reliable, fit for their ordinary purpose, and free from defects in materials and workmanship. ( Id. ¶¶ 40-43). Further, Plaintiffs assert that Defendants omitted material information regarding the copper evaporator coils' propensity to corrode and fail prematurely. ( Id. ¶¶ 40, 46-47). Plaintiffs allege that they have suffered damages by Defendants' conduct because they would not have purchased the products, or would have paid less for them, had they known about the defects. ( Id. ¶¶ 123-24).
Lastly, the Court declined to hold at the dismissal stage that the named Plaintiffs do not fit within the proposed class, though it also declined to certify Plaintiffs' proposed class. ([*7] Doc. 60 at 11-12, 17). The Court directed the parties to engage in discovery to more precisely define the scope of the class and to determine whether any of the named Plaintiffs fall outside of the proposed class, which would be addressed at a later date. ( Id.).
D. Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification 
Plaintiffs filed their Motion for Class Certification on March 2, 2015, seeking to certify both a damages class and an injunctive and declaratory relief class pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 . (Docs. 76, 84).2 While Plaintiffs tweaked the definition of the proposed damages class as originally set forth in the FCCAC (Cf. Doc. 48, ¶ 21), the substantive parts of the proposed damages class remain largely unchanged. The proposed damages class under Rule 23(b)(3) is defined as:
All individuals and entities in the State of Florida that own or owned real property in which a Goodman Unit (under the Goodman or Amana brand names) containing copper evaporator coil was installed from July 1, 2006 to the present and who suffered damages as a result of having to repair and/or replace their Goodman Products due to leakage of refrigerant.
(Doc. 76 at 12). The FCCAC did not propose a separate injunctive and declaratory relief class. In the Motion for Class Certification, Plaintiffs define this class under Rule 23(b)(2) as:
All individuals and entities in the State of Florida that own real property in which a Goodman Unit (under the Goodman or Amana brand names) containing copper evaporator coil was installed from July 1, 2006 to the present.
( Id.). With the benefit of discovery, Plaintiffs were able to more fully explicate their theory of liability in this case in the Motion for Class Certification. Plaintiffs originally asserted in the FCCAC that the copper evaporator coils were defective because they were generally prone to premature corrosion. Now, Plaintiffs have been able to identify the specific type of corrosion at issue: formicary corrosion.3 This type of corrosion is so named because it resembles a formicary—an ant nest—and causes tiny holes to form in the copper tube walls, which results in the leakage of refrigerant. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants had knowledge that the copper evaporator coils were defectively prone to develop formicary corrosion by July 1, 2006, yet continued to manufacture, market, and sell these coils for many years with a limited, parts-only warranty.

Defendants filed their Response in opposition on April 30, 2015 (Does. 89, 94). Defendants challenge class certification on several fronts. Specifically, Defendants argue that (1) neither class is readily ascertainable without being impermissibly overbroad; (2) individual questions overwhelm any common questions under Rule 23(a)(2) for both the breach of warranty claim and the FDUTPA claim; (3) the named Plaintiffs are not typical and cannot adequately represent the class under Rule 23(a)(3) and (a)(4) ; (4) individual questions predominate over any common questions as to the damages class under Rule 23(b)(3) ; (5) Plaintiffs' proposed damages models do not satisfactorily measure only those damages attributable [*8] to Plaintiffs' theory of liability; and (6) the injunctive and declaratory relief class is impermissibly seeking individualized monetary damages.
Plaintiffs filed their Reply on June 30, 2015 (Docs. 107, 110); Defendants filed their Sur-Reply on August 27, 2015 (Docs. 115, 119); and Plaintiffs filed their Sur-Sur-Reply on September 1, 2015 (Doc. 116). A hearing on the motion was held on January 13, 2016.
E. Defendants' Motion to Exclude the Opinions of Paul J. Sikorsky 
On the same day that Defendants filed their Response to Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification, Defendants also filed their Motion to Exclude the Opinions of Paul J. Sikorsky (Docs. 88, 93). Paul Sikorsky ("Sikorsky") is one of Plaintiffs' experts in this case, and he provided a declaration in support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification. (Does. 76-6, 86). Sikorsky holds a bachelor's and master's degree in metallurgical engineering and has over 30 years of experience in the heating, ventilating, and air conditioning ("HVAC") industry. He analyzed Goodman's warranty claims data and reached conclusions based thereon. He also performed testing on 25 randomly selected Goodman copper evaporator coils that had been returned under warranty as defectively leaking and reached conclusions based thereon. Defendants contend that Plaintiffs rely exclusively on Sikorsky's opinions to support certain Rule 23 requirements in their motion.
Defendants move to strike these opinions under Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579 , 113 S. Ct. 2786 , 125 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1993), and its progeny, as unreliable and unscientific. Once stricken, Defendants argue that class certification must be denied because Plaintiffs have not provided any other admissible evidence to support certain Rule 23 requirements.
In opposition, Plaintiffs argue that the Court should not undertake a full Daubert analysis at the class-certification stage, but in any event, Sikorsky's opinions are reliable and scientific. (Doc. 101). This Court, therefore, must first analyze Defendants' motion to exclude Sikorsky's opinions before considering the merits of Plaintiffs' class certification motion.
F. Defendants' Motion to Strike the Supplemental Declaration of Paul J. Sikorsky in Further Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification 
Sikorsky supplemented his original declaration filed in support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification on November 24, 2015. (Docs. 125, 129). The supplemental declaration updates warranty claim rates for copper evaporator coils for the years 2006 through 2014. The original percentages were included in Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification, and the updated warranty-claim rate percentages are even higher with the new data. On December 3, 2015, Defendants moved to strike the supplemental declaration as untimely; the new figures are based on documents and spreadsheets that Defendants had originally produced to Plaintiffs during discovery, not on any new data or documents. (Doc. 127). Defendants argue the supplemental declaration is also unduly burdensome, prejudicial, and immaterial. ([*9] Id.).
Plaintiffs concede that the updated figures are based on documents and spreadsheets originally produced by Defendants during discovery, but that there were thousands of documents produced by Defendants, and they simply did not discover the existence of the more up-to-date data until recently. (Doc. 131). It was an oversight, but upon discovering the updated warranty claims data, they promptly asked Sikorsky to review it and file a supplemental declaration. ( Id.). Plaintiffs argue that there is no prejudice to Defendants because the supplemental declaration simply updates and reinforces Sikorsky's original opinions; the new data does not contradict Sikorsky's prior statements. ( Id.) In fact, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants should not be allowed to re-depose Sikorsky based on this update because they have already thoroughly deposed him. ( Id.) Plaintiffs assert that they were acting in good faith, and striking the supplemental declaration would be against the interests of justice because the Court would not consider the "correct" warranty claims data. ( Id.).
The Court must likewise consider this motion before reaching the merits of Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification.
G. Defendants' Motion to Strike Plaintiffs' Trial Expert Disclosures 
Defendants filed a Motion to Strike Plaintiffs' Trial Expert Disclosures on October 26, 2015. (Doc. 122). Defendants assert that Plaintiffs' disclosures are untimely and insufficient. Plaintiffs' trial expert disclosures were due on August 30, 2015; Defendants' trial expert disclosures were due on September 30, 2015; and discovery was scheduled to be completed by December 15, 2015. (Doc. 49). On August 24, 2015, Plaintiffs filed an unopposed motion for a sixty-day extension of time to submit the disclosures and to complete discovery (Doc. 113), which this Court denied without prejudice because the requested extensions would interfere with the scheduled final pre-trial conference and trial dates. (Doc. 118). Plaintiffs renewed their unopposed motion on September 18, 2015, asking for a fifty-day extension of the expert disclosure deadlines, discovery deadline, and dispositive motions deadline. (Doc. 120). This Court again denied the motion without prejudice, explaining that the proposed deadlines did not take into account the final pre-trial conference and trial dates. (Doc. 121). Plaintiffs did not file another motion seeking an extension of time.
On September 29, 2015, Plaintiffs emailed Defendants their purported trial expert disclosures, which amounted to a two-sentence letter attached to the email. (Doc. 122, Exhs. A, B). No other information accompanied this letter. Defendants responded on September 30, 2015, telling Plaintiffs that their trial expert disclosures were untimely and insufficient under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(2) . ( Id., Exh. C). Plaintiffs responded to Defendants on October 5, 2015, essentially asserting that the expert reports and documents submitted in connection with their Motion for Class Certification should be sufficient.4 ( Id., Exh. D). To date, Defendants have yet to serve their trial [*10] expert disclosures, because they assert that Plaintiffs have yet to serve their proper trial expert disclosures. ( Id. at 3 n.1).
Defendants move to strike these disclosures as untimely and insufficient, and argue that Plaintiffs cannot show their failure was substantially justified or harmless. In response, Plaintiffs argue that their expert disclosures on September 29, 2015 were sufficient because they informed Defendants that they would rely on the same two experts—Sikorsky and Bernatowicz—that they relied on in their Motion for Class Certification, both of whom have already been deposed by Defendants multiple times. (Doc. 123 at 2). They further assert that they offered to amend their disclosures, but Defendants rejected this idea. ( Id. at 4). Plaintiffs concede that their disclosures were untimely but argue that the sanctions requested by Defendants are "unreasonable, unnecessary, and unsupported given the complete lack of prejudice to Defendants." ( Id. at 3).
The Court will consider this motion last, as it concerns trial-related matters.
II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW 
A. Daubert Standard 
Federal Rule of Evidence 702 governs the admissibility of testimony by expert witnesses. The rule states that:
A witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if:
(a) the expert's scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue;
(b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;
(c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and
(d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.
Id . Rule 702 was amended in response to the Supreme Court's decision in Daubert, and to the many cases applying Daubert, including Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137 , 119 S. Ct. 1167 , 143 L. Ed. 2d 238 (1999). See United States v. Frazier, 387 F.3d 1244 , 1260 (11th Cir. 2004). Pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 104(a) , the proponent of the testimony has the burden of establishing its admissibility by a preponderance of the evidence. See Bourjaily v. United States, 483 U.S. 171 , 175-76 , 107 S. Ct. 2775 , 97 L. Ed. 2d 144 (1987); Frazier, 387 F.3d at 1260 .

The Eleventh Circuit explained in Frazier that "experts may be qualified in various ways," but that, fundamentally, the "'proposed expert testimony must be supported by appropriate validation.'" Frazier, 387 F.3d at 1260-61 (quoting Daubert, 509 U.S. at 590 ) (alterations omitted). When the expert's proposed testimony is scientific in nature, "the trial judge must assess 'whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid and . . . whether that reasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the facts at issue.'"  Id. at 1261-62 (quoting Daubert, 509 U.S. at 592-93 ). The Eleventh Circuit considers the following non-exhaustive factors when evaluating the reliability of scientific expert opinion:
(1) whether the expert's theory can be and has been tested; (2) whether the theory has been subjected to peer review and publication; (3) the known or potential rate of error of the particular scientific technique; and (4) whether the technique is generally accepted in the scientific community.
Id. at 1262 (quoting Quiet [*11] Tech. DC-8, Inc. v. Hurel-Dubois UK, Ltd., 326 F.3d 1333 , 1341 (11th Cir. 2003)). The Frazier Court went on to explain that "[s]ometimes the specific Daubert factors will aid in determining reliability; sometimes other questions may be more useful." Id . The trial judge has "considerable leeway" in deciding the reliability of expert testimony, but importantly, "what remains constant is the requirement that the trial judge evaluate the reliability of the testimony before allowing its admission at trial" in every case. Id . 

B. Class Certification Standard 
"'For a district court to certify a class action, the named plaintiffs must have standing, and the putative class must meet each of the requirements specified in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) , as well as at least one of the requirements set forth in Rule 23(b) .'" Vega v. T-Mobile USA, Inc., 564 F.3d 1256 , 1265 (11th Cir. 2009) (quoting Klay v. Humana, Inc., 382 F.3d 1241 , 1250 (11th Cir. 2004)). "'The burden of proof to establish the propriety of class certification rests with the advocate of the class.'" Id . (quoting Valley Drug Co. v. Geneva Pharms., Inc., 350 F.3d 1181 , 1187 (11th Cir. 2003)). The plaintiff "'must affirmatively demonstrate his compliance with Rule 23' by proving that the requirements are 'in fact' satisfied." Brown v. Electrolux Home Products, Inc., 817 F.3d 1225 , 2016 WL 1085517 , at *4 (11th Cir. 2016) (quoting Comcast Corp. v. Behrend, 133 S. Ct. 1426 , 1432 , 185 L. Ed. 2d 515 (2013)).
"'A district court must conduct a rigorous analysis of the rule 23 prerequisites before certifying a class.'" Vega, 564 F.3d at 1266 (quoting Castano v. Am. Tobacco Co., 84 F.3d 734 , 740 (5th Cir. 1996)). This analysis "'will frequently entail overlap with the merits of the plaintiff's underlying claim.'" Electrolux, 817 F.3d 1225 , 2016 WL 1085517 , at *4 (quoting Comcast, 133 S. Ct. at 1432 ). "'Although the trial court should not determine the merits of the plaintiffs' claim at the class certification stage, the trial court can and should consider the merits of the case to the degree necessary to determine whether the requirements of Rule 23 will be satisfied.'" Vega, 564 F.3d at 1266 (quoting Valley Drug, 350 F.3d at 1188 n.15). Accordingly, "if a question of fact or law is relevant to that determination, then the district court has a duty to actually decide it and not accept it as true or construe it in anyone's favor." Electrolux, 817 F.3d 1225 , 2016 WL 1085517 , at *4.
III. ANALYSIS 
A. Defendants' Motion to Exclude the Opinions of Paul J. Sikorsky (Doc. 88) 
As an initial matter, Defendants ask this Court to undertake a full Daubert analysis at the class certification stage, while Plaintiffs argue that a full Daubert analysis is improper and premature at this stage.
In Sher v. Raytheon Co., 419 F. App'x 887 (11th Cir. 2011), the Eleventh Circuit held that it was error for a district court to refuse to undertake a full Daubert analysis at the class certification stage when the situation warrants it.  Id. at 890 (citing Am. Honda Motor Co. v. Allen, 600 F.3d 813 , 816 (7th Cir. 2010)). "'[W]hen an expert's report or testimony is critical to class certification, . . . a district court must conclusively rule on any challenge to the expert's qualifications or submissions prior to ruling on a class certification motion.'" Id . (quoting Am. Honda, 600 F.3d at 815-16 ). This situation arises, for example, when the information that an expert provides "'is relevant to establishing any of the Rule 23 requirements.'" Id . (quoting Am. Honda, 600 F.3d at 816 ). The Eleventh Circuit explained that the district [*12] court "must make the necessary factual and legal inquiries and decide all relevant contested issues prior to certification."  Id. at 891 .
Plaintiffs nevertheless argue that a full Daubert analysis is not proper at this stage. They point out that Sher is an unpublished decision and thus not binding precedent. They also assert that Sher does not stand for the proposition that a full Daubert analysis is necessary in every case, but only if the situation warrants. They cite to In re Zurn Pex Plumbing Products Liability Litigation, 644 F.3d 604 (8th Cir. 2011), for support. There, the Eighth Circuit noted that "[c]lass certification is inherently tentative, and may require revisiting upon completion of full discovery."  Id. at 613 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Because "class certification decisions are generally made before the close of merits discovery, the court's analysis is necessarily prospective and subject to change." Id . The Eighth Circuit concluded that the district court did not err in conducting a "tailored" or "focused Daubert analysis which scrutinized the reliability of the expert testimony in light of the criteria for class certification and the current state of the evidence."  Id. at 614 .
The Court finds Zurn to be readily distinguishable from this case. In Zurn, the parties conducted bifurcated discovery, which resulted in a limited record at the class certification stage. The parties had not engaged in merits discovery, so there were necessarily "gaps in the available evidence," and "expert opinions may have [had] to adapt as such gaps [were] filled by merits discovery."  Id. at 612-13 . In this case, however, the parties did not engage in bifurcated discovery; merits discovery began immediately. Thus, there are no "gaps in the available evidence," as Sikorsky was provided with all of the documents produced by Goodman for merits discovery. Indeed, Plaintiffs attempt to argue that the record is still incomplete at the class certification stage, yet as noted in Part I.G. above, Plaintiffs also assert that the expert reports prepared for class certification may be used to satisfy their trial expert disclosure requirements. Even Sikorsky's supplemental declaration is not based on newly available data; it is based on data that was already produced by Goodman at the time Plaintiffs filed their class certification motion. Thus, the reasoning behind the "tailored" Daubert analysis in Zurn is not present here.
It is true that Sher is an unpublished Eleventh Circuit opinion and is not binding on this Court. Nevertheless, the Court finds Sherpersuasive and will conduct a full Daubert analysis in this case. Sikorsky's opinions are uniquely cited by Plaintiffs to support certain Rule 23 requirements, and the Court must determine whether these opinions are reliable.
1. Qualifications 
Sikorsky is objectively well qualified; he holds a bachelor's and master's degree in metallurgical engineering and has over 30 years of experience in the HVAC industry. (Doc. 76-6, ¶¶ 4-5). Sikorsky spent the majority of his career working at one [*13] of Defendants' competitors, Trane, as an engineer. ( Id. ¶ 5). He was involved in the selection of materials and manufacturing processes for the production of evaporator coils in residential and commercial air conditioning and heat pump products, and he also visited Trane manufacturing facilities to ensure compliance with such standards. ( Id. ¶ 6). He has extensive experience performing failure analyses on evaporator coils. ( Id.). He was also a member of the American Society for Testing and Materials, where he served on committees and helped to develop and publish nationwide industrial standards related to copper tubing and castings used in evaporator coils. ( Id. ¶ 7).
Defendants do not challenge Sikorsky's qualifications relating to analysis of copper evaporator coils and testing for formicary corrosion. Rather, Defendants argue that the test Sikorsky actually performed in this case is an unscientific and unreliable method, and thus, that the conclusions he reached therefrom are also unreliable. (Doc. 88 at 9-10, 17-20). They also argue that the conclusions he reached from the unscientific testing are not even supported by his own test. ( Id.). Defendants also challenge Sikorsky's qualifications and conclusions in relation to certain opinions he made that require correlation between data. ( Id. at 11-13, 16-17).
2. Sikorsky's Testing Method 
On January 29, 2015, Sikorsky visited a metallurgical testing laboratory in Dallas, Texas, to inspect 25 randomly-selected copper evaporator coils that had been returned under warranty from Florida. (Doc. 76-6, ¶ 26). They were subjected to a pressure decay leak test wherein the coils were pressurized with nitrogen to an initial pressure of 450 psi and then pressure decay was monitored for five minutes. ( Id.). Of the 25 coils tested, 21 (84%) exhibited a pressure decay of 1 psi or greater. ( Id. ¶ 27). Based on the small size and location of the leaks in the coils, Sikorsky concluded that the failures were consistent with formicary corrosion as a potential cause. ( Id.). He further concluded from the results of the test that the warranty claims rate of copper evaporator coils is at least roughly equivalent (if not exactly equivalent) to the coil failure rate of the 25 tested coils. ( Id. ¶ 28).
Defendants challenge Sikorsky's testing method and conclusions based thereon. First, they assert that Sikorsky's pressure decay leak test is inappropriate to test for formicary corrosion and is not used by the scientific community. Formicary corrosion is normally a slowly progressing, degenerative process, and they argue that a test of five minutes is not scientific. Second, they assert that an exhibited pressure decay of 1 psi or greater means nothing standing alone and is not supported by any scientific data or research. Defendants argue that Sikorsky arbitrarily chose this number.
In response, Plaintiffs argue that Sikorsky's test is reliable and scientific. They point to Sikorsky's extensive experience in this area, and to the fact that the exhibited leaks were located within the copper evaporator coils in areas that [*14] are usually indicative of formicary corrosion. In his declaration, Sikorsky notes that Goodman documents show that Goodman engineers have utilized a similar pressure decay leak test in the past. The main difference between the two tests is that Goodman held the coils at pressure for a longer period of time. Sikorsky asserts that this enables Goodman to find even smaller leaks than the leaks he found during his testing.
Sikorsky is correct to state that Goodman has performed similar testing in the past. For example, Goodman undertook testing of 34 coils returned from Winter Haven, Florida in October 2009. (Doc. 85-2 at 6, Exh. T). In that report, the testing method was written step by step:
Step 1: Note down the Model number and serial number.
Step 2: Visually looks at the coil for obvious defects.
Step 3: Pressurize the coil to 450 psi and introduce the coil in the gross leak chamber.
Step 4: Fill the coil with tracer gas and then pass it through the Sensistor Check.
Step 5: Fill the coil with 450 psi and dunk the coils and look for air bubbles.
Step 6: Pressurize the coil with tracer gas at 450 psi and then send the coil through the Sensistor check.
Step 7: If no defect is found then attach a pressure gauge to the coil (450 PSI) and closely monitor the coil for any pressure drop for 24, 48 [hours] and further more if still no issues were found. We keep the coils for 2 weeks before we deem the coil as good.
( Id. at 8). On this occasion, Goodman, like Sikorsky, pressurized the coils to 450 psi with tracer gas. In Goodman's test, if the coils did not exhibit a leak after several tests, including a test that looked for air bubbles, then the coils were again pressurized to 450 psi and were closely monitored for 24 to 48 hours or longer for any drop in pressure. It is possible that the test classified as "leaking" only those coils exhibiting a pressure drop of a certain psi or greater, but the report is silent on the matter. On its face, Sikorsky's testing is not inconsistent with Goodman's internal testing.

In the motion, Defendants note that Sikorsky could not identify an industry standard or any company in the HVAC industry that defines a leak as a 1 to 2 psi drop from 450 psi. (Doc. 89-1 at 140:2-10). Indeed, Sikorsky states in his declaration that a leak of 1 psi or greater is an indication, in his estimation, of a significant leak. (Doc. 76-6, ¶ 27). Sikorsky also concedes that he did not control for the presence of lubricant in returned coils, even though lubricant can absorb nitrogen test gas. (Doc. 89-1 at 139:5-14; Doc. 89-7, ¶ 11). If absorption of nitrogen occurred, this could decrease the pressure from 450 psi and falsely reflect a leak in the coil. (Doc. 89-7, ¶ 11).
Defendants' expert, Michael Stevenson ("Stevenson"), is also a well-qualified metallurgical engineer who consults in the HVAC industry and has over 13 years of experience in the field of metallurgical failure analysis. (Doc. 89-7, ¶ 2). He is the President of Engineering Systems, Inc. ("ESI"), a company that specializes in the performance and analysis of engineering materials and systems and conducts complex materials and metallurgical failure analysis. ([*15]  Id. at 15). The 25 coils tested by Sikorsky at ESI Dallas on January 29,2015 were jointly tested by ESI personnel. ( Id. ¶ 8). Including these 25 coils, ESI has tested 338 returned Goodman copper evaporator coils for formicary corrosion-related leaks. ( Id.). Stevenson argues that Sikorsky's test and conclusions are unscientific, unreliable, and based on flawed assumptions. ( Id. ¶¶ 6-8, 20-22).
The testing that ESI performed is slightly different than Sikorsky's testing. Stevenson first notes that industry standard requires pneumatic leak testing of pressure vessel tubes at a test pressure not less than 250 psi for five seconds, with leaks visually identified in conjunction with a pressure differential. ( Id. ¶ 6). In this case, ESI initially pressure tested each coil with nitrogen at 225 psi and held for a minimum of 15 seconds. ( Id.). If no gross leaks were discovered, the pressure was increased to 450 psi and held for five minutes. ( Id.). Stevenson states that this higher test pressure is conservative since it is approximately four to five times the operating pressure of an evaporator coil in cooling mode. ( Id.). Further, ESI classified as leaking only those coils exhibiting a pressure decay of 2 psi or greater due to (1) the duration of the test, (2) the higher test pressure relative to industry standards, and (3) potential, known causes of minor pressure fluctuations associated with the testing of used systems, such as mechanical damage or the presence of lubricants. ( Id.). This is different than Sikorsky's test, which classified as leaking an exhibited pressure decay of 1 psi or greater. Thus, the experts disagree on whether pressure drops between 1 and 2 psi should be classified as leaking or non-leaking.
Unfortunately, Stevenson's declaration does not provide ESI's results of the jointly-held testing of the 25 coils, and the Court is unable to determine whether classifying a leak at 1 or 2 psi makes a material difference in the test results. Stevenson's declaration does provide overall data for the 338 coils ESI tested, using the 2 psi or greater figure. ( Id. ¶ 8). Based on this criteria, ESI found that 224 of the 338 submitted coils tested, or 66%, did not exhibit a leak, and 47 of the coils, or 14%, exhibited no pressure decay at all. ( Id.). In other words, only 67 of the coils, or 20%, exhibited a leak of 2 psi or greater.
As noted above, lubricants on used coils can absorb nitrogen gas and lead to a drop in pressure unrelated to any leaks. ESI performed a secondary pressure test on selected copper coils that had exhibited a pressure decay during the first test to control for this possibility. ( Id. ¶ 11). Stevenson notes that in each instance where a second test was performed using the same criteria as the first test, the updated final pressure was always equal to or greater than the original final pressure. ( Id.). While this supports the conclusion that lubricant absorption of nitrogen accounted for the drop in pressure exhibited by some coils during the first test, Stevenson provides no figures or data related to the second test results. He does not state how many coils were subjected [*16] to a second test, and of these coils, how many exhibited an updated final pressure that was equal to the original final pressure and how many exhibited an updated final pressure that was greater than—and how much greater than—the original final pressure.
As previously noted, relevant factors in the Court's analysis of the reliability of scientific expert opinion consider whether the expert's theory can be and has been tested, whether it has been subjected to peer review and publication, the error rate of a particular scientific technique, and whether the technique is generally accepted in the scientific community. Frazier, 387 F.3d at 1262 .
The first test parameter that Defendants challenge is Sikorsky's decision to test the coils at 450 psi for five minutes. (Doc. 93 at 18-19). The Court does not have before it any scientific data or publications to support or refute testing at 450 psi for any specific length of time. It may be the case that this subject has not yet been subjected to peer review and publication. It is unclear whether testing at 450 psi is generally accepted in the scientific community based solely on the three anecdotal tests in this case (indeed, the industry standard simply states that testing should be performed at no less than 250 psi for five seconds). What the Court does know is that Sikorsky's test pressure level of 450 psi was also used by Goodman during internal testing, as well as by Defendants' expert Stevenson in this case. In Sikorsky's declaration, he notes that Goodman documentation shows that Goodman has utilized a similar pressure decay leak test in the past, and that Goodman's test is even more sensitive than Sikorsky's test because it is performed for a longer period of time at the same pressure level. (Doc. 76-6, ¶¶ 29-30). Thus, while it is true that objective scientific data or publications to support testing at 450 psi for five minutes is unavailable, the Court holds that there is sufficient anecdotal scientific evidence to support Sikorsky's test pressure level and duration. Sikorsky was, in essence, following test protocol Goodman has used in the past (and indeed, that Goodman also used in this litigation) by choosing to test for leaks at 450 psi. Sikorsky held the coils at pressure for five minutes, while Goodman would hold coils at pressure for 24 to 48 hours, or in some cases, up to two weeks. From this fact, Sikorsky makes the logical conclusion that Goodman has the capacity to find even smaller leaks. The Court finds this portion of Sikorsky's test reliable, as it is modeled on scientific testing that was previously performed by Goodman itself.
The other main parameter of Sikorsky's test that Defendants challenge relates to the classification of leaks. (Doc. 93 at 18-19). Sikorsky states that he personally chose to classify leaks at 1 psi or greater, based on his experience in the industry. (Doc. 76-6, ¶ 27). Defendants assert that this number is arbitrary and unscientific. While this may be true, it is worth noting that their expert likewise provides no independent scientific data or support for classifying a [*17] leak at 2 psi or greater. Stevenson describes various causes and factors in support of his conclusion that leaks should only qualify at 2 psi or greater, but the conclusion ultimately reached is his own. For example, the "correct" conservative figure that controls for all other causes may be at 3 psi or greater, or perhaps Sikorsky's metric sufficiently controls for all other causes. In theory this issue could be tested, but there is no evidence in the record that the theory has been tested or subjected to peer review and publication. Likewise, the error rate of this technique is unknown, as is whether the technique is generally accepted in the scientific community. What the Court is left with, then, is conflicting anecdotal evidence from Plaintiffs' expert and Defendants' expert, as well as evidence from Goodman's internal testing.
The question of whether this test parameter is scientific and reliable is a difficult one. As it is Plaintiffs' expert being challenged, Plaintiffs have the burden of establishing the admissibility of Sikorsky's expert opinion by a preponderance of the evidence; the burden is not on Defendants to disprove the admissibility of his opinion. Frazier, 387 F.3d at 1260 . The fact that the evidence submitted by the parties' competing experts is essentially in equipoise, therefore, does not act to undermine Sikorsky's opinion, but neither does it save Sikorsky's opinion.
Sikorsky's leak-classification test parameter is not based on established scientific principles, either objective or anecdotal. Sikorsky's opinion is based on his experience, and thus, the Court must evaluate whether his experience is enough. The Eleventh Circuit has approvingly cited the Advisory Committee's Note to the 2000 Amendments of Rule 702, which states:
"If the witness is relying solely or primarily on experience, then the witness must explain how that experience leads to the conclusion reached, why that experience is a sufficient basis for the opinion, and how that experience is reliably applied to the facts. The trial court's gatekeeping function requires more than simply taking the expert's word for it."
Frazier, 387 F.3d at 1261 (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 702 advisory committee's note (2000 amends.)). The Frazier court went on to explain that "[i]f admissibility could be established merely by the ipse dixit of an admittedly qualified expert, the reliability prong would be, for all practical purposes, subsumed by the qualification prong." Id . Expert testimony must be supported by "appropriate validation" that "'rests on a reliable foundation.'" Id . (quoting Daubert, 509 U.S. at 597 ).

Upon review of his declaration and his deposition, the Court finds that Sikorsky has not satisfied Frazier'sexperienced-based inquiry. Sikorsky states in his declaration that "21 [of the 25 coils tested] (84%) exhibited a pressure decay of 1 psi or greater, an indication, in my estimation, of a significant leak." (Doc. 76-6, ¶ 27). He provides no explanation in his declaration as to how his experience led him to choose this metric, let alone why his experience is a sufficient basis for choosing this metric and how his experience [*18] is reliably applied to the facts of this case. In his deposition, he conceded that he does not know of any company in the HVAC industry that classifies a one to two psi drop at 450 psi as a leak. (Doc. 89-1 at 140:2-10). He also conceded that it is possible to test the amount of absorption of nitrogen due to the presence of oils inside the coils, but he did not perform this test or control for this factor. ( Id. at 141:13-142:18). Sikorsky chose to classify leaks at 1 psi or greater not based on scientific testing, but rather, based on his experience. Sikorsky has failed to establish that his experience renders this portion of his opinion reliable. See, e.g., Lord v. Fairway Elec. Corp., 223 F. Supp. 2d 1270 , 1283-84 (M.D. Fla. 2002).
The fact that Sikorsky's leak-classification test metric is unscientific and unreliable further renders the test results obtained from this method unreliable. See Lord, 223 F. Supp. 2d at 1284 ("[T]his premise is not based upon sufficient facts or data, and the testimony is not the produce of reliable principles."). Using this unreliable parameter, Sikorsky found that 21 of the 25 coils (84%) exhibited a "significant leak." (Doc. 76-6, ¶ 27). This data is, therefore, unscientific and unreliable, as it is the result of an unreliable testing method.
3. Sikorsky's Conclusions and Opinions Based on the Test Results 
Defendants also take issue with the conclusions and opinions Sikorsky reached based on the test results. The Court finds that these conclusions and opinions are likewise unscientific and unreliable, as they are based on faulty data. Moreover, even if the testing method and results were reliable, Sikorsky's opinions and conclusions based thereon would still fail because they are not supported by Sikorsky's own data. After concluding that 84 percent of the tested coils had a significant leak, Sikorsky then concluded that "[t]he location of these leaks within the fin pack and the small size of these leaks is consistent with formicary corrosion as a potential cause." (Doc. 76-6, ¶ 27). Building on this assumption, Sikorsky further extrapolated the results from his test to Goodman's overall warranty claims data. He stated, "From these pressure tests it is clear the warranty claims rate is at least roughly equivalent (if not exactly equivalent) to the coil failure rate for these evaporator coils." ( Id. ¶ 28).
In a similar vein, Sikorsky also concluded that the warranty claims rate reflects coils that leaked due to formicary corrosion because (1) "the overwhelming failure mode reported for [returned] coils is refrigerant leakage;" (2) it appears from Goodman internal documentation that the primary cause of coil warranty claims was formicary corrosion; and (3) the "lengthy average time" between installation and warranty claim "suggests . . . failure due to a slowly progressing, degenerative process," and formicary corrosion "is such a process." ( Id. ¶¶ 16, 19). From there, Sikorsky infers that virtually all coils that were returned under warranty in fact leaked, and that all of these coils leaked due to formicary corrosion.
Sikorsky's opinion, then, is that (1) based on his testing of 25 coils, 84 percent exhibited leaks of 1 [*19] psi or greater, which qualifies as a significant leak; (2) the location of the leaks in the tested coils is consistent with formicary corrosion as the cause; (3) the results of his testing, when considered in conjunction with (a) internal Goodman documentation showing concern over formicary corrosion, (b) the main warranty claims rate failure mode being reported as refrigerant leakage, and (c) the average length of time between installation and warranty claim, support the conclusion that virtually all of the returned coils actually manifested a leak; and (4) the leaks in returned coils can be uniformly attributed to formicary corrosion.
This conclusion is important, because Defendants vehemently argue that the warranty claims rate cannot be used as a viable figure to determine the actual leakage rate of returned coils. Goodman does not independently test the vast majority of returned coils to verify that they leak; rather, it chooses to honor the warranty and send a new coil on nearly all claims. Goodman honors the warranty without independent verification as a method of doing business, even though it is undisputed that different repairmen have different diagnoses of the same problem and sometimes misdiagnose the problem, which Sikorsky conceded during his deposition. (Doc. 89-1 at 161:5-8). Marshall Blackham, Vice President of Quality for Goodman, explained in his declaration that Goodman undertakes an independent analysis of approximately three percent of all evaporator coil claims, and the most common result of this evaluation is that there is nothing wrong with the coil. (Doc. 89-2, ¶ 14). Thus, Defendants argue that it is impossible to determine the actual leakage rate of the copper evaporator coils, likewise making it impossible to tie the warranty claims rate to the leakage rate of coils caused by formicary corrosion. (Doc. 88 at 20).
The assumptions Sikorsky was required to make to form his opinion are unsupported by any available evidence. Furthermore, Sikorsky admitted during his deposition that he did not actually observe formicary corrosion in any of the coils that failed his leak test. (Doc. 89-1 at 31:14-24). He also could not testify to a reasonable degree of engineering certainty that the failure of the coils he tested was due to formicary corrosion as opposed to a different type of corrosion, such as pitting corrosion. ( Id. at 32:14-33:2). Even if Sikorsky's test and test results were reliable, Sikorsky's opinions based thereon are still unfounded. He provides no explanation apart from his experience in the HVAC industry to support the several assumptions he had to make in order to reach his ultimate conclusion: Goodman's warranty claims data may be used as evidence to demonstrate that Goodman's copper evaporator coils are uniformly defective due to a propensity to develop formicary corrosion and fail prematurely. These opinions must be excluded. See Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136 , 146 , 118 S. Ct. 512 , 139 L. Ed. 2d 508 (1997) ("Trained experts commonly extrapolate from existing data. But nothing in either Daubert or the Federal Rules of Evidence [*20] requires a district court to admit opinion evidence that is connected to existing data only by the ipse dixit of the expert. A court may conclude that there is simply too great an analytical gap between the data and the opinion proffered.").
4. Warranty Claims Rate Correlation 
Lastly, Defendants take issue with Sikorsky's opinion regarding the "correlation" between the warranty claims rate in any given year and evidence of a defect. (Doc. 88 at 11-13). Sikorsky opined in his declaration that, based on his experience in the industry, "warranty claims rates exceeding 1% for any year are excessive. The warranty claims rate of Goodman's copper evaporator coils shipped to Florida during the time frame of 2006 through 2014 is, in my opinion, high, and evidence of a defect in the design and/or manufacture of the product." (Doc. 76-6, ¶ 18).
Sikorsky offered no objective scientific documentation to support the one-percent figure, and he could not do so during his deposition. Indeed, he testified that he is "not aware of a particular standard" in the industry. (Doc. 89-1 at 161:23-162:8). The most he could say was that Trane would undertake a study if its warranty claims rate exceeded one percent; he could not say that Trane considered a rate exceeding one percent as evidence of a defect. ( Id. at 161:14-22). He also conceded that "corrosion failures were more ubiquitous in Florida than elsewhere." ( Id. at 163:1-4). When asked, "Yes, and that's largely because of the Florida environment; correct?" Sikorsky responded, "Yes." ( Id. at 163:5-8).
Sikorsky's opinion is again based solely on his experience. As the Eleventh Circuit made clear in Frazier, if a witness is relying solely or primarily on experience, the witness must come forward with an explanation of how his experience leads to the conclusion reached and why that experience is sufficient. Frazier, 387 F.3d at 1261 . The expert must also explain how his experience is reliably applied to the facts. Id . Sikorsky did not do so here; he rests his opinion on the conclusory reference to his experience and nothing more. Accordingly, Sikorsky's opinion on this issue must be excluded.5 
5. Conclusion 
Sikorsky's expert opinions in this case are based solely or primarily on his experience. While he is undoubtedly well qualified to testify as an expert in metallurgical engineering, his testing method and conclusions based thereon are not supported by objective scientific data or analysis. In addition, Sikorsky's opinion regarding the correlation between the warranty claims rate for each year and evidence of a defect is unsupported by either reference to established industry standards or scientific analysis. Sikorsky's opinions are unreliable and must be excluded at the present time.
That being said, the Court recognizes that Sikorsky's opinions were not prepared for trial; they were prepared in support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification. It is also worth noting that the Court did not conduct a Daubert hearing before ruling on the motion. It is implausible, yet theoretically possible, that Sikorsky could revise his declaration and [*21] correct its deficiencies in preparation for trial. Therefore, the Court will proceed to analyze the merits of Plaintiffs' motion for class certification, leaving the original arguments and evidence of the parties intact, while recognizing that class certification could likely be denied based on the exclusion of Sikorsky's opinions.
B. Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification (Doc. 76) 
For a district court to certify a class action, the party seeking certification must demonstrate compliance with the requirements of Rule 23(a) , as well as at least one of the requirements of Rule 23(b) . Vega, 564 F.3d at 1265 . Rule 23(a) requires:
(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable;
(2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class;
(3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and
(4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) . These requirements are routinely referenced as "numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation." Valley Drug, 350 F.3d at 1188 . The plaintiff must also establish at least one of the requirements of Rule 23(b) . See id . Failure to establish any one of the four requirements of Rule 23(a) and at least one of the alternative requirements of Rule 23(b) precludes class certification. Id . 

Plaintiffs seek to certify two classes: a damages class ("the damages class") pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3) , and an injunctive and declaratory relief class ("the injunctive relief class") pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) . Rule 23(b)(3) permits class certification if "the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy." Id . Rule 23(b)(2) permits class certification if "the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole." Id . Plaintiffs' proposed damages class under Rule 23(b)(3) is defined as:
All individuals and entities in the State of Florida that own or owned real property in which a Goodman Unit (under the Goodman or Amana brand names) containing copper evaporator coil was installed from July 1, 2006 to the present and who suffered damages as a result of having to repair and/or replace their Goodman Products due to leakage of refrigerant.
(Doc. 76 at 12). Plaintiffs' proposed injunctive relief class under Rule 23(b)(2) is defined as:
All individuals and entities in the State of Florida that own real property in which a Goodman Unit (under the Goodman or Amana brand names) containing copper evaporator coil was installed from July 1, 2006 to the present.
( Id.). In order to analyze the sufficiency of Plaintiffs' proposed classes, it is first necessary to clearly articulate Plaintiffs' claims and their elements. Two causes of action remain from the FCCAC, and Plaintiffs' proposed [*22] classes seek to encompass those individuals who would be able to assert the same claims if brought individually. Count One is a breach of express warranty claim based on the theory of unconscionability, and Count Two is an FDUTPA claim.

As a condition precedent to recovery for breach of express warranty, a buyer must notify the seller of the breach "within a reasonable time after he or she discovers or should have discovered any breach." Fla. Stat. § 672.607(3)(a) . "Where the buyer gives some notice of the breach, the issues of timeliness and sufficiency are questions of fact." Royal Typewriter Co., a Div. of Litton Bus. Sys., Inc. v. Xerographic Supplies Corp., 719 F.2d 1092 , 1102 (11th Cir. 1983). If the notice requirement has been met, the plaintiff (buyer) must then demonstrate that the warranty limitation is unconscionable and, therefore, unenforceable. Under Florida law, a warranty limitation may be unconscionable when a defect is latent and the manufacturer knows that the product's effectiveness is questionable. See Monsanto Agric. Prods. Co. v. Edenfield, 426 So. 2d 574 , 579 (Fla. 1st DCA 1982); Barnext Offshore, Ltd. v. Ferretti Grp. USA, Inc., No. 10-23869-CIV, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 61710 , [2012 BL 109064], 2012 WL 1570057 , at *10 (S.D. Fla. May 2, 2012) ("[I]f a product contains a known latent defect then any warranty limits may be unconscionable."). A plaintiff must prove both substantive and procedural unconscionability. Pendergast v. Sprint Nextel Corp., 592 F.3d 1119 , 1134 (11th Cir. 2010).
To determine substantive unconscionability, Florida courts asks whether the terms of the warranty are "unreasonable and unfair." Pendergast, 592 F.3d at 1139 . This analysis "focuses 'directly on those terms of the contract itself which amount to an outrageous degree of unfairness to the same contracting party.'" Id . (quoting Steinhardt v. Rudolph, 422 So. 2d 884 , 889 (Fla. 3d DCA 1982)). Substantive unconscionability is generally defined "in reference to an agreement no man in his senses and not under delusion would make on the one hand, and as no honest and fair man would accept on the other.'" Id . (quoting Belcher v. Kier, 558 So. 2d 1039 , 1044 (Fla. 2d DCA 1990)). Procedural unconscionability asks "whether the consumer has an absence of meaningful choice in whether to accept the contract terms."  Id. at 1135 . Florida courts consider:
(1) the manner in which the contract was entered into; (2) the relative bargaining power of the parties and whether the complaining party had a meaningful choice at the time the contract was entered into; (3) whether the terms were merely presented on a "take-it-or-leave-it" basis; and (4) the complaining party's ability and opportunity to understand the disputed terms of the contract.
Id . (citing Powertel, Inc. v. Bexley, 743 So. 2d 570 , 574 (Fla. 1st DCA 1999)). The last element of a claim for breach of express warranty is injury; the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defect has manifested in the product and thereby caused the plaintiff to suffer an injury. See, e.g., Kia Motors Am. Corp. v. Butler, 985 So. 2d 1133 , 1138-39 (Fla. 3d DCA 2008) (holding, as an independent reason to reverse the trial court and deny class certification in an automobile brake defect case asserting breach of express warranty and FDUTPA claims, that the class representative improperly sought "compensation not only for class members whose brakes [*23] have manifested a deficiency, but also for those whose brakes have performed satisfactorily").

The FDUTPA allows "civil private causes of action for both declaratory and injunctive relief and for damages." Rollins, Inc. v. Butland, 951 So. 2d 860 , 869 (Fla. 2d DCA 2006); see Fla. Stat. § 501.211 . To state a claim for damages under the FDUTPA, a plaintiff must show: "(1) a deceptive act or unfair practice; (2) causation; and (3) actual damages." Kia Motors, 985 So. 2d at 1140 . "A deceptive practice is one that is 'likely to mislead' consumers." Rollins, 951 So. 2d at 869 (quoting Davis v. Powertel, Inc., 776 So. 2d 971 , 974 (Fla. 1st DCA 2000)). Courts have described an unfair practice as "'one that offends established public policy and one that is immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers.'" Id . (quoting Samuels v. King Motor Co. of Fort Lauderdale, 782 So. 2d 489 , 499 (Fla. 4th DCA 2001)). To demonstrate causation, a plaintiff need not plead actual, subjective reliance on the alleged misrepresentation or omission. See, e.g., Fitzpatrick v. Gen. Mills, Inc., 635 F.3d 1279 , 1282-83 (11th Cir. 2011) (reviewing FDUTPA claim); State, Office of Att'y Gen., Dep't of Legal Affairs v. Commerce Commercial, LLC, 946 So. 2d 1253 , 1258 (Fla. 1st DCA 2007) ("A deceptive or unfair trade practice constitutes a somewhat unique tortious act because, although it is similar to a claim of fraud, it is different in that, unlike fraud, a party asserting a deceptive trade practice claim need not show actual reliance on the representation or omission at issue." (citation omitted)). Rather, causation under the FDUTPA considers "whether the alleged practice was likely to deceive a consumer acting reasonably in the same circumstances." Commerce Commercial, 946 So. 2d at 1258 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
Lastly, the FDUTPA limits damages to "actual damages," which do not include consequential damages. Rollins, 951 So. 2d at 869 . "The measure of actual damages is the difference in the market value of the product or service in the condition in which it was delivered and its market value in the condition in which it should have been delivered according to the contract of the parties." Id . (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
Defendants raise various challenges to Plaintiffs' proposed classes. Specifically, Defendants argue that (1) neither class is readily ascertainable without being impermissibly overbroad; (2) individual questions overwhelm any common questions under Rule 23(a)(2) for both the breach of warranty claim and the FDUTPA claim; (3) the named Plaintiffs are not typical and cannot adequately represent the class under Rule 23(a)(3) and (a)(4) ; (4) individual questions predominate over any common questions as to the damages class under Rule 23(b)(3) ; (5) Plaintiffs' proposed damages models do not satisfactorily measure only those damages attributable to Plaintiffs' theory of liability; and (6) the injunctive relief class is impermissibly seeking individualized damages. (Doc. 89). The Court will consider each argument in turn.
1. Adequacy of Proposed Class Definitions 
An implied prerequisite of Rule 23 is that the proposed class must be "adequately defined and clearly ascertainable." Little v. T-Mobile USA, Inc., 691 F.3d 1302 , 1304 (11th Cir. 2012) (citation and internal [*24] quotation marks omitted). A proposed class that is overbroad is impermissible. See, e.g., Bussey v. Macon Cty. Greyhound Park, Inc., 562 F. App'x 782 , 788 (11th Cir. 2014); Walewski v. Zenimax Media, Inc., 502 F. App'x 857 , 861 (11th Cir. 2012). "An identifiable class exists if its members can be ascertained by reference to objective criteria." Bussey, 562 F. App'x at 787 (citation omitted). This should be an "administratively feasible" task, meaning "that identifying class members is a manageable process that does not require much, if any, individual inquiry."  Id. at 787-88 (citation omitted).
In this case, Plaintiffs define the damages class as including all individuals who own or owned real property in Florida in which a Goodman product containing a copper evaporator coil was installed from July 1, 2006 to present and who subsequently suffered damages from the leakage of refrigerant. Defendants argue that this class is impermissibly overbroad because it encompasses all individuals whose Goodman product experienced refrigerant leaks for any reason; it is not limited to those individuals whose systems experienced refrigerant leaks due to formicary corrosion in the copper evaporator coil. (Doc. 89 at 20). Further, Defendants argue there is no evidence in existence that could limit the class to only those who experienced leaks due to formicary corrosion, so the proposed class cannot be objectively ascertained.
In response, Plaintiffs point out that ascertainability at the class certification stage does not require that a plaintiff actually identify all class members, but rather, it only requires a plaintiff to demonstrate that class members can be identified in reference to objective criteria. See, e.g., Bush v. Calloway Consol. Grp. River City, Inc., No. 3:10-CV-841-J-37MCR, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40450 , [2012 BL 85128], 2012 WL 1016871 , at *4 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 26, 2012) (citations omitted). And, in contrast to Defendants' assertion, Plaintiffs believe that class members can be readily ascertained. Plaintiffs cite to Goodman's warranty database, which contains information concerning model numbers, serial numbers, and dates of installation for consumers. Goodman maintains records when it provides a replacement coil to consumers, and the consumers' identities can be obtained from Goodman's contractors and dealers. Plaintiffs assert that class members can also submit invoices or other evidence showing they paid to have their coil replaced. (Doc. 110 at 7).
In Plaintiffs' reply brief, they reinforce the argument that the class definition is properly composed of all those who suffered damages due to leakage of refrigerant. Plaintiffs make no attempt to narrow the class to those who suffered damages due to formicary corrosion-related leaks. Indeed, Plaintiffs assert that they need not determine why each potential class member's coil leaked, because the reason why each coil leaked is neither relevant to the FDUTPA claim nor to the breach of express warranty claim. (Doc. 110 at 8).
Plaintiffs' exclusive theory of liability in this case is that Goodman's copper evaporator coils possess a design and/or manufacturing defect that causes the coils to develop formicary corrosion [*25] and fail prematurely. The class definitions must match Plaintiffs' theory of liability for each cause of action. See, e.g., Fitzpatrick v. Gen. Mills, Inc., 635 F.3d 1279 , 1283 (11th Cir. 2011) ("While we agree with the legal analysis of the district court, because the definition of the class it certified was in conflict with that analysis, we are uncertain of exactly what class it intended to certify."). Contrary to Plaintiffs' assertion, the breach of express warranty claim requires Plaintiffs to (1) demonstrate that each class member's coil actually experienced a leakage of refrigerant, and (2) that this leak was due to the alleged defect—formicary corrosion. In other words, this claim requires the defect to manifest. If the defect has not manifested or a consumer has experienced refrigerant leakage for another reason, then a consumer has suffered no injury based on the theory of liability in this case and is not entitled to recovery as a member of the class. See, e.g., Kia Motors, 985 So. 2d at 1140 ("Without individual inquiry, there is no way in adjudicating this case to determine whether the need for a particular repair was based on normal wear, a defective original part, . . . environmental factors, such as weather . . ., the presence of foreign objects in the braking system, the failure of parts other than the braking system, poor workmanship by a third party, or individual . . . habits.").
Defendants take great issue with Plaintiffs' attempt to equate the "number of warranty claims on copper coils" to the "actual leakage of refrigerant" to the "actual leakage of refrigerant due to formicary corrosion." Defendants argue that this conclusion is entirely unsupported by the evidence, which results in an impermissibly overbroad class that cannot be narrowed. Defendants assert that (1) contractors regularly misdiagnose problems, so not all returned coils even exhibited a leak, and (2) many of the returned coils that did exhibit leaks had leaks that were not caused by formicary corrosion, but were caused by other issues. Indeed, even Plaintiffs' expert notes that copper evaporator coils can and do fail for a wide variety of reasons. (Doc. 76-6, ¶ 19). Sikorsky does state that problems due to installation errors or mechanical failures are typically manifested a short time after installation, but he also did not review Goodman warranty claims data to support this statement. (Doc. 89-1 at 147:9-152:3).
Further, Goodman has a policy and practice of accepting nearly all warranty claims without conducting independent testing to verify each claim's validity. Goodman says it tested a small subset (3%) of the returned coils, and even within this subset, not all coils exhibited leaks, and those coils that did exhibit leaks did not uniformly do so due to formicary corrosion. (Doc. 89-2, ¶ 14). For example, in October 2009, Goodman undertook internal testing of 34 copper evaporator coils that were returned from Winter Haven, Florida. (Doc. 85-2 at 3, Exh. S). Testing demonstrated that 19 of the 34 coils (56%) had leaks indicative of formicary corrosion; 11 of the 34 coils (32%) contained no leaks and were considered good coils; 2 of the 34 coils ([*26] 6%) were damaged possibly by the installer; and 2 of the 34 coils (6%) had leaks that were not indicative of formicary corrosion. ( Id.). Thus, while all of the warranty claims in this testing group were submitted as "leaking evaporator coils" and new replacement coils were sent to customers, 38 percent of the returned coils were found not defective or were damaged by improper handling. ( Id.). The official report on this particular test notes that "formicary corrosion has been the major reason for failure on the returned coils." (Doc. 85-2 at 6, Exh. T). This may be true, as demonstrated by the fact that 56 percent of the coils tested on this occasion exhibited formicary corrosion. However, it also demonstrates that a substantial number of coils returned with a reported failure mode of "leaking refrigerant" either did not contain any leaks or exhibited leaks caused by other issues.
In response, Plaintiffs assert that "the argument that some members did not experience the problem is no reason to deny class certification." (Doc. 110 at 12). They cite to Butler v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 727 F.3d 796 , 799 (7th Cir. 2013), to support this assertion. In Butler, Sears argued that most of the members of the damages class had not experienced any mold problems in their washing machines, and the court held that this was not an impediment to class certification. Id . Whatever the reasoning of the Butler court, it is not applicable here. Florida courts have clearly held that manifestation of a defect is required to maintain a claim for breach of warranty, either privately or on behalf of a class, and the Court must apply Florida law. See, e.g., Kia Motors, 985 So. 2d at 1138-39 . The class must be limited to those individuals who suffered damages caused by the leakage of refrigerant caused by Goodman's allegedly defective copper evaporator coils, and the leaks in the coils must be caused by formicary corrosion.
It is impossible to see how Plaintiffs can identify class members in reference to objective criteria. Even if the Court were to conclude that the class is properly defined as including instances of all refrigerant leaks (which it does not), the class definition would still be overbroad because Plaintiffs attempt to equate warranty claims rates to actual leakage rates. The Winter Haven testing sample described above demonstrates the overbreadth of this definition, as 32 percent of those coils tested did not exhibit any leaks. At this stage, ascertainability does not require a plaintiff to actually identify all class members, yet it does require a plaintiff to demonstrate that class members can be identified in reference to objective criteria. See, e.g., Bush, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40450 , [2012 BL 85128], 2012 WL 1016871 , at *4. In this case, Plaintiffs have not demonstrated, and the Court has not independently discovered, any objective criteria that would make it possible for class members to be properly identified for purposes of Plaintiffs' breach of express warranty claim for both the proposed damages class and the injunctive relief class.
As to Plaintiffs' FDUTPA claim, Defendants assert that the proposed classes are overbroad because they could include [*27] persons who were not exposed to Defendants' alleged deception and/or who did not rely on such deception. (Doc. 89 at 28). Throughout their filings, Defendants assert that actual reliance is a necessary element of an FDUTPA claim, while Plaintiffs assert that actual reliance is not. The Court explained above that Plaintiffs are correct and Florida law does not require a plaintiff to demonstrate actual, subjective reliance to assert a violation of the FDUTPA. See, e.g., Zlotnick v. Premier Sales Grp., 480 F.3d 1281 , 1284 (11th Cir. 2007) ("The Florida Supreme Court has noted that 'deception occurs if there is a representation, omission, or practice that is likely to mislead the consumer acting reasonably in the circumstances, to the consumer's detriment.'"). To prove deception on a classwide basis, Plaintiffs must still demonstrate exposure to the same misrepresentations or omissions, however, and they wholly fail to explain how they would be able to narrow both the damages class and the injunctive relief class to account for this. See, e.g., James D. Hinson Elec. Contracting Co. v. BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., 275 F.R.D. 638 , 645-46 (M.D. Fla. 2011); Egwuatu v. South Lubes, Inc., 976 So. 2d 50 , 52-54 (Fla. 1st DCA 2008).
The damages class definition is untenable for purposes of Plaintiffs' FDUTPA claim for an additional reason, as well. The damages class limits membership to consumers who were damaged by having to pay to repair or replace their Goodman products due to leakage of refrigerant. However, FDUTPA claims are limited to "actual damages," and actual damages "do not include consequential damages, such as repair damages or resale damages." Kia Motors, 985 So. 2d at 1140 .
The proposed damages class and the proposed injunctive relief class are not ascertainable for purposes of the either the breach of warranty claim or the FDUTPA claim. Rather than undertake to redefine the class definitions, however, the Court will proceed to analyze the remaining requirements of Rule 23(a) and (b) . As will be seen below, any amendment to the class definition would be futile.
2. Rule 23(a) Requirements 
Plaintiffs must also satisfy the four requirements of Rule 23(a) . "Under Rule 23(a), every putative class first must satisfy the prerequisites of 'numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation.'" Vega, 564 F.3d at 1265 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) ).
a. Numerosity 
Plaintiffs must demonstrate that "the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable." Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1) . "[W]hile there is no fixed numerosity rule, generally less than twenty-one is inadequate, more than forty adequate, with numbers between varying according to other factors." Cox v. Am. Cast Iron Pipe Co., 784 F.2d 1546 , 1553 (11th Cir. 1986) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In this case, Goodman appears to concede that the numerosity requirement has been met. From 2006 through 2014, Goodman shipped a total of 540,581 copper evaporator coils into the State of Florida, and these coils were designed and manufactured consistently. (Doc. 76 at 17-18). This number does not reflect the number of potential class members who own or owned real property in Florida in which a Goodman product was installed, which would necessarily [*28] be a lower number. This number likewise does not reflect the number of consumers in Florida who actually experienced formicary corrosion-related leaks, which would further decrease the number. Nevertheless, it is clear from this figure that the numerosity requirement has been met, as the proposed classes would still likely be in the thousands.
b. Commonality 
Commonality requires that "there are questions of law or fact common to the class." Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2) . To satisfy commonality, Rule 23 "'does not require that all the questions of law and fact raised by the dispute be common,' or that the common questions of law or fact 'predominate' over individual issues." Vega, 564 F.3d at 1268 (quoting Cox, 784 F.2d at 1557 ). Individual differences concerning treatment or damages will not generally defeat a finding of commonality; it "may be established where there are allegations of common conduct or standardized conduct by the defendant directed toward members of the proposed class." Strube v. Am. Equity Inv. Life Ins. Co., 226 F.R.D. 688 , 695 (M.D. Fla. 2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The Supreme Court has explained that "[c]ommonality requires the plaintiff to demonstrate that the class members have suffered the same injury." Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338 , 349-50 , 131 S. Ct. 2541 , 180 L. Ed. 2d 374 (2011). The focus is not on the "raising of common questions—even in droves—but, rather the capacity of a classwide proceeding to generate common answers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation."  Id. at 350 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
Plaintiffs assert that commonality has been satisfied because there are several issues of law or fact that are common to the class. They allege that some common questions at issue in this case are whether (1) Goodman's copper evaporator coils have a propensity to develop formicary corrosion and prematurely fail; (2) Goodman had knowledge that its coils have a propensity to develop formicary corrosion and prematurely fail; and (3) Goodman's omission of this material fact was likely to deceive a consumer acting reasonably in the circumstances. (Doc. 76 at 19). They assert that "the ultimate question of liability is whether Goodman knowingly sold units that contained defective evaporator coils." (Doc. 107 at 13).
In response, Defendants argue that none of Plaintiffs' allegedly common questions is common. They assert that even if Plaintiffs could show that Goodman copper evaporator coils have a "propensity to develop formicary corrosion and prematurely fail," or that Goodman knew of such propensity, that still does not answer the question of whether and why any particular coil leaked. (Doc. 94 at 28). They also argue that individual questions related to exposure and reliance on Defendants' allegedly deceptive marketing materials are not common for purposes of Plaintiffs' FDUTPA claim.
As will be discussed in the predominance section below, whether Goodman's copper evaporator coils have a uniform defect is a common question, but it does not produce a common answer, which is the main focus of the commonality inquiry. Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 350 . However, whether Defendants had knowledge of an alleged defect [*29] is a common question that will produce a common answer. And in the absence of a requirement of reliance, the question of whether Defendants' omission of an alleged defect would likely deceive a consumer acting reasonably in the circumstances is also able to produce a common answer. "These common questions are sufficient to satisfy the low hurdle of Rule 23(a)(2) ." Williams v. Mohawk Indus., 568 F.3d 1350 , 1356 (11th Cir. 2009). Importantly, whether or not common questions of law or fact exist is a separate inquiry from whether common or individual questions of law or fact predominate the case. The Court holds that commonality has been satisfied in this case for both the damages class and the injunctive relief class for both causes of action. See Strube, 226 F.R.D. at 695 .
c. Typicality 
Typicality requires that "the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class." Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3) . Typicality is satisfied where the claims or defenses of the class representative and the class arise from the same event or pattern of practice and are based on the same legal theory. Kornberg v. Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc., 741 F.2d 1332 , 1337 (11th Cir. 1984). Importantly, "the class representative must have the same interest and suffer the same injury as the class members." Rosario-Guerrero v. Orange Blossom Harvesting, Inc., 265 F.R.D. 619 , 627 (M.D. Fla. 2010) (citing Busby v. JRHBW Realty, Inc., 513 F.3d 1314 , 1322 (11th Cir. 2008)). "The typicality requirement is generally met if the class representative and the class members received the same unlawful conduct, irrespective of whether the fact patterns that underlie each claim vary." Id . It is a "permissive" requirement, and "representative claims are 'typical' if they are reasonably co-extensive with those of absent class members; they need not be substantially identical." Alhassid v. Bank of Am., N.A., 307 F.R.D. 684 , 697 (S.D. Fla. 2015) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
The details related to the named Plaintiffs in this class are recited supra, Part I.B.1-4. Defendants focus on the individual factual differences of each named Plaintiffs claims, but as noted, the primary focus is on the similarity of the named Plaintiffs' interest and injury to that of the class, as well as the similarity of Defendants' conduct received by the named Plaintiffs and the class.
i. Standing of PB Property 
Defendants assert that PB Property cannot be a class representative because it lacks standing. (Doc. 89 at 31). Defendants allege that PB Property did not purchase the Goodman products at issue, does not own the properties where those products are located, is not a party to the applicable warranties, and paid no replacement costs. Defendants cite to the deposition of Mr. Mansouri, the owner of PB Property, in support. (Doc. 89-4 at 70:23-75:19).
In response, Plaintiffs note that an agent "who acted as an agent during the course of a transaction involved in the litigation, may sue for damages suffered by the principal." Global Aerospace, Inc. v. Platinum Jet Mgmt., LLC, 488 F. App'x 338 , 340 (11th Cir. 2012) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Not only is Mr. Mansouri the owner of PB Property, he is also the principal of various entities that owned [*30] the properties in which the Goodman products were installed. (Doc. 107-6 at 24:8-11). It is also false that PB Property paid no replacement costs, as Mr. Mansouri testified that on at least one occasion, he paid for the repair costs related to a leaking evaporator coil. ( Id. at 66:10-24). The Court finds that PB Property has standing to sue in this case.
ii. Breach of Warranty 
Defendants argue that none of the named Plaintiffs' interests are typical of the interests of the class because breach of warranty claimants must show that the allege defect manifested and caused the injury, and the named Plaintiffs cannot prove manifestation and causation as to their individual claims. (Doc. 89 at 31). Defendants allege that they would have unique defenses as to each named Plaintiff, as there is no evidence showing that any of the named Plaintiffs' coils failed due to formicary corrosion. Accordingly, Defendants assert that the named Plaintiffs cannot be typical class representatives of any class members whose coils did in fact fail due to formicary corrosion. Defendants further argue that there can be no typical representative plaintiff with regards to manifestation of defect and causation in this case, because these issues inherently require individual inquiries and defenses.
By contrast, Plaintiffs focus their typicality argument on demonstrating that each named Plaintiff purchased a Goodman product, experienced leakage of refrigerant and other issues caused by problems with the copper evaporator coil, and incurred damages as a result of having to pay for labor and refrigerant relating to coil repairs and replacements. (Doc. 76 at 21). Thus, Plaintiffs argue that their claims are typical of the claims of the class, because they and all other class members own or owned Goodman products with defective copper evaporator coils and were subjected to the same unlawful conduct.
Both parties' arguments touch upon the merits of the Plaintiffs' claim for breach of express warranty; the Court is required to analyze the merits to the extent necessary to rule on the availability of class certification. The fundamental question when considering typicality is whether the named Plaintiffs have the same interest and suffered the same injury as the rest of the class. The underlying facts related to each plaintiff need not be identical; only the "essential characteristics" need to be the same. See Rosario-Guerrero, 265 F.R.D. at 627 . In this case, the named Plaintiffs all share a common interest—they all own or owned a Goodman product with a copper evaporator coil—with the rest of the class. Further, the named Plaintiffs all suffered a similar injury—they all experienced leakage of refrigerant from their Goodman product and incurred out-of-pocket expenses for labor to replace lost refrigerant and to repair and replace the copper evaporator coil—as the rest of the class. It is true that the named Plaintiffs will need to prove that the copper evaporator coils were uniformly defective and that this defect caused their injury, and that Defendants [*31] will assert unique affirmative defenses against each plaintiff based on unique underlying factual circumstances. Nevertheless, the Court finds that the named Plaintiffs' claims for breach of express warranty are sufficiently typical of the claims of the class.
iii. FDUTPA 
Defendants argue that the named Plaintiffs are not typical representatives for purposes of their FDUTPA claim. They assert that most of the named Plaintiffs never saw, let alone relied on, any statement by Goodman in deciding to purchase a Goodman product. (Doc. 89 at 33). Moreover, Defendants note that Plaintiffs certainly did not rely on the same material as one another and the numerous putative class members.
As has already been explained, a plaintiff need not demonstrate actual reliance on an alleged misrepresentation or omission to bring a claim under the FDUTPA. Plaintiffs allege that they are typical representatives of the class because they are not required to prove that they relied on any representation by Goodman or even that Goodman had knowledge of a deceptive practice. See, e.g., Gavron v. Weather Shield Mfg., Inc., 819 F. Supp. 2d 1297 , 1301-02 (S.D. Fla. 2011) (reviewing cases). Rather, Plaintiffs assert that "deception occurs if there is a representation, omission, or practice that is likely to mislead the consumer acting reasonably in the circumstances, to the consumer's detriment." PNR, Inc. v. Beacon Prop. Mgmt., Inc., 842 So. 2d 773 , 777 (Fla. 2003) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
Plaintiffs are correct that they need not demonstrate subjective reliance or Defendants' knowledge of a deceptive practice. However, Defendants do have a point regarding the issue of exposure to the same allegedly deceptive materials for purposes of class certification. In FDUTPA cases, courts usually focus their analysis on the issue of reliance on an alleged misrepresentation and do not consider the issue of exposure to different representations. What can be synthesized from various cases analyzing the FDUTPA is that exposure to the same deceptive practice can play an important part of the class action analysis. See, e.g., James D. Hinson, 275 F.R.D. at 645 . The test asks what a reasonable consumer would do in the same circumstances; this requirement relates to Plaintiffs' ability to prove the element of deception on a classwide basis. See id . In Pop's Pancakes, Inc. v. NuCO2, Inc., 251 F.R.D. 677 (S.D. Fla. 2008), the district court explained that the plaintiffs did not satisfy typicality because
the representations made to them before receiving the property tax involve, and after receiving the invoice are different from other class members, and thus the fact that one of the named Plaintiffs may be able to prove its case, would not necessarily establish the elements necessary to prove the other class members' cases, specifically whether the property invoice was deceptive.
Id. at 683 . The court went on to say that "it is not the Plaintiffs' reliance that is the issue, but whether it was reasonable under the circumstances, which vary for each Plaintiff."  Id. at 686 . In other words, the representations made to each plaintiff differed; [*32] even when reviewing each representation by an objective standard, the issue remained that a representation made to one plaintiff could be found to be deceptive, while a different representation made to another plaintiff could be found not to be deceptive.

This issue is further underscored by reference to two Florida First District Court of Appeal decisions. In Powertel, the defendant had been selling brand name cell phones without disclosing the fact that the phones had been modified to render them inoperable with any other cellular service provider. Powertel, 776 So. 2d at 972-73 . The plaintiffs sought relief under the FDUTPA, alleging that this nondisclosure had reduced the value of the phone in each case.  Id. at 973 . On appeal, the First DCA held that a showing of individual reliance by a consumer is not a necessary element under the FDUTPA.  Id. at 974 . The court explained that the proposed class could be certified as a class action because "[a]ll of the claims shared one essential common feature; that is, the alleged [deceptive] practice reduced the value of the telephones."  Id. at 975 .
The First DCA clarified its holding in Powertel seven years later. In Egwuatu, the court considered whether class certification was appropriate as to a consumer's claim that the defendant violated the FDUTPA by charging a tax it was collecting from consumers when purchasing an oil change by deceptively labeling the tax as an "environmental fee." Egwuatu, 976 So. 2d at 51 . The court explained that "[t]he absence of the element of reliance . . . does not guarantee that a deceptive trade practice claim will be amenable to class litigation. There might be many other reasons why class certification would be inappropriate."  Id. at 53 . One such reason, which was upheld by the appellate court, was that "there would be many differences in the facts supporting the claims of the individual plaintiffs. This conclusion was based on the fact that the defendants have employed a variety of methods over the years to inform customers that the environmental fee was not a tax." Id . The different representations made to different plaintiffs over the years precluded class certification because individual inquiries would be necessary as to deception. Egwuatu is distinguishable from Powertel because Powertel involved all plaintiffs being exposed to the same deceptive practice.
This case is similar toEgwuatu in that each named Plaintiff was exposed to different representations, and each member of the proposed class would also have been exposed to different representations. For example, the named Plaintiffs were exposed to different representations made by third-party contractors or dealers, Plaintiff Jewell further reviewed representations made on Goodman's website, and Plaintiffs Mr. and Mrs. Wagner researched the Amana brand online. Different plaintiffs within the proposed class will have been exposed to different, varying statements alleged by Plaintiffs to constitute misrepresentations. Accordingly, none of the named Plaintiffs can be said to be a typical representative [*33] of the class for purposes of the misrepresentation component of the FDUTPA claim.
As to Plaintiffs' FDUTPA claim that Defendants omitted a material fact from its advertising to consumers, the named Plaintiffs do have interests and injuries typical to those of the class. This is because the alleged omission is the same—the alleged deceptive practice is the same. Plaintiffs assert that Defendants failed to disclose the fact that Goodman copper evaporator coils are defectively prone to develop formicary corrosion. Whether or not this omission would be likely to deceive a consumer acting reasonably in the circumstances is a question that applies equally to all class members, and the named Plaintiffs satisfy the typicality requirement for the purposes of this particular claim. See, e.g., Powertel, 776 So. 2d at 972-74 .
d. Adequacy 
Adequacy requires that "the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class." Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4) . This requirement asks "(1) whether there are any substantial conflicts of interest between the named representatives of the class and the class members; and (2) whether the representatives will adequately prosecute the action." Rosario-Guerrero, 265 F.R.D. at 628 . It "serves to uncover any conflict of interest that named parties may have with the class they represent," and it also "consider[s] the competency and any conflicts that the class counsel may have." Id . (citations omitted). In this instance, the named Plaintiffs can be said to adequately represent the class because they have interests in common with, and not antagonistic to, the interests of the class. Griffin v. Carlin, 755 F.2d 1516 , 1533 (11th Cir. 1985). In addition, Plaintiffs' attorneys are qualified and experienced in complex class action litigation. The Court finds that Plaintiffs have satisfied this requirement.
3. Rule 23(b)(3) Requirements 
Classification under Rule 23(b)(3) is appropriate when damages in the form of monetary relief is sought, "in which a class action would save time, effort, and money and would promote uniformity without sacrificing procedural fairness." Holmes v. Cont'l Can Co., 706 F.2d 1144 , 1156 (11th Cir. 1983). In addition to the requirements of Rule 23(a) , there are two additional requirements for certification under (b)(3) : "[1] Common questions [of law or fact] must predominate over any questions that affect individual parties, and [2] the class device must be superior to all other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the dispute." Id . 
Plaintiffs must first establish that common questions of law or fact predominate over any individual, plaintiff-specific issues. "'It is not necessary that all questions of fact or law be common, but only that some questions are common and that they predominate over individual questions.'" James D. Hinson, 275 F.R.D. at 644 (quoting Klay v. Humana, Inc., 382 F.3d 1241 , 1254 (11th Cir. 2004)). "Common issues of fact and law predominate if they 'ha[ve] a direct impact on every class member's effort to establish liability and on every class member's entitlement to . . . monetary relief.'" Id . (quoting Williams v. Mohawk Indus., 568 F.3d 1350 , 1357 (11th Cir. 2009)). "'Where, after adjudication of the classwide issues, plaintiffs [*34] must still introduce a great deal of individualized proof or argue a number of individualized legal points to establish most or all of the elements of their individual claims, such claims are not suitable for class certification under Rule 23(b)(3) .'" Id (quoting Klay, 382 F.3d at 1255 ). The Eleventh Circuit has explained that "predominance requires a qualitative assessment, . . . and the relative importance of the common versus individual questions also matters." Electrolux, 817 F.3d 1225 , [817 F.3D 1225], 2016 WL 1085517 , at *5 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
In this case, Plaintiffs assert that common questions of fact or law predominate. They argue that Defendants' unlawful conduct is common to the class—whether the coils were defective and whether Goodman had knowledge of the defect—and predominates over any individual issue related to causation or damages. Oppositely, Goodman argues that individual issues related to causation and damages predominate over any common questions.
Upon a thorough review of the record, and considering the relative importance of the common versus individual questions, the Court finds that individual questions related to causation and damages predominate over any common questions related to Defendants' conduct for both the breach of express warranty and the FDUTPA claims. As to the breach of express warranty claim, Florida law requires manifestation of the defect, causation, and pre-suit notice. First, the Court finds that individual questions concerning liability, causation, and damages predominate over any common questions. "Despite Plaintiffs' repeated characterizations that this case involves a uniform defect that can be proven through common proof of causation, the record suggests otherwise." City of St. Petersburg v. Total Containment, Inc., 265 F.R.D. 630 , 646 (S.D. Fla. 2010). In Total Containment, the district court explained that predominance is lacking where the plaintiffs' ability to demonstrate causation by generalized proof is lacking. See  id. at 640-41 . Indeed, "generalized proof" of causation must be available "before common questions can be found to predominate. . . . [Generalized proof] is not well suited for those cases in which no one set of operative facts establishes liability and no single proximate cause equally applies to each potential class member."  Id. at 641 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
In Total Containment, the product at issue was manufactured and distributed by various entities over a 15-year period, and numerous models were produced.  Id. at 641 . In this case, Goodman manufactured the copper evaporator coils for all relevant years, and only one model was produced. The facts of this case are clearly less complex than those of Total Containment, yet this does not mean that generalized proof of causation is available in this case; there are significant hurdles that remain. Plaintiffs seek to prove a uniform defect with generalized proof, but there is simply a lack of evidence to support such a showing. See  id. at 640-41 . Some examples of individual questions related to causation might ask whether [*35] the coil failed due to environmental factors, normal wear and tear, improper installation, other types of corrosion, or misuse. See  id. at 641 ("In addition, each class member will likely have encountered different installation, maintenance, and environmental conditions.").
Even if Plaintiffs could produce evidence that Goodman's copper evaporator coils contain a common defect—the propensity to develop formicary corrosion and leak refrigerant—the question of whether and why a particular coil failed are individual questions that will be unique to each class member and would overwhelm the litigation. It is undisputed that copper evaporator coils can fail for a number of reasons, and air conditioning systems can leak refrigerant for a number of reasons. Without individual inquiry, there is no way to determine if a plaintiff's Goodman product experienced a leakage of refrigerant due to a failure in the evaporator coil, and if so, whether the leak was due to formicary corrosion. These individual questions of causation predominate. See, e.g., Total Containment, 265 F.R.D. at 640-41 ; Kia Motors, 985 So. 2d at 1140 .
Likewise, individual questions of fact predominate over common questions for purposes of Plaintiffs' FDUTPA claim. Plaintiffs must demonstrate that Defendants' misrepresentations and omissions would be likely to deceive a consumer acting reasonably in the circumstances, to the consumer's detriment. As to Plaintiffs' misrepresentations claim, the named Plaintiffs and other putative class members were not exposed to the same representations and statements. It would require individual inquiry to determine the various statements any particular plaintiff was exposed to, and then, whether each statement would be likely to deceive a consumer acting reasonably in the circumstances. This inquiry is "relevant to the element of deception," because the test asks whether the conduct "was likely to mislead a consumer acting reasonably in the circumstances." James D. Hinson, 275 F.R.D. at 645 . Individual circumstances in which each putative class member was subject to different representations could affect whether a reasonable consumer would have been misled by Defendants' conduct in the same circumstances. See id . 
Individual questions of fact likewise predominate over common questions as to Plaintiffs' FDUTPA omission claim. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants omitted material information related to the defective nature of Goodman's copper evaporator coils. In order to prove Defendants' liability for this claim, then, Plaintiffs must first demonstrate that the copper evaporator coils were indeed uniformly defective. "Plaintiffs have repeatedly characterized this case as involving a uniform defect that causes general harm." Total Containment, 265 F.R.D. at 637 . However, "generalized proof" necessary to establish the existence of a uniform defect is not available in this case, as explained above in the Court's discussion of Plaintiffs' breach of warranty claim. And if there is no generalized proof available to demonstrate the existence of a uniform defect, [*36] there can be no general evidence of a deceptive practice. This issue predominates over the common question of reliance (i.e., causation) by Plaintiffs and other putative class members.
As a final matter, "the individualized nature of determining putative class members' damages also contribute to a lack of predominance in this case."  Id. at 641 . The presence of individualized damages does not necessarily preclude a finding that common issues predominate, but "it certainly does not help."  Id. at 642 .
In sum, individual questions of fact predominate over any common questions for both causes of action for purposes of Plaintiffs' damages class.
4. Rule 23(b)(2) Requirements 
Class certification under Rule 23(b)(2) is appropriate where "the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole." Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) . "The very nature of a (b)(2) class is that it is homogeneous without any conflicting interests between the members of the class." Holmes, 706 F.2d at 1155 . "Monetary relief may be obtained in a Rule 23(b)(2) class action so long as the predominant relief sought is injunctive or declaratory." Murray v. Auslander, 244 F.3d 807 , 812 (11th Cir. 2001) (citing Allison v. Citgo Petroleum Corp., 151 F.3d 402 , 411 (5th Cir. 1998); Holmes, 706 F.2d at 1155 ). "'[M]onetary relief predominates in (b)(2) class actions unless it is incidental to requested injunctive or declaratory relief.'" Id . (quoting Allison, 151 F.3d at 415 (emphasis added)). "'Ideally, incidental damages should be only those to which class members automatically would be entitled once liability to the class (or subclass) as a whole is established. . . . Liability for incidental damages should not . . . entail complex individualized determinations.'" Id . (quoting Allison, 151 F.3d at 415 ). The question is whether plaintiffs seek damages as a "group remedy" or whether they seek damages based on individualized harm, which would "compel[] an inquiry into each class member's individual circumstances." Id . If damages depend more on the varying circumstances and merits of each class member's case, then the class's damages claims predominate over the class's claims for injunctive or declaratory relief. See id . 
In this case, Plaintiffs "request that the Court declare Goodman's air conditioners are defective and provide the necessary injunctive relief such that Class Members who experience future [coil] failures will be reimbursed by Goodman for the cost to replace and repair the defective coils." (Doc. 76 at 28). Defendants argue, among other things, that Plaintiffs are improperly seeking future individualized monetary payouts under the guise of injunctive relief. (Doc. 89 at 33-34).
The Court agrees with Defendants. The proposed injunctive relief class seems to be disguising a true request for future, individualized monetary payouts in the event that consumers who have purchased Goodman products experience coil failure and incur labor costs related to the issue. See Wal-Mart, 564 U.S. at 359-60 . While any injunctive relief would declare Goodman's copper evaporator coils "defective," only those class [*37] members whose coils manifested a defect and incurred damages in the future would be entitled to any concrete recovery. Thus, the monetary relief sought is not simply incidental to the injunctive or declaratory relief; it is the main relief. This is not permitted by Rule 23(b)(2) . See id . 
Furthermore, as noted above, FDUTPA claims are limited to actual damages, and "do not include consequential damages, such as repair damages." Kia Motors, 985 So. 2d at 1140 . The monetary damages sought by Plaintiffs for purposes of their FDUTPA claim are improper and unavailable.
5. Whether Plaintiffs' Damages Models are Correct 
Plaintiffs rely on an expert, Frank Bernatowicz, for their damages models. Defendants argue that his models do not satisfy Comcast Corp. v. Behrend, 133 S. Ct. 1426 , 185 L. Ed. 2d 515 (2013), because they are overinclusive and fail to measure only the harm attributable to the only purported defect, formicary corrosion. (Doc. 115 at 2). Comcast requires that, for a class to be certified, the damages model must measure, on a classwide basis, "only those damages attributable to [Plaintiffs'] theory [of liability]."  Id. at 1433 . "Calculations need not be exact, but the class-certification stage (as at trial), any model supporting a plaintiff's damages case must be consistent with its liability case." Id . (citations omitted).
Bernatowicz offers two damages models: one for out-of-pocket expenses, and one for future repair costs or diminution in value. However, neither model limits damages to those losses sustained due to formicary corrosion, which is Plaintiffs' exclusive theory of liability. There is an additional issue related to FDUTPA damages. That statute limits damages to "actual damages," which is defined as "[the] premium received [due to] the alleged misrepresentation." Randolph v. J.M. Smucker Co., 303 F.R.D. 679 , 698 (S.D. Fla. 2014). Neither damages model purports to measure any price premium received by the alleged misrepresentations or omissions.
Plaintiffs argue that their damages models are based on Goodman's own standardized repair cost schedules and thus sufficiently calculate damages as to class members who had to pay out-of-pocket repair costs. Plaintiffs allege that they were sold defective products, and the most reasonable model of damages is to compensate Plaintiffs and the class for the cost to repair the defective products.
An in depth analysis of Plaintiffs' proposed damages models is unnecessary, as Plaintiffs' proposed classes fail for other reasons. It is nevertheless worth noting that Plaintiffs' damages model must reflect damages incurred due to formicary corrosion-related issues only, because this is their theory of liability. Plaintiffs' damages models fail at the present time as to the FDUTPA claim because they do not take into account any price premium received by the alleged misrepresentations and omissions.
C. Defendants' Motion to Strike Plaintiffs' Trial Expert Disclosures (Doc. 122) 
Goodman's Motion to Strike Plaintiff's Trial Expert Disclosures will be denied as moot, as class certification has been denied.
IV. CONCLUSION 
For the reasons set forth above, it is hereby [*38] ORDERED:
1. Plaintiffs' "Motion for Class Certification" (Doc. 76, filed Mar. 2, 2015) is DENIED;
2. Defendants' "Motion to Exclude the Opinions of Paul J. Sikorsky" (Doc. 88, filed Apr. 30, 2015) is GRANTED;
3. Defendants' "Motion to Strike Plaintiffs' Trial Expert Disclosures" (Doc. 122, filed Oct. 26, 2015) is DENIED AS MOOT; and
4. 4. Defendants' "Motion to Strike the Supplemental Declaration of Paul J. Sikorsky in Further Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification" (Doc. 127, filed Dec. 3, 2015) is DENIED AS MOOT.

DONE AND ORDERED at Jacksonville, Florida, this 11th day of May, 2016.

Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification and Reply to Defendants' Response in opposition both substantively advance and argue formicary corrosion as the specific defect to support their theory of liability. For the first time, in footnote one of Plaintiffs' Sur-Sur-Reply (Doc. 116), Plaintiffs state that their theory of liability is "not so narrow," but they provide no explanation as to what this broader theory of liability may be. In any event, at the hearing on the motion, Plaintiffs clarified and reaffirmed that their theory of liability is exclusively based on the alleged defect of formicary corrosion.

Notably, in Plaintiffs' response to Defendants' motion to exclude the opinions of Sikorsky, Plaintiffs assert that the Court should not undertake a full Daubert analysis because merits discovery was still underway at the time Sikorsky submitted his declaration, and thus Sikorsky's opinions were incomplete based on incomplete discovery. (Doc. 101 at 8-9). Further, Plaintiffs' damages expert, Frank Bernatowicz ("Bernatowicz"), testified that his opinions were prepared for the purpose of class certification. (Doc. 122 at 4).
In this case, the parties did not bifurcate discovery; they undertook class certification discovery and merits discovery together. Defendants point out that Plaintiffs have sought no further discovery and have disclosed no additional testing, nor have they supplemented their disclosures based on any new discovery, since filing their Motion for Class Certification. (Doc. 122 at 3-4).

fn

Sikorsky submitted a supplemental declaration on November 24, 2015, updating the warranty claims rate figures for returned copper evaporator coils in Florida for the years 2006 through 2014. (Doc. 125). This data had been provided to Plaintiffs during discovery, but Plaintiffs only discovered the more comprehensive data at a later date. After discovering the data, which discloses a higher warranty claims rate for each year than previously reported, Sikorsky promptly produced an updated supplement. Defendants filed a "Motion to Strike" Sikorsky's supplemental declaration on December 3, 2015, arguing that the supplement is untimely and prejudicial. (Doc. 127). In response, Plaintiffs argue that there is no prejudice to Defendants because the supplemental declaration simply updates and reinforces Sikorsky's original opinions; the new data does not contradict Sikorsky's prior statements. (Doc. 131).
The Court agrees with Plaintiffs that the effect of the supplemental declaration is overstated by Defendants. While it is true that the supplement is untimely, there is negligible prejudice to Defendants to allow the updated data into evidence, especially at this stage of the litigation. Sikorsky concluded that a warranty claims rate that exceeds one percent for any given year is evidence of a defect; the new percentages for each year do not change Sikorsky's opinions at all, but simply act to reinforce them.
Regardless, this issue is moot because the Court has found Sikorsky's opinion on warranty claims rates to be unreliable; the precise figures for each year are not material.

Jonathan Googdman 
ORDER ON DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO DISMISS FOR LACK OF SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION OR FOR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH COURT ORDERS
During many years between 1950 and 1988, CBS, NBC and others involved in the syndication industry broadcast the television game show "Truth or Consequences." The long-running show involved contestants selected from the studio audience who could either "tell the truth" (i.e., correctly answer a question) or be forced to pay the consequences (i.e., perform a stunt, usually wacky or zany). Several personalities hosted the show over the years, but Bob Barker (who also hosted "The Price is Right" from 1972 - 2007) had the longest reign, from 1957 to 1975. Mr. Barker's signoff ended with the phrase, "Hoping all your consequences are happy ones."1 
In the instant copyright infringement case, Plaintiff, Latele Television, C.A. ("Plaintiff" or "Latele") did not tell the truth in discovery and it now must confront the consequences. Unlike the consequences envisioned in Mr. Barker's final comments to the game show television audience, however, the consequences here will not be happy for Plaintiff. On the other hand, the consequences will fall short of the full-fledged happiness urged by Defendants.2 
Defendants want this Court to dismiss this copyright infringement action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because of a purported lack of standing. Alternatively, they ask for the most extreme sanction available -- dismissal -- for failure to comply with Court orders concerning discovery (i.e., for not being [*1311] truthful about documents and information which should have been produced in response to discovery requests and Court orders).
Focusing on the first argument for dismissal, the Court cannot now dismiss the case for lack of standing because [**2] Defendants' argument depends on contested facts. The Undersigned is not going to simply choose sides and pick Defendants' view of the facts and disregard Plaintiff's view in order to conclude that Plaintiff lacks standing and to then enter a related dismissal order.
Defendants contend that Plaintiff lacks standing to pursue this claim because it did not own the copyright at issue on the date it filed this lawsuit. [ECF No. 166, p. 1]. Specifically, they argue that Plaintiff assigned its rights -- first to its principal, Fernando Fraiz, and then to another entity he owns, Latele Productions, Inc. ("Latele U.S."). [ Id. at pp. 3-5]. But there is a significant factual dispute as to the effectiveness of those assignments and, assuming that Plaintiff in fact assigned away the copyright at issue, whether those assignments were, for all practical purposes, rescinded (or undone or reversed or corrected -- all terms used by the parties, witnesses and counsel in evidentiary hearings and post-hearing memoranda). The Court does not believe it prudent to wade into this murky factual morass and unilaterally make credibility assessments. Cf. Dominion Assets LLC v. Masimo Corp., No. 12-cv-02773-BLF, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 88285 , [2014 BL 179838], 2014 WL 2937058 (dismissing patent infringement lawsuit without prejudice because Plaintiff assigned its patent rights, did not prove mutual rescission of the assignment agreement and did not sufficiently explain why the assignee demanded material terms above and beyond mere rescission).3 
Because the Court cannot simply dismiss the case on the subject matter argument, the only remaining issue (and it is a significant one, to be sure) is the argument for dismissal triggered by substantial discovery violations. [ECF No. 166, p. 1].
Based on the record evidence presented, the Undersigned is not going to dismiss the case (or enter a default against Plaintiff) for discovery violations either. However, because Plaintiff failed to produce relevant documents responsive to discovery requests, provided an incorrect or significantly misleading interrogatory answer, submitted a false or substantially incorrect declaration, provided incorrect or misleading deposition testimony and never timely advised its own trial counsel about significant transactions which might affect its standing to prosecute this case, the Court will be generating consequences -- relief, albeit short of dismissal or default, to Defendants.
Specifically, the consequences are designed to address the prejudice generated by Plaintiff's discovery shortcomings. Therefore, this case is being taken off of the trial calendar in order to give Defendants the opportunity to take additional discovery concerning certain documents which Plaintiff failed to timely produce. Because Plaintiff generated the need to obtain more discovery, it is only the Defendants who are being permitted to pursue additional discovery after expiration of the discovery deadline. Plaintiff will be required to pay the attendance fees for court reporters and videographers used at any new depositions [**3] scheduled by Defendants and it will need to pay the travel costs for one defense attorney if any of the depositions are taken out of town. Plaintiff will need to pay these expenses within 30 days of receiving an invoice from Defendants. In addition, the Court is awarding Defendants attorney's fees in connection with the instant motion to dismiss. [ECF No. 166].
Finally, if the additional discovery (or other evidence obtained by Defendants) establishes that Plaintiff fraudulently manufactured and post-dated a critical document (the so-called "Addendum") in order to avoid the dismissal Defendants seek in their motion for lack of standing, then the Court will entertain another dismissal motion for fraud on the court/intentional bad faith discovery abuse. Likewise, if the Undersigned concludes that Plaintiff destroyed relevant evidence after a duty to preserve evidence was created, then the Court will also consider another defense-filed dismissal motion.4 
[*1312] I. Factual Background Concerning Discovery 
In its Complaint, Latele alleges different types of copyright infringement by Defendants of the popularMaria Maria telenovela, a Spanish-language soap opera. In particular, the works at issue are 198 episodes of television programming allegedly owned by Latele, originally airing in 1989, and 178 episodes of television programming allegedly aired by Defendants. El Rostro de Analia ("El Rostro") is the allegedly infringing work. Latele alleges that Defendants hired the author of Maria Maria to develop El Rostro, a telenovela which Latele alleges is so similar to Maria Maria that the public and press have designated it as a remake or retelling. Latele's three-count Complaint pursues claims for copyright infringement, contributory copyright infringement and vicarious copyright infringement. [ECF No. 1, pp. 15-22].
James Sammataro, of Stroock & Stroock & Lavan ("SSL"), Plaintiff's initial counsel of record, signed and filed the lawsuit. [ECF No. 1, p. 24]. At an August 20-21, 2014 evidentiary hearing (the "Evidentiary Hearing") designed to determine whether certain privileged documents in RAL's possession should be produced to Defendants in response to a discovery subpoena, he testified that Robert Allen Law ("RAL") was the "conduit" for nearly all documents and information he received from Plaintiff.5 [ECF No. 324, p. 24]. This included documents and information related to Plaintiff's discovery responses. [ Id.]. RAL was Plaintiff's outside general counsel and provided significant assistance to SSL in this litigation. [ Id. at 25]. In particular, Peggy Garcia, an RAL attorney, coordinated the production of documents and information given to Mr. Sammataro. [ Id. at pp. 24-25, 116].
Neither Plaintiff, nor RAL, ever disclosed critical copyright transfers, negotiations leading up to the execution of transfer documents, or related documents to SSL despite repeated, direct inquiries during SSL's investigation of the Complaint and preparation of responses to discovery. As described below, Mr. Sammataro did not see several key documents until they were [**4] included as exhibits to Defendants' instant motion to dismiss, filed on March 31, 2014. [ECF No. 324, pp. 39-42]. He also had no knowledge of those transactions before Defendants filed their dismissal motion (long after he was no longer involved in this case). [ Id.].
Ms. Garcia graduated from law school in December 2008. [ECF No. 325, pp. 58-59]. She began working at RAL in January of 2010. [ Id.]. She has never done any litigation work. [ Id.]. RAL has three full-time litigation attorneys and one attorney who does both litigation and real estate law, but she never consulted with any of them about the discovery-related assistance she provided to Plaintiff Latele and the SSL firm in this case. [ Id. at pp. 58-61]. Before this lawsuit, Ms. Garcia never helped clients in reviewing proposed interrogatory answers, reviewing proposed responses to document requests or reviewing other responses to discovery. [ Id.].
Notwithstanding this lack of litigation experience, Ms. Garcia testified at the Evidentiary Hearing that she reviewed discovery responses with Fernando Fraiz, Plaintiff's principal, and was aware of documents executed in April 2012 transferring Maria Maria first to Mr. Fraiz (the "First Assignment"), and then to Latele U.S. (the "Second Assignment").6 [ Id. at pp. 58-62]. Ms. Garcia drafted and notarized some of the documents; yet she did not reveal this information to SSL or ensure it was included in interrogatory answers, some of which she also notarized. [ Id.]. She admitted, in retrospect, that the information and documents should have been disclosed. [ Id. at pp. 61-64].
The First Assignment and Second Assignment are at the heart of Defendants' motion to dismiss. Basically, Defendants say Latele lacks standing to bring these copyright claims because it no longer owned the copyright to [*1313] Maria Maria as of the time the lawsuit was filed. After Defendants filed their motion to dismiss, Latele produced an "Addendum," supposedly prepared two years earlier, which, if true, Latele contends would completely undermine the standing-based dismissal motion. Defendants accuse Latele of fraudulently creating the Addendum and falsely claiming it was prepared in 2012, rather than in 2014 (in response to the motion to dismiss).
Ms. Garcia's only knowledge of the so-called "Addendum," which Plaintiff now claims reversed the First Assignment (which Mr. Fraiz described as an "involuntary error") came from oral conversations with Mr. Fraiz. She advised Mr. Fraiz that "a transfer of Maria Maria would negatively affect this case." [ECF No. 324, pp. 118-19].
Ms. Garcia testified that she did not disclose the existence of these transactions (whether they were undone, rescinded, aborted, canceled, superseded, corrected or otherwise deemed no longer valid) to SSL or to Defendants because her understanding was that the underlying transaction never went through. [ECF No. 325, p. 60]. She did not do any independent legal research on her own to see if the information about the transactions should have been disclosed in interrogatory answers or whether documents concerning the transactions should have been produced [**5] in response to document requests. [ Id. at p. 61]. She did not consult with any of the RAL litigation attorneys to see if they would have disclosed the information. [ Id. at pp. 60-61]. And she did not see the Addendum which supposedly (if not manufactured after the fact) reversed the First Assignment. [ECF No. 324, pp. 90, 106-07].
Although Ms. Garcia notarized one of the transaction documents, she did not keep a copy. [ Id. at p. 88-89]. She returned the original to Mr. Fraiz but did not ask him for a copy when she was marshaling documents for the SSL firm. [ Id.].
Fernando Fraiz admitted executing the First and Second Assignments but testified that the transfers, negotiations and related documents were never disclosed by Plaintiff in discovery because the deal was never consummated; and regardless, he claimed, Maria Maria was never an intended part of the deal. [ECF No. 324, pp. 256, 262-64, 267]. He testified that including Maria Maria in the transfers was a "mistake" he sought to correct with the Addendum. [ Id. at p. 268].
A. The Specific Discovery Conduct at Issue 
At the Evidentiary Hearing, Ms. Garcia admitted she was aware of the Transfer Documents and the Addendum; in fact, she drafted the Second Assignment and Joint Consent. [ECF No. 324, pp. 85, 87]. As Plaintiff's outside general counsel, RAL coordinated Plaintiff's responses to discovery requests in this case with outside litigation counsel (i.e., SSL). [ Id. at pp. 25, 116]. Ms. Garcia reviewed with Mr. Fraiz the draft answers to some of Defendants' interrogatories. For example, Ms. Garcia reviewed Plaintiff's Answers and Objections to Defendant Telemundo Studios Miami, LLC's First Set of Interrogatories with Mr. Fraiz and notarized his signature on that document. [ECF No. 324, pp. 88, 91-96]. The first interrogatory sought detailed information about Maria Maria's chain of title.7 
In its interrogatory answer, Plaintiff failed to identify --or make any reference to -- the Transfer Documents and failed to identify Mr. Fraiz or Latele U.S. as "entities or individuals who have ever owned [Maria Maria]," though at the Evidentiary Hearing on the privilege waiver issue, Ms. Garcia admitted that "[i]n hindsight I should have." [ECF No. 325, p. 61]. Plaintiff failed to produce these documents in response to Defendants' document requests. Request 19 of Defendants' Second Request for Production (served November 16, 2012) sought: "All documents reflecting or evidencing any transfers, licenses, sublicenses, encumbrances, pledges, or any other transactions of any kind involving any of the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of any kind, or any other rights related to the work(s) allegedly infringed."8 
In response to the document request, Plaintiff "agree[d] to produce all responsive non-privileged documents specifically pertaining to Maria Maria . . . . " [Ex. 42, pp. 16-17]. Nevertheless, Plaintiff never produced or otherwise [*1314] disclosed the Transfer Documents or Addendum in response to this or any other discovery requests.
Defendants' Fourth Request for Production sought, at Request 11:
Communications between Plaintiff (specifically including any of its officers [**6] and affiliated entities) and LaTele Productions, Inc. [i.e. Latele U.S.] (or any predecessor, successor, or related entities), regarding any transaction, offer, arrangement, or proposal relating to telenovelas, including, without limitation, the . . . assignment . . . of any telenovela, including, without limitation, Maria Maria . . . .
[Ex. 43, p. 6]. In response, Plaintiff stated: "There are NO responsive documents in LATELE'S possession, custody or control." [Ex. 44, p. 2] (emphasis in original). Defendants' other document requests and interrogatories sought information about negotiations and other documents.9 In each of these document requests, Defendants sought "all electronically stored information" ("ESI") in addition to other formats, and thus the requests included metadata.10 

Defendants previously have urged that Plaintiff's discovery violations -- i.e., Latele's failure to produce the Transfer Documents and Latele's purported fabrication of the Addendum -- were sufficient to meet the crime-fraud exception and warrant waiver of the attorney client privilege in connection with certain RAL documents. The Evidentiary Hearing was on these very issues and a significant part of that hearing involved the circumstances under which the Transfer Documents and the Addendum were created (and the facts surrounding the purported public filing of the Addendum with a Venezuelan notary).
Mr. Fraiz testified at the Evidentiary Hearing that the First Assignment was "corrected" and the Second Assignment and Joint Consent were, for all practical purposes, ineffective. [ECF No. 324, p. 242]. Defendants contend that Mr. Fraiz's testimony on this point is not credible. They also make another argument: even if the transactions were undone or reversed or otherwise ineffective, they were unquestionably responsive to multiple discovery requests propounded by Defendants. Each attorney who testified (including Ms. Garcia herself) indicated that these documents were responsive to requests for documents reflecting any transactions involving Maria Maria.11 But Plaintiff repeatedly swore that no such documents or transactions existed in its possession, custody or control.
For instance, on February 26, 2014, the then-assigned magistrate judge issued an Omnibus Order, which denied, in part, Defendants' Consolidated Motion to Compel, based on Plaintiff's statements that "it has no responsive documents" and "it has 'nothing else to produce,'" but clarified "that Plaintiff is obligated to produce all active and past negotiations regarding Maria Maria" and required that "Plaintiff shall clarify in a proper response that it has produced 'all responsive documents.'" [ECF No. 134, pp. 2-3].
The Omnibus Order (on discovery issues) also required Plaintiff to "provide the exact searches [for ESI] that were performed by its IT personnel." [ Id. at p. 2]. On February 27, 2014, Defendants' counsel wrote to Plaintiff indicating "Defendants' position that a complete response to this portion of the Omnibus Order would require [Plaintiff] to state not only what search terms were used, but also what locations [**7] were searched, for what types of ESI, on what dates." [ECF No. 166-4].
On March 7, 2014, LaTele filed its Verified Notice of Full Compliance with Omnibus Order. [ECF No. 144]. In response to Defendants' request for "Negotiations for the Sale, Licensing, Transfer or Other Transactions related to the Catalogue of Programming Received from Marte TV," Plaintiff stated: "There are NO additional responsive documents in Plaintiff's possession custody or control to produce. To the extent any responsive documents may exist, they would be in the custody, possession and control of a third party, Plaintiff's exclusive distributor, SOMOS, who is under subpoena to produce same ([*1315] and in fact has already done so)." [ Id. at p. 2] (emphasis in original).
In a written response to Defendants' request for "Documents Reflecting Ownership, Transactions, or Disputes of the Asserted Work," Plaintiff stated: "Plaintiff hereby clarifies, for the record, that all responsive documents to this issue have already been produced." [ Id. at p. 3]. Plaintiff also attached a sworn Affidavit executed by Fernando Fraiz on March 7, 2014, wherein he attested: "all responsive documents regarding the asserted work, meaning documents reflecting ownership, transactions, or disputes about same, have already been produced by Plaintiff as to responsive documents in its custody, possession, and control." [ECF No. 141-1, p. 2].
The Court previously found that these statements -- made while Plaintiff silently withheld responsive documents and provided incorrect interrogatory answers -- were false.12 [ECF No. 362, p. 15]. Moreover, the Court also noted that Plaintiff could have had a strategic motivation to hide the existence of the transactions and the documents which evidenced them.13 [ Id.].
B. The Alleged Fabrication of the Addendum 
The parties vigorously disagree about the bona fides of the so-called Addendum. Plaintiff contends it is legitimate while Defendants brand it as a fraudulent sham.
While it is uncontroverted that the Addendum first appeared in this case on April 17, 2014, as part of Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, which asserted that the Transfer Documents deprived Plaintiff of standing, Plaintiff claims the Addendum was created and executed in April 2012. [ECF Nos. 185, p. 6; 185-4]. In support of their contention that the Addendum was fabricated in response to the Motion to Dismiss, Defendants produced documentary evidence and expert testimony that the face of the Addendum indicates it was filed, and should appear, at a unique page of the records of a particular notary office. [ECF No. 325, pp. 75-85]. Nevertheless, when Defendants' expert inspected those records, a completely different document appeared. Neither party has located any notary records where the Addendum was actually recorded. Thus, Defendants assert the Addendum was not actually filed with that notary office and instead was created after-the-fact.
However, as referenced above, the Addendum itself and Mr. Fraiz's testimony support Plaintiff's position that it was created in 2012.
In addition, Plaintiff submitted [**8] the declaration (made under penalty of perjury) of Paola Alexandra Munive Castillo, a Venezuelan attorney. [ECF No. 331-2]. In this affidavit, Ms. Munive explained that she prepared, drafted and reviewed the Addendum in 2012, at the request of Xiomara Ruiz, an agent of Mr. Fraiz's. [ Id.]. Ms. Ruiz also submitted a declaration. [ECF No. 331-1].
Although Ms. Munive's declaration explains that she was involved with the Addendum in 2012, Defendants emphasize that there are several suspicious aspects to her declaration. For example, no metadata or drafts were produced. Ms. Munive, however, proffered an explanation: she said she no longer has the electronic file of the Addendum she drafted in 2012 because she prepared it on a computer [*1316] she no longer possesses. [ECF No. 331-2, p. 2]. Ms. Munive's declaration did not say anything about the server, but Ms. Ruiz's declaration said she asked Ms. Munive to conduct a search for ESI and metadata on her computer and server but that the search yielded no results. [ECF No. 331-1, p. 1].
Defendants view the absence of metadata/ESI and drafts as evidence further establishing that the Addendum "was in fact fabricated [in 2014] as part of Plaintiff's effort to manufacture standing and explain away its failure to disclose the Transfer Documents and the transactions reflected therein." [ECF 359-1, p. 12].
Defendants also argue that Plaintiff's failure to maintain such documents and ESI, created less than 4 months before filing its Complaint in this case [ECF No. 1] and after signing multiple tolling agreements [ECF No. 161-1, pp. 12-32], constitutes spoliation of evidence and warrants an adverse inference.
Defendants also contend that the Addendum, even if created in 2012, should have been disclosed in response to multiple discovery requests.
C. The November 3, 2014 Discovery Order and Plaintiff's Response 
On November 3, 2014, the Undersigned issued an Order on Whether Defendants are Entitled to Privileged Documents from Robert Allen Law, P.A. [ECF No. 362]. This Order specifically found that Plaintiff's statements in response to certain discovery requests and interrogatories, as outlined above at section I.A., were false. [ECF No. 362, p. 15]. In connection with that finding, the Undersigned explicitly noted that while Plaintiff's discovery misconduct did not create a waiver of privilege for the RAL privileged documents under the crime-fraud exception, other consequences would follow "in a later ruling on the separately filed motion to dismiss." [ Id. at pp. 16-17].
On November 7, 2014, Plaintiff, perhaps attempting to anticipate and forestall those "consequences," filed two notices. In the first, titled "Plaintiff's Corrected Notice of Compliance with Court Order [DE-134]," Plaintiff amends its original verified notice of compliance, filed in response to the Court's February 26, 2014 Order, that explicitly stated it had "NO additional responsive documents." Plaintiff purports to correct that prior statement with the substitution of a new statement that notes it likely did have the Transfer Documents in its possession as of March 7, 2014 as it received a courtesy [**9] copy of the production made by non-party Somos, and the Transfer Documents were in that production. Plaintiff states it did not then produce the Transfer Documents to Defendants because Defendants already had those documents at that time, by way of Somos. Finally, the substituted response notes that Plaintiff's counsel did not have a copy of the Addendum at the time the verified notice of compliance was filed. [ECF No. 366, p. 2].
Plaintiff also filed a "Notice of Serving Supplemental and Corrected Discovery Response" on November 7, 2014. [ECF No. 367]. This Notice documents Plaintiff's "formal, written supplementation to and correction of its prior discovery responses as to requests for information re: negotiations for 'Maria Maria,' active or in the past." [ Id. at p. 3]. Plaintiff also notes that it is serving a supplemental answer to an interrogatory regarding control of Latele. [ Id. at p. 4].
Plaintiff's two most recently filed submissions cannot remedy its past conduct. Neither the Addendum nor the Transfer Documents were produced by Plaintiff before February 27, 2014. Mr. Fraiz's affidavit submitted with Latele's verified notice of compliance stated that "all responsive documents . . . reflecting ownership, transactions, or disputes have already been produced by Plaintiff." [ECF No. 144-1, p. 2]. Peggy Garcia now admits the Transfer Documents and Addendum were responsive and should have been produced. [ECF No. 325, pp. 61-64]. Neither Plaintiff nor Ms. Garcia ever advised Mr. Sammataro, its counsel of record in this action at the time, about the Transfer Documents or the Addendum [ Id. at p. 60], and Plaintiff's own current counsel of record condemned Mr. Fraiz's failure to cooperate in discovery. [ECF No. 328, pp. 11-12].14 Moreover, the Addendum was [*1317] not produced until April 2014 -- but only after Defendants filed their motion to dismiss for lack of standing. In addition, the two submissions do not impact Mr. Fraiz's false or misleading deposition testimony, and they do not significantly undermine Defendants' theory that it is no coincidence that the two documents which could remove Plaintiff's standing were not timely produced or that the document which reversed or corrected the transactions appeared only when necessary to fend off a standing-based dismissal motion.
II. Legal Analysis 
Defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, based on the view that Latele lacks standing, was filed before Defendants learned of the Addendum. The dismissal motion is based on the theory that the Transfer Documents demonstrate that Latele did not own the exclusive right to Maria Maria when it filed the lawsuit. But now that the Addendum has surfaced, the analysis must also change.
If the Addendum was created and executed in 2012 (as opposed to being fraudulently manufactured in 2014), then Defendants' argument about the significance of the Transfer Documents is significantly undermined (and may well be completely unavailable). If the Addendum was fabricated in 2014 (in an effort to trick Defendants and the Court), then the Transfer Documents [**10] would affect Plaintiff's standing to file this lawsuit in 2012 -- and would also create grounds for dismissal under a fraud on the court doctrine.
These are big "ifs," however. They cannot be resolved now because there is evidence to support both sides' positions. Belleri v. United States, 712 F.3d 543 , 547-49 (11th Cir. 2013) (disagreeing with the defendant's argument that the appellate court could determine subject matter jurisdiction by deciding whether the plaintiff is an alien and whether he obtained derivative citizenship and remanding to the trial court after rejecting the defendant's argument that remand was unnecessary).
However, there is no doubt that Latele never timely produced the Transfer Documents and the Addendum -- and that this failure has significantly prejudiced Defendants in their ability to adequately investigate these documents. Defendants have not had the opportunity to take the depositions of Ms. Munive and Ms. Ruiz. They have not had the opportunity to thoroughly question Mr. Fraiz about the Transfer Documents, and they have not had the chance to thoroughly question Ms. Garcia about her involvement in the discovery process. Similarly, they were not previously aware of the need to probe the circumstances surrounding these documents -- because they were simply not aware that the Transfer Documents existed. In addition, Defendants were not made aware of the need to investigate Latele U.S. because Plaintiff never timely disclosed its existence nor its involvement with Maria Maria.
Likewise, there is no doubt that these documents and the information about the transactions reflected in them were responsive to numerous discovery requests -- and that Plaintiff provided false discovery responses which hid the existence of the documents and the transactions. In its opposition to the instant motion, Plaintiff argues that the Addendum did not have to be produced because it is "an internal document to the failed negotiations of certain of Plaintiff's telenovelas, that excludes the subject telenovela, Maria Maria." [ECF No. 185, p. 6, n.6]. The Court unequivocally rejects this theory, as the Addendum is clearly responsive to a request for documents evidencing "all active and past negotiations regarding Maria Maria." In fact, Plaintiff's argument is illogical and unconvincing on its face. The primary reason for the Addendum was to undo or reverse or correct the purported mistake of including Maria Maria in the Transfer Documents. If Maria Maria had clearly been excluded from the negotiations with Televisa (i.e., negotiations which Plaintiff says never "went through"), then the Addendum would have been entirely unnecessary. [ECF No. 325, pp. 60-62].
Given the potential significance of these documents (e.g., they might mean that Plaintiff lacks standing to pursue the copyright claims or they might establish that Plaintiff purported a fraud on the Court by fabricating a critical document), the only fair and reasonable way to minimize prejudice to Defendants short of outright dismissal is to permit them [**11] to take additional discovery. Because some of the witnesses are out of the country and because the trial is scheduled to occur relatively soon, the need to give Defendants additional discovery means that the case must be removed from the trial calendar. The Court will [*1318] issue a new trial scheduling order after it has the November 21, 2014 discovery hearing on Defendants' request for a forensic analysis of Plaintiff's electronic media (and after the Undersigned issues a ruling on that request).
In the meantime, however, Defendants may take discovery (both written and depositions) concerning the Transfer Documents, the Addendum, the lack of ESI/metadata, the potential spoliation or destruction of evidence, assessing whether Plaintiff's conduct constitutes bad faith15 and the circumstances surrounding the purported witnessing and filing of the Addendum in Venezuela. Defendants are specifically authorized to retake depositions, including of Mr. Fraiz, as part of this remedial process to eliminate or substantially minimize prejudice to Defendants.
Defendants have until February 10, 2015 to take the additional discovery. Plaintiff shall cooperate in facilitating the discovery requests, especially if they involve Plaintiff's employees or agents in Venezuela.
The Undersigned has reviewed portions of the transcript of Mr. Fraiz's deposition, where Plaintiff's counsel made speaking objections which Defendants criticize as improper coaching efforts. [ECF No. 166-1]. Without making a finding on whether counsel's repeated objections strayed over the line into improper coaching, the Court is putting all counsel on notice that their deposition behavior must comply with all applicable rules -- and that the Undersigned will not hesitate to impose sanctions if counsel violate the rules. To avoid any ambiguity, the Undersigned considers an "if you know" comment to a deponent before he or she answers a deposition question to usually be improper coaching, designed to signal the witness to answer that he or she does not know or remember the answer.
The Undersigned is also awarding attorney's fees in Defendant's favor in connection with the discovery violations at issue in the motion to dismiss (and as further outlined at the Evidentiary Hearing). Even assuming, as Plaintiff's urge, that the Addendum was executed in 2012, neither it nor the Transfer Documents were timely produced to Defendants. So, even accepting Plaintiff's view of the facts, but for their failure to timely produce these critical documents, coupled with Plaintiff's other discovery misconduct outlined here, Defendants would not have incurred the cost of drafting and filing their motion to dismiss or of engaging in extensive discovery-related litigation to get at the heart of the copyright chain of title issue. The award is being entered under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(b)(2)(A)(v) ,16 Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(b)(2) (failure to comply with a court order)17 and the Court's inherent power. The fees award is a consequence of Latele's bad faith [**12] failure to be truthful in discovery. As explained by the band Incubus in its "Consequence" song from its double platinum "Make Yourself" album, ""You better not blink/ Oh blink / The consequence is a bigger word than you think."18 
In rejecting Defendants' request for dismissal, the Undersigned recognizes the strong preference for a determination on the merits of a dispute. See generally Se. Banking Corp. v. Basett, 204 F.3d 1322 (11th Cir. 2000) (reversing lower court's entry of a default judgment for discovery violations). See also Bernal, 479 F. Supp. 2d at 1301-02 (modifying magistrate judge's recommendation by not striking answer and affirmative defenses but instead ordering that the jury would be instructed that certain facts had been established -- [*1319] including defendant's spoliation of evidence and procurement of false evidence). On the other hand, this preference may well yield if the Court determines later that Latele manufactured the Addendum or otherwise tried to perpetrate a fraud on the Court.
In particular, a fees award against Latele itself is justified as the Court finds that Latele either recklessly or intentionally failed to timely produce the Transfer Documents and the Addendum. Either way, I find that Latele's failure to timely produce the Transfer Documents and the Addendum constitutes bad faith discovery misconduct. In addition, the Court finds that Mr. Fraiz's deposition testimony about these documents, the negotiations with Televisa and the execution of the documents was, at best, strategically misleading, and perhaps perjurious.19 Even if Latele's conduct was merely reckless, instead of being motivated by purposeful bad faith, I find that this reckless conduct constitutes the requisite bad faith to justify sanctions under the Court's inherent power.
The Court is specifically not entering a fees award against Mr. Sammataro and SSL because there is absolutely no evidence to even suggest that they knew about the Transfer Documents, the Addendum, the negotiations with Televisa or the circumstances surrounding the execution of the documents. In fact, all the evidence is to the contrary, establishing that they did not know of these matters.
The Court is not entering a fees award against Latele's current counsel because it is unclear when they first learned of the Transfer Documents, the Addendum or the circumstances surrounding the execution of those papers. In addition, the record is hazy on when current counsel actually realized the documents had been produced to them and when they understood the documents' significance.
Defendants shall within five days of this Order submit to Plaintiff an affidavit on the amount of fees being sought (with supporting backup) and then attempt to reach an agreement with Plaintiff concerning the amount of fees. Defendants may seek attorney's fees related to the instant motion to dismiss, as well as any other fees incurred in litigating discovery disputes related to Plaintiff's non-production of the Transfer Documents and Addendum. If an agreement is reached [**13] within 10 days of this Order, then the parties shall advise the Court in a brief, jointly-filed notice and the fees shall be paid within 7 days after the filing of the notice. If the fees are paid, then Plaintiff shall within five days of payment submit to the Court's efile inbox a Notice of Compliance, attaching a declaration confirming the payment and noting the amount. If an agreement cannot be reached by the deadline, then the parties shall so advise the Court, which will then require counsel for both Plaintiff and Defendants to submit an affidavit (with backup documentation) of the fees incurred in connection with the discovery dispute (either related to filing or opposing the motion to dismiss or advocating for or against production of the discovery materials at issue here).20 
One final point: Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37 authorizes the Court to enter a fees award against the party, the party's counsel or both. Given RAL's involvement as the clearinghouse for Latele's documents and information to SSL and given Ms. Garcia's activities in connection with the Transfer Documents, reviewing interrogatory answers and providing documents to SSL, the Court will give RAL the opportunity to brief the issue of whether any portion of the fees award should be entered against it, and, if so, what percentage. The Court will also give Defendants and Latele's current counsel the chance to weigh in on this issue. Therefore, RAL, Plaintiff and Defendants may (but are not required to) submit a memorandum on this issue of no more than 10 double-spaced pages, excluding signature [*1320] block and certificate of service, within 10 days of this Order. The memoranda may be submitted regardless of whether there is an agreement as to the amount of fees.21 
If there is an agreement among Plaintiff, Defendants, RAL and Plaintiff's current counsel on whether RAL should be financially responsible for some portion of the fees award (and, if so, how much), then notice of this agreement should be timely given to the Court. In order to facilitate RAL's ability to timely submit a memorandum, Latele's current counsel shall forthwith provide a copy of this Order to RAL.
III. Conclusion 
The Motion to Dismiss is Denied. The Court will not dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because Defendants' argument that Plaintiff lacks standing hinges on contested facts. The Court will not dismiss this case based on discovery violations either -- dismissal as a sanction for discovery misconduct is the most severe sanction and the Court declines to do so at this time. However, as outlined in this Order, the Court will provide Defendants substantial relief in connection with Plaintiff's discovery misconduct:
1) The trial in this case will be continued to allow Defendants (and not Plaintiff) to conduct additional discovery. The Court will issue a new scheduling order once it rules on those issues noticed for hearing on November 21, 2014.
2) Defendants' additional discovery is subject to the following conditions:
a. The discovery is limited to this area of inquiry: [**14] the Transfer Documents, the Addendum, the lack of metadata produced by Plaintiff in connection with the Court's Post-Hearing Order [ECF No. 314], Plaintiff's potential spoliation or destruction of evidence, assessing whether Plaintiff's conduct constitutes bad faith and the circumstances surrounding the purported witnessing and filing of the Addendum in Venezuela. Defendants are specifically authorized to retake depositions, including of Mr. Fraiz.
b. The additional discovery must be completed by February 10, 2015. Plaintiff must cooperate in facilitating this discovery so that it may be completed before this deadline.
c. Plaintiff must pay the attendance fees for court reporters or videographers used at any future depositions scheduled by Defendants.
d. Plaintiff must pay the travel costs for one defense attorney at any future out-of-town depositions that Defendants choose to take.
e. Plaintiff must pay these discovery-related expenses within 30 days of receiving an invoice from Defendants.
f. Defendants may, if they choose, file another motion to dismiss the complaint for fraud on the court/intentional bad faith discovery abuse if additional discovery or other evidence obtained by Defendants establishes that Plaintiff fraudulently manufactured and post-dated the Addendum or that Plaintiff destroyed relevant evidence (such as ESI) after a duty to preserve evidence was created.
3) The Court is awarding Defendants attorney's fees in connection with the discovery violations at issue in the instant motion to dismiss. [*1321] The fees award is governed by the following conditions:
a. Defendants shall within 5 days of this Order submit to Plaintiff an affidavit on the amount of fees being sought (with supporting backup) and then attempt to reach an agreement concerning the amount of fees. Defendants may seek attorney's fees related to the instant motion to dismiss, as well as any other fees incurred in litigating discovery disputes related to Plaintiff's non-production of the Transfer Documents and Addendum. If an agreement is reached within 10 days of this Order, then the parties shall advise the Court in a brief, jointly-filed notice and the fees shall be paid within 7 days after the filing of the notice. If the fees are paid, then Plaintiff shall within five days of payment submit to the Court's efile inbox a Notice of Compliance, attaching a declaration confirming the payment and noting the amount. If an agreement cannot be reached by the deadline, then the parties shall so advise the Court, which will then require counsel for both Plaintiff and Defendants to submit an affidavit (with backup documentation) of the fees incurred in connection with the discovery dispute (either related to filing or opposing the motion to dismiss or advocating for or against production of the discovery materials at issue here).
b. If Defendants or Plaintiff's current counsel believe that RAL should also be responsible for fees either under Rule 37, section 1927 or the Court's inherent power, then they shall so advise [**15] RAL in writing within five days of this Order.
c. Defendants, Plaintiff and RAL may, but are not required to, file a memorandum of no more than 10 double-spaced pages, excluding signature block and certificate of service, within 10 days of this Order on the subject of whether the fees award should be entered against Latele, RAL or both.22

Based on events occurring after the filing of its dismissal motion, Defendants are also seeking [ECF No. 358] an order compelling Plaintiff to hire an independent forensic computer expert to attempt to recover metadata and other documents from computers and other electronic media used by Plaintiff and its agents, including attorneys, in April 2012. That request is scheduled for a discovery hearing on November 21, 2014. The details and significance of the electronically stored information at issue in Defendants' request will be outlined later in this Order.

The Evidentiary Hearing was held, in part, to obtain evidence concerning Defendants' argument that the crime-fraud exception generated a waiver of the attorney-client privilege for the RAL documents.

The Parties and this Court have previously outlined in detail the First Assignment, the Second Assignment, the Joint Consent and the Addendum -- all documents that play a key role in the motion to dismiss at issue here. [See, e.g., ECF No. 362]. The parties agree that Mr. Fraiz, Plaintiff's principal and highest authority, entered into the first three of these transactions less than four months before this action was filed. The First Assignment was a document executed in April 2012 that transferred Maria Maria to Mr. Fraiz personally. The Second Assignment, also executed in April 2012, transferred Maria Maria from Mr. Fraiz to Mr. Fraiz's wholly owned Florida company, Latele U.S. The Joint Consent, dated April 18, 2012, authorized Mr. Fraiz to enter into the Second Assignment on behalf of Latele U.S. Plaintiff claims that the Addendum was executed in April 2012 as well, and that it rescinded (or corrected) the transfers made in the First and Second Assignment. Defendants disagree. These documents are examined in more detail below, at section I.A.

Plaintiff's Answers and Objections to Defendants' First Set of Interrogatories can be found at ECF No. 166-3, pp. 68-79.

Ms. Garcia testified that she never advised Mr. Fraiz not to disclose the transactions reflected in the First Assignment, the Second Assignment or the Joint Written Consent. [ECF No. 324, pp. 93-95]. She also testified that Mr. Fraiz never asked her to not disclose the transactions. [ Id.].

fn 
12
In a deposition, Mr. Fraiz testified that he never contemplated personally owning any rights to Maria Maria and that such a transaction was never executed. In addition, when Mr. Fraiz was asked at his deposition about an unsigned copy of the First Assignment, Plaintiff's counsel objected and implied that the question was merely "hypothetical" and Mr. Fraiz then stated that "if at any time this means to perfect it, it was never executed." [ECF No. 166-1, pp. 8-11].

fn 
13
As outlined in Defendants' motion to dismiss, a plaintiff seeking to bring a claim for copyright infringement must exclusively own the work it claims was infringed at the time the lawsuit is filed. Without such ownership, a plaintiff lacks standing to bring the claim. See e.g., Saregama India Ltd. v. Mosley, 635 F.3d 1284 , 1286 (11th Cir. 2011) (finding lack of subject matter jurisdiction because Plaintiff did not currently own a copyright in the work at issue). If the Transfer Documents were not undone by the so-called Addendum, then, Defendants argue, Plaintiff has no standing to pursue the case and the Court must dismiss it. It was only after Defendants filed their motion to dismiss that Plaintiff produced the Addendum.
The Undersigned is not now making any findings about the legal significance of the Transfer Documents or the Addendum -- other than to conclude that they were responsive to discovery requests. Likewise, the Court is not reaching any conclusions here about Plaintiff's standing (or lack of standing) to pursue this lawsuit.
Nevertheless, a federal court is always concerned about subject matter jurisdiction. Therefore, Latele will need to establish at trial its standing to pursue the lawsuit. In other words, it will need to prove that it exclusively owned the rights to Maria Maria on the day it filed the lawsuit. Owning the rights by the time of trial is insufficient if ownership when the lawsuit was filed is not established. Dominion Assets, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 88285 , 2014 WL 2937058 at *9-10 (noting that the plaintiff indisputably owned the patents at the time of the motion but dismissing because the plaintiff could not demonstrate that it held legal title at the inception of the lawsuit).

fn 
14
By prior Order, the Undersigned required that certain documents in the so-called Somos Production be produced by Plaintiff, which had asserted attorney-client privilege over those materials notwithstanding that they were (a) in the possession of Somos, and (b) Plaintiff acknowledged that Somos was outside the scope of any attorney-client privilege Plaintiff might have with its counsel. [ECF No. 328, p. 10].
In that Order, the Undersigned noted that several of the emails in question, which have now been produced to Defendants, described Plaintiff's potential failure to meet discovery obligations. For instance, one email, from Plaintiff's current counsel of record to Mr. Fraiz had the subject line "Discovery Failures." [ Id. at pp. 11-12]. In another email [ECF No. 296-3], Latele's current litigation counsel complained to Mr. Fraiz about his "level of non-compliance, resistance and delaying tactics." In another, he advises that "Latele may lose the case and/or be sanctioned for violating the discovery rules." The Court previously ordered Latele to produce these formerly privileged communications to Defendants because Latele waived privilege by intentionally sending the documents to Somos, a third party.

fn 
15
In the Eleventh Circuit, bad faith is the key to unlocking the Court's inherent power to impose sanctions for spoliation. Penalty Kick Mgmt. Ltd. v. Coca Cola Co., 318 F.3d 1284 , 1294 (11th Cir. 2003) (no adverse inference from missing label because there was no indication of bad faith). See also Mann v. Taser Int'l, Inc., 588 F.3d 1291 , 1310 (11th Cir. 2009). The Undersigned does not have enough information to determine whether bad faith exists in connection with Latele's apparent failure to preserve ESI. Deposition testimony and/or additional document production from Latele may shed light on this. However, the issue of Latele's failure to preserve ESI (such as metadata for the Addendum purportedly created in Venezuela in 2012) is analyzed differently than its failure to produce the Transfer Documents and the Addendum, in part because the factual record has not been fully developed.

fn

See, e.g., Bernal v. All Am. Inv. Realty, Inc., 479 F. Supp. 2d 1291 , 1335 (S.D. Fla. 2006).

The rule gives trial judges broad discovery to fashion appropriate sanctions for violation of discovery orders. Malautea v. Suzuki Motor Co., Ltd., 987 F.2d 1536 (11th Cir. 1993). The severe sanction of a dismissal or default judgment is appropriate only as a last resort, when less-drastic sanctions would not ensure compliance with the court's orders. Navarro v. Cohan, 856 F.2d 141 , 142 (11th Cir. 1988). See also Betty K Agencies, Ltd. v. M/V Monada, 432 F.3d 1333 , 1337-38 (11th Cir. 2005) (vacating with-prejudice dismissal and noting that such a result "is an extreme sanction that may be properly imposed only when: (1) a party engages in a clear pattern of delay or willful contempt (contumacious conduct); and (2) the district court specifically finds that lesser sanctions would not suffice.")

See generally, Allapattah Servs., Inc. v. Exxon Corp., 372 F. Supp. 2d 1344 , 1373 (S.D. Fla. 2005) (inherent power can be invoked even if procedural rules exist which sanction the same conduct).

fn 
20
If no agreement can be reached, then the Court will evaluate the attorney's fees incurred by all parties in order to assess the reasonableness of the fees requested by Defendants.
Rule 37 authorizes a variety of sanctions, including dismissal of the entire action, rendering a default judgment against the disobedient party, striking pleadings in whole or in part, prohibiting the disobedient party from supporting or opposing designated claims or defenses or from introducing designated matters in evidence. The Court is not now imposing those harsher remedies because the Undersigned views the sanctions imposed -- additional discovery (taken only by Defendants), payment of certain discovery expenses and an attorney's fees award -- to be adequate. But the Undersigned may well reconsider these more-severe sanctions if presented with evidence that exhibits have been fraudulently created or that relevant evidence (such as metadata and ESI) has been destroyed. Goforth v. Owens, 766 F.2d 1533 (11th Cir. 1985) (affirming dismissal due to the plaintiff's counsel's pattern of delay and refusal to comply with court directions and noting there was no abuse of discretion).

fn 
21
The Court might be authorized to award fees against RAL under the Court's inherent power and 28 U.S.C. § 1927 , but those sources of authority require a finding of bad faith. Amlong v. Denny's, Inc., 457 F.3d 1180 , 1190 (11th Cir. 2006) (bad faith needed for section 1927 fees against counsel); Barnes v. Dalton, 158 F.3d 1212 , 1214 (11th Cir. 1988) (inherent power). Although reckless conduct is sufficient to justify sanctions requiring bad faith, negligent conduct, standing alone, will not support a finding of bad faith. Amlong, 457 F.3d at 1193 .
RAL's activities were either maliciously intentional (e.g., purposefully hiding documents and information in discovery, in an improper attempt to help its client avoid a thorny standing issue), reckless (i.e., a "gross deviation from reasonable conduct," Amlong, 457 F.3d at 1191 ) or merely negligent (e.g., a comparatively inexperienced attorney with no litigation experience who exercised poor judgment in unilaterally deciding whether to produce documents and information in discovery or to her client's litigation counsel without consulting with litigation partners in her own firm and who then decided these related issues incorrectly). The Undersigned has not concluded how to categorize RAL's conduct, but Rule 37 does not require bad faith. In fact, it does not require negligence. Instead, the rule establishes a "loser pays" presumption to discovery disputes. If Defendants or Plaintiff's current counsel believe that RAL should also be responsible for fees either under Rule 37, Section 1927 or the Court's inherent power, then they shall so advise RAL in writing within five days of this Order, so that RAL may address the position in its optional memorandum. Therefore, the optional memoranda will, at a minimum, address the propriety of a fees award against RAL under Rule 37 and may (depending on the parties' positions) also discuss fees under Section 1927 and the Court's inherent power.

fn 
22
In order to facilitate RAL's ability to timely submit an optional memorandum, Latele's current counsel shall forthwith provide a copy of this Order to RAL.

ROBIN S. ROSENBAUM 
ORDER OVERRULING PLAINTIFFS' OBJECTIONS TO THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE'S ORDERS DATED MARCH 1, 2013, AND MARCH 11, 2013
This matter is before the Court on Plaintiffs' Objections to the Magistrate Judge's Orders Dated March 1, 2013, and March 11, 2013, Concerning Plaintiffs' Requests for Electronic Document Production and Rule 30(b)(6) Depositions [D.E. 140]. Plaintiffs challenge the following rulings of the Honorable Barry S. Seltzer: (1) the scope of Plaintiffs' Rule 30(b)(6), Fed. R. Civ. P., depositions authorized by Judge Seltzer in his March 1, 2013, Order [D.E. 118]; (2) Judge Seltzer's denial of Plaintiffs' motion to compel the production of certain electronically stored information ("ESI") from additional custodians and to apply Plaintiffs' suggested search terms to the ESI files of such additional custodians, see D.E. 128, and (3) Judge Seltzer's March 1, 2013, Order [D.E. 117] granting Defendants' motion to compel Plaintiffs to provide individual responses to Defendants' first document requests.
The Court has carefully reviewed Judge Seltzer's Orders, the parties' filings, and the record in this matter and is otherwise duly advised in the premises. For the reasons set forth below, the Court now overrules Plaintiffs' Objections [D.E. 140].
The Court enjoys discretion over the control of discovery in a civil case. Johnson v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. of Ga., 263 F.3d 1234 , 1269 (11th Cir. 2001) (citation omitted). Under 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A) , a district judge "may designate a magistrate judge to hear and determine any pretrial matter pending before the court." 1 This includes non-dispositive discovery issues. Id .; see also S.D. Fla. L. Mag. J. R. 1(c) . If a party timely objects to the magistrate judge's ruling, the district judge must "modify or set aside any part of the order that is clearly erroneous or contrary to law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(a) ; 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A) ; S.D. Fla. L. Mag. J. R. 4(a)(1) .
"Clear error is a highly deferential standard of review." Holton v. City of Thomasville School Dist., 425 F.3d 1325 , 1350 (11th Cir. 2005) (citation omitted). [*3] To satisfy this standard, a court must conclude that, although enough evidence to support a finding may exist, the reviewing court "is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed." Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564 , 573 , 105 S. Ct. 1504 , 84 L. Ed. 2d 518 (1985) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). It is not enough, alone, that the reviewing court would have decided the matter differently. See Holton, 425 F.3d at 1351 . As for the contrary-to-law standard, "[a]n order is contrary to law when it fails to apply or misapplies relevant statutes, case law or rules of procedure." Tolz v. Geico Gen. Ins. Co., [2010 BL 17007], 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6709 , 2010 WL 184745 , *2 (S.D. Fla. Jan. 27, 2010) (citation omitted). With these standards in mind, the Court now turns to Plaintiffs' objections.
1. The Scope of Plaintiffs' Rule 30(b)(6), Fed. R. Civ. P., Depositions Authorized by Judge Seltzer in his March 1, 2013, Order [D.E. 118] 
In this Order, Judge Seltzer limited the scope of Plaintiffs' 30(b)(6), Fed. R. Civ. P., depositions to a list of eleven topics. Plaintiffs argue that these limitations prejudice their ability to prove that the putative class members are similarly situated.
The Court respectfully disagrees and notes that these limitations are not clearly erroneous or contrary to law. The topics listed cover a wide range of company procedures and should give Plaintiffs the ability to determine whether the different restaurant brands owned by Defendant Darden Restaurants, Inc., employ similar policies. Moreover, although Plaintiffs maintain that some of the excluded topics are relevant to the issue of enterprise liability under the Fair Labor Standards Act ("FLSA"), Defendants agreed to not oppose class certification on the grounds that some Defendants may not be covered entities under the FLSA. See D.E. 126 at 113. Finally, the Court agrees with Judge Seltzer that various findings of the Department of Labor on Defendants' tipped employees appear more relevant to damages than class certification. See D.E. 126 at 18. Thus, the Court declines to overturn this ruling.
2. Judge Seltzer's Denial of Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel the Production of Certain ESI from Additional Custodians and to Apply Plaintiffs' Suggested Search Terms to the ESI files of Such Additional Custodians 
In a separate Order, Judge Seltzer denied in part Plaintiffs' request for a broad range of electronically stored information regarding Defendants' middle and upper management. See D.E. 128. In particular, Judge Seltzer limited Plaintiffs to applying certain search terms to 34 data sets designated by Defendants. See id. Plaintiffs object to this ruling, contending that it denies them access to potentially responsive documents and emails and that Defendants failed to show that complying with Plaintiffs' request would have been unduly burdensome. In particular, Plaintiffs criticize the analysis Defendants performed to estimate the number of files that would be produced in response to Plaintiffs' request. While Defendants could have chosen a different or more exact methodology, the Court cannot conclude that the estimates they used were contrary to law or that, [*4] under the circumstances, it was not appropriate to engage in an estimating methodology. The Court therefore finds no clear error in Judge Seltzer's decision to narrow Plaintiffs' request.
3. Judge Seltzer's March 1, 2013, Order [D.E. 117] Granting Defendants' Motion to Compel Plaintiffs to Provide Individual Responses to Defendants' First Document Requests. 
After Plaintiffs filed a joint response to Defendants' first document requests, Judge Seltzer ordered Plaintiffs to submit individual responses. See D.E. 117. Plaintiffs assert that the responses are identical and it would be "absurd" to require separate but identical pleadings. However, when Judge Seltzer held oral arguments on this matter, counsel for Plaintiffs stated, "If Your Honor wants us to serve individual responses on behalf of each of the plaintiffs, we will serve individual responses on behalf of each of the plaintiffs." D.E. 126 at 29. Accordingly, Judge Seltzer's decision to order a response format agreed to by Plaintiffs was not erroneous, let alone clearly erroneous.
For the foregoing reasons, it is ORDERED and ADJUDGED that Plaintiffs' Objections to the Magistrate Judge's Orders Dated March 1, 2013, and March 11, 2013, Concerning Plaintiffs' Requests for Electronic Document Production and Rule 30(b)(6) Depositions [D.E. 140] are OVERRULED. 
DONE and ORDERED at Fort Lauderdale, Florida, this 10th day of April 2013.

JAMES D. WHITTEMORE 
ORDER
BEFORE THE COURT is Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment and Incorporated Memorandum of Law (Dkt. 14), and Plaintiff s response (Dkt. 17). Upon consideration, Defendant' s motion for summary judgment is GRANTED. The undisputed material evidence demonstrates that Plaintiff was terminated for a legitimate, non-pretextual reason.
I. BACKGROUND 
A. Robling's Employment
Carol Robling was employed as an Administrative Assistant by Defendant ITT Educational Services, Inc. ("ITT") from March 1991 until December 11, 2012 when ITT terminated her (Robling Dep. 24:5-6; 29:1-3). In 2007, Robling became an Administrative Assistant for Tampa Campus Director Dennis Alspauth (Id. 30:15-23). She was considered a good employee and trained other Administrative Assistants (Lynn Dep. 35:6-24). Among others, the essential functions of an Administrative Assistant included supporting the Campus Director and processing timecards and payroll reports. (Robling Dep. 50:5-16; Dkt. 14-5 at 14-15). Both Robling and coworker Tracey Jackson-Rice served as Administrative Assistants to Alspauth until he retired in January 2012. (Robling Dep. 30:24-25; 31:1-5). District Manager Sam Lynn believed that under Alspauth's leadership, the Tampa campus was poorly managed; received unsatisfactory or marginal audit results; Alspauth did not hold people accountable; and a lot of things at the Tampa Campus could have been fixed if he would have held some people accountable. (Lynn Dep. 22:9-23:3; 32:2-14; 123:6-18).
On April 23, 2012, Sheryl Gunning became the new Tampa Campus Director. (Gunning Decl. ¶ 1). Prior to April 23, 2012, Gunning was the Director at ITT's Pinellas County campus for 4 1/2 years. (Gunning Dep. 9:23-25). Lynn recommended Gunning for the Tampa Director position based upon her attention to compliance. (Lynn Dep. 26:6-10; 123:13-18). Both Robling (age 59) and Rice (age 43) became her Administrative Assistants. (Robling Dep. 35:16-17; Gunning Dep. 35:6-7). At that time, Gunning discussed with Robling and Rice the need to reduce down to only one Administrative Assistant (Robling Dep. 101:25-102:7). Gunning asked Robling her preference: remain her Administrative Assistant or move into the Marketing Administrative Assistant position or the Education/Nursing Administrative Assistant position (Id.; Dkt. 14-5 at 21). Robling decided to remain Gunning's Administrative Assistant and Gunning permitted her to stay in that position. (Robling Dep. 105:7-11; Dkt 14-5 at 21). Rice took the Education/Nursing Administrative Assistant job. (Id. 105:2-4). In connection with these discussions, on or about June 15, 2012, Robling claims [*2] she overheard Gunning say to Rice that she would prefer Rice to be the Marketing Administrative Assistant because "Tracey is young, looks sexy, and smiles." (Dkt. 14-5 at 21).
B. ITT's Policies
ITT has a Corrective Action policy which provides in pertinent part:
Counseling employees is a preliminary step that, depending upon the severity of the employee's performance deficiency or inappropriate conduct, may be taken prior to formal corrective action and should be conducted when the supervisor considers counseling necessary to bring an employee's performance or conduct to the expected level. ... All counseling must be documented on the standard counseling form. ...
[C]ompleted Counseling Forms related to the performance and/or conduct at issue must be submitted to the Human Resources Department when the supervisor seeks to initiate corrective action.
Written warnings may occur after an employee fails to satisfy work performance and/or conduct expectations, or if prior counseling related to work performance and/or conduct problem(s) has not been successful. The Human Resources Department will determine whether a written warning is the appropriate corrective action under the circumstances.
. . .
Corrective action determinations will depend on the nature and severity of: the employee's conduct, performance and/or record; the frequency with which the performance and/or conduct at issue has occurred; and any other extenuating circumstances.
. . .
ITT/ESI in its sole discretion, will determine the corrective action. ITT/ESI may repeat, modify or omit levels of corrective action based on its assessment of the facts of the specific situation.
. . .
A final written warning... may occur when:... ITT/ESI determines that the nature of the work performance or conduct requires more than a written warning.
. . .
Termination of an employee's employment can occur at any time in the sole discretion of ITT/ESI, including, without limitation, if ITT/ESI determines that the requirements of a final written warning are not met or a counseling, a written warning or a final warning is not sufficient. All terminations of employment must be approved in advance [by] the Director of Human Resources.
(Dkt. 14-5 at 11-13). Robling was familiar with all of these policies which were readily accessible on ITT's intranet. (Dkt. 14-4, Robling Dep. Dkt. 14-4,40:15-20; 45:13-46:9; 46:13-22; 47:13-24; 49:24-50:1, Sept. 11, 2014). Robling also testified she understood that ITT could forego counseling and go right to termination, depending on the seriousness of the offense. (Robling Dep. 71:19-25). ITT also had a vacation policy requiring that all vacation time be requested in advance and in writing, and to the extent possible, be made at least two weeks in advance. (Dkt. 14-7, Gunning Decl. ¶3, Ex. A). Every manager and supervisor is responsible for approving a request for vacation time and authorizing the Payroll Department's payment of vacation time. Id. ITT's sick time policy requires every supervisor to approve in advance (to the extent possible), document, and authorize all sick time taken by an employee. (Id. ¶4, Ex. [*3] B; Dkt. 17-5, Gunning Dep. 46:8-47:12).

C. Robling's Discipline History, Complaints, and Termination
At ITT, the established payroll process is as follows: every other Friday, employees or supervisors would turn in their timecards or their department's timecards to Robling; she would check them for the supervisor's authorizing signature; put them in order; give them to Gunning for her final approval and signature; and Robling would then submit the approved timecards to the Payroll Department by the following Monday afternoon. (Robling Dep. 55:2-25; 56:1-2).
On June 28, 2012, Gunning sent an e-mail to Robling inquiring why three employees' vacation and sick time were posted to the payroll register differently than what Gunning had approved. (Dkt. 14-5 at 17). Gunning wrote: "If a timecard needs revisions after they have been approved, I need to review them again." (Id.) Robling replied that one employee (Egan Hanson) "did not have any sick time left, so he had to take a vacation day. The others I submitted incorrectly." Id.; (Robling Dep. 74:13-25; 75:3). During her deposition, Robling admitted to making these payroll errors, which required three Pay Correction Forms to fix. (Id. 79:13-15; 80:21-25). Gunning also wrote: "the supervisor has to approve using vacation instead of sick time. We should not automatically be switching it.... No sick time = time without pay." (Dkt. 14-5 at 16). In the June 28 e-mail, Gunning told Robling "I am trying to reset some of the thinking when it comes to sick time and vacation time.... Please help me try to change the current environment." (Id.) That day, Gunning filled out a Counseling Form to document the issue, and pursuant to the Corrective Action Policy, it was placed in Robling's personnel file. (Gunning Decl. ¶7; Dkt. 14-5 at 18-19). Gunning wrote that Robling
keyed in vacation time instead of sick time for Egan Hanson . . . without getting approval from Egan's supervisor or the Director. When questioned why... Robling replied that the employee was out of sick time so she just made the adjustment. She mentioned that this behavior has always been done in the past.
(Id.)

The following day, June 29, 2012, Robling called Gunning's supervisor, Lynn, stating there were problems in Tampa, including a hostile work environment, age and sexual discrimination. (Robling Dep. 85:7-14).1 Lynn asked Robling to e-mail her grievances to him. (Id 85:15-22). That evening, Robling sent a timeline (see Dkt. 14-5 at 20-21). (Id. 86:5-12). Robling's timeline identified a number of incidents with Gunning she deemed inappropriate, include that on June 21, 2012, when Gunning gave Robling a choice of positions, Gunning stated she preferred Rice as the Marketing Administrative Assistant because "Tracey is young, looks sexy, and smiles."2 (Dkt. 14-5 at 20-21) (emphasis in original).
Also on June 29, 2012, Rice sent her own written complaint to Lynn, stating, among other things, that on June 15, 2012, Gunning told Rice she should be marketing secretary "because [Rice is] cute and sexy and 80% of our students are male" (emphasis in original). (Dkt. 14-5 at 27). Rice testified, however, that Gunning's comment was that she wanted Rice as the Marketing Administrative [*4] Assistant because Rice is "cute and sexy and 80% of our students are male." (Rice Dep. 33:17-23,34:13-18; Dkt. 14-5 at 27). Rice testified later that "as much as Cheryl rambled, she could have said both" "young and sexy" and "cute and sexy" and that Robling could have heard it. (Rice Dep. 162:4-22). Within a week, Lynn met with Robling and Rice in person. (Lynn Dep. 51:5-8, 52:8). Lynn also discussed the complaint with ITT's Human Resources Department ("HR") and spoke with Gunning about her style of communication. (Id. 57:7-9; 58:2-8, 61:24-62).
On July 3, 2012, Gunning forwarded an e-mail from ITT's Sr. Vice President of Operations Barry Simich to the Tampa Managers and Administrative Assistants, including Robling. (Gunning Decl. ¶6; Dkt. 14-7 at 13-16). The e-mail directed: (1) what the standard campus hours should be (starting at 7:30 am Monday through Thursday); and (2) that the decision to schedule employees' work hours outside the approved campus hours should be made after consultation with a District Manager. (Dkt. 14-7 at 15).
On July 10, 2012, Robling sent an e-mail to Gunning stating: "According to Annette [Barnes, in payroll] there is no policy that an employee cannot take a vacation day if they are out of sick time." (DKt. 14-5 at 29-30). Gunning replied "I would still like a supervisor to be involved in the approval process of any employee who is unable to work their posted schedule." (Id.)
On July 16, 2012, Gunning sent an inquiry to Annette Barnes in payroll about two employee's over-use of vacation time as sick time, and she copied Robling. (Dkt. 14-5 at 31-32). Annette wrote back that an employee can go up to 40 hours in arrears for vacation, adding that "The employee's supervisor or campus director can approve the vacation time." (Id.)
On July 20, 2012, Gunning asked Robling to assist her in ITT's "VIP Initiative" by contacting VIPs, such as elected officials, to arrange a visit. (Dkt. 14-5 at 33-34). Robling responded "I had thought you had e-mailed Tracey [Rice] before this on helping [Community Relations Specialist] Tou Lee. I am a little confused." (Id.) Gunning replied by again asking Plaintiff to help since Tracey was now the Education Secretary. (Id.) Robling replied "I thought [Rice] was marketing, too." (Id.) In her deposition, Robling testified she never arranged anything for the VIP Initiative. (Robling Dep. 138:21-23).That same day, Gunning prepared another Counseling Form which was placed in Robling's personnel file. (Gunning Decl. ¶7). Gunning wrote that Robling was unsupportive of her directives regarding sick-to-vacation time and was uncooperative in fulfilling Gunning's request to assist in VIP campus visits. (Dkt. 14-5 at 35-36).
On July 25, 2012, Robling sent her timeline to Simich. (Dkt. 14-5 at 37). Robling wrote that Lynn had not properly handled her initial complaint and that she is still afraid of retribution. (Id.) The timeline added on to her first timeline to include the dates from May 1, 2012 - July 20, 2012. (Dkt. 14-5 at 20-22; Robling Dep. 145:18-22).
HR received Robling's timeline, and in August 2012, Human Resources Director Christopher Bennett called Plaintiff to discuss her concerns. (Robling Dep. 147:11-14). During this conversation, Robling recounted: [*5] the "young and sexy comment;" overheard Gunning say she was not sure Robling could do her job; Gunning wanted younger people at the front desk; they all thought it was a hostile work environment; and she thought Gunning was retaliating against her with the timecards. (Id. 148:1-149:1). Gunning testified she was aware that Robling and Rice complained about her, but she was not aware of any age discrimination allegations. (Gunning Dep. 91:10-25).
On September 24, 2012, Robling submitted a timecard for Rice requesting vacation pay to ITT's Payroll Department prior to Gunning signing the timecard in approval. (Dkt. 14-5 at 38-41). Robling admitted a Pay Correction Form had to be submitted to fix her error. (Robling Dep. 167:2-4). On September 25, 2012, Natalie Hay at HQ suggested that Gunning speak with HR Partner James Anders about issuing a written warning to both Robling and Rice. (Gunning Decl. ¶8, Ex. D).
On the October 2012 work schedule, Robling changed her work start time without approval to begin at 7:15 am and shortened her lunch break in order to leave early on Fridays. (Dkt. 14-5 at 48-49). On October 2, 2012, Lynn e-mailed Gunning with his displeasure with Tampa's work schedule, writing "I fail to understand why we cannot seem to follow basic direction given You have an Admin coming in at 7:15 .... There is nothing that occurs earlier than 7:30 that cannot be completed during regular hours" and Lynn directed Gunning to adjust the schedule. (Dkt. 14-5 at 42-43). Gunning forwarded the e-mail to Robling, asking her to ensure her hours begin at 7:30 a.m. (Dkt. 14-5 at 42-45). Robling replied "In that fifteen minutes I can do things like the mail."(DKt. 14-5 at 45). Gunning responded that she would not approve work schedules that begin before 7:30 a.m. (Id.)
On October 25, 2012, Robling took an unscheduled and unapproved vacation day when she forgot what days she scheduled her vacation. (Dkt. 14-5 at 47-49). At the recommendation and encouragement of Lynn, and pursuant to ITT's Corrective Action policy, on October 30, 2012, Gunning completed Section I of a Corrective Action Form based on the above conduct. (Dkt. 14-5 at 47-48; Gunning Dep. 149:10-12). Gunning did not fill in Section II or the type of corrective action, as that is determined by HR. (Dkt. 14-5 at 47-48; Anders Dep. 15:25-16:9). Gunning was concerned that Robling was doing what she wanted to do based on how she did it in the past, and not adapting to Gunning's requests. (Gunning Dep. 68:3-6).
After reviewing the documents HR Partner James Anders determined a Final Written Warning was appropriate. (Dkt. 14-5 at 47-48; Anders Dep. 18:5-20, 68:15-19). Anders explained that Robling's conduct indicated "clear signs that she did not accept [Gunning's] authority" and intentionally disregarded Gunning's directives, which are not matters of performance. (Anders Dep. 59:20-60:22,64:12-17). Anders also explained that with conduct issues, "the expectation is they can never, ever do that kind of conduct again." (Id. 28:7-9).
When presented with the Final Written Warning, Robling refused to sign it and told Gunning it was bogus, retaliation, and that Gunning was a micromanager. (Robling Dep. 174:13-22; Dkt. 14-5 at 48). [*6] Robling refused to speak with Gunning and when she left the office, announced loudly "I got a Final Written Warning." (Id. 178:3-12; 189:15-24).
On October 31, 2012, Robling complained via e-mail to several senior management personnel at HQ about the warning, claiming it was retaliation for her earlier complaints of June 28 and July 25, 2012. (Dkt. 14-5 at 49-50). In the e-mail, Robling admitted to submitting Rice's timecard with vacation pay without Gunning's final approval; admitted she unilaterally changed her working hours (claiming that in April Gunning told her she did not care how she made up the Friday time); and admitted she forgot which days she put in for vacation. (Id.) Robling also stated: "The Tampa campus director should empower its employees, let them do their jobs as have done before, not cut them down with constant emails that they are doing something wrong." (Id.) To investigate Robling's concerns, Anders spoke with Lynn, and Lynn testified that Robling's conduct was significant enough to recommend that Gunning put Robling on corrective action.3 (Lynn Dep. 87:13-88:15). Anders testified he conducted a full and fair investigation of Robling's complaints and concluded that Robling was very upset that Gunning was a micromanager and very deep into the weeds of Tampa's operations. (Anders Dep. 15:4-7, 51:22-25).
On November 1, 2012, Bennett and Anders spoke with Robling about her e-mail complaint. (Robling Dep. 188:5-17). Robling testified that she told them Gunning was retaliating against her, targeting her, and creating a hostile work environment. (Id. 188:16-21). Robling requested via e-mail "a synopsis of our conversation" and Bennett replied that he and Anders spent considerable time reviewing her complaint and listening to her objections; explained to her why she received a Final Written Warning; and they offered Robling suggestions to improve her working relationship with Gunning by demonstrating that she is working with her rather that working counter to her direction. (Dkt. 14-5 at 54-55). Robling admitted Bennett's e-mail was what he said during the call. (Robling Dep. 188:22-189:1).
In early November 2012, Robling submitted to the Payroll Department incorrect vacation time and sick time for Instructor Lori Barnes without obtaining Gunning's final approval.(See Dkt. 14-5 at 52-53; Gunning Dep. 177:25-178:25,179:11-25). In her deposition, Robling admitted she changed the hours from vacation to sick time on Barnes' timecard without Gunning's final approval prior to submitting to the Payroll Department. (Robling Dep. 184:8-185:9; 77:7-16). As a result, Gunning processed another Corrective Action Form, with supporting documentation, and sent it to HR. (Gunning Decl. ¶12, Ex. F).
After the final Corrective Action Form, which Anders interpreted as a request from Gunning to terminate Robling (see Dkt. 14-2 at 7-8; Anders Dep. 77:24-78:24), but before terminating Robling, Bennett and Anders discussed Anders going back and making certain that had everything right. (Bennett Dep. 65:1-17). Bennett sent an e-mail to Anders stating that he wanted "to be certain that Sheryl [Gunning] is correct [*7] with the direction she has given Carol [Robling]." (Dkt. 14-2 at 5-6). After verifying that Robling was trained on the payroll processing procedures, Bennett approved Robling's termination. (Id. at 7). Lynn also suggested to Anders that Robling's employment be terminated. (Lynn Dep. 85:23-86:6).
On December 11, 2012, ITT terminated the employment of Robling for violating Workplace Standards for failing to follow the directives of the supervisor. (Dkt. 1 ¶ 16; Dkt. 4116). About two months after Robling's termination, Gunning hired Nadia Diaz (in her twenties) as her Administrative Assistant. (Gunning Dep. 102: 13-25). In September 2014, Ms. Charron Wickham (now age 61) was transferred from the St. Pete campus based on her seniority to become Gunning's Administrative Assistant. (Gunning Dep. 103:12-25; Wickham Dep. 6:19-7:7).
Robling filed a charge of discrimination with the EEOC and brought this lawsuit, contending age discrimination in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act ("ADEA") and the Florida Civil Rights Act ("FCRA") and retaliation in violation of the ADEA, FCRA, and Title VII. (Dkt. 1).
II. STANDARD 
Summary judgment is appropriate where "there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a) . "A genuine factual dispute exists only if a reasonable fact-finder' could find by a preponderance of the evidence that the [non-movant] is entitled to a verdict.'" Kernel Records Oy v. Mosley, 694 F.3d 1294 , 1300 (11th Cir. 2012) (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242 , 252 , 106 S. Ct. 2505 , 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986)). A fact is material if it may affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law. Allen v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 121 F.3d 642 , 646 (11th Cir. 1997). All the evidence and factual inferences reasonably drawn from the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144 , 157 , 90 S. Ct. 1598 , 26 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1970); Jackson v. BellSouth Telecomms., 372 F.3d 1250 , 1280 (11th Cir. 2004).
Once a party properly makes a summary judgment motion by demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact, the nonmoving party must go beyond the pleadings through the use of affidavits, depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on file, and designate specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317 , 322 , 106 S. Ct. 2548 , 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). Plaintiffs evidence must be significantly probative to support the claims. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249 .
The Court will not weigh the evidence or make findings of fact. Morrison v. Amway Corp., 323 F.3d 920 , 924 (11th Cir. 2003). Rather, the Court's role is limited to deciding whether there is sufficient evidence upon which a reasonable juror could find for the non-moving party. Id .
III. DISCUSSION 
Robling brings claims of age discrimination and retaliation under the ADEA and FCRA and a retaliation claim under Title VII. ADEA and FCRA claims are analyzed under the same standards. See Drago v. Jenne, 453 F.3d 1301 , 1307 (11th Cir. 2006). ITT contends Robling does not have direct evidence of age discrimination, cannot establish a prima facie case through circumstantial evidence, and cannot prove pretext. As to Robling's retaliation claims, ITT contends that Robling cannot establish a causal connection [*8] between the protected activity and the adverse action, and as required for Title VII retaliation claims, has no evidence that ITT would not have terminated her but for her complaints.
A. Robling's Age Discrimination Claims
The ADEA makes it "unlawful for an employer to" "discharge any individual... because of such individual's age." 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1) . To establish a claim of unlawful age discrimination under the ADEA, a "plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence ... that age was the 'but-for' cause of the challenged employer decision." Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., 557 U.S. 167 , 177-78 , 129 S.Ct. 2343 , 2351 , 174 L.Ed.2d 119 (2009). A plaintiff may prove her prima facie case "through direct or circumstantial evidence." Kragor v. Takeda Pharms. Am., Inc.., 702 F.3d 1304 , 1308 (11th Cir. 2012).
i. Robling Has Not Submitted Direct Evidence of Age Discrimination 
Robling contends that Gunning's comments about Rice being "young and sexy," Robling not being able to perform her job due to her age, and that Gunning wanted a younger assistant are direct evidence of age discrimination. They are not.
A plaintiff may establish a prima facie case of discrimination through direct evidence. Damon v. Fleming Supermarkets of Fla., Inc., 196 F.3d 1354 , 1358 (11th Cir. 1999); Williamson v. Adventist Health Sys./Sunbelt, Inc., 372 Fed. App'x 936 , 940 (11th Cir. 2010). The Eleventh Circuit has defined direct evidence "as evidence which reflects a discriminatory or retaliatory attitude correlating to the discrimination or retaliation complained of by the employee." Damon, 196 F.3d at 1359 . "Only the most blatant remarks, whose intent could be nothing other than to discriminate on the basis of age, constitute direct evidence of discrimination." Van Voorhis v. Hillsborough County Bd. of County Comm'rs, 512 F.3d 1296 , 1300 (11th Cir. 2008) (quoting Carter v. City of Miami, 870 F.2d 578 , 582 (11th Cir. 1989) (alterations omitted)). Statements such as "[I don't] want to hire any old pilots," "Fire Early-he is too old," or "when the position open[s] up, the company [will] be looking for a person younger than Lindsey to fill it" constitute direct evidence of age discrimination. Id .; Earley v. Champion Ml Corp., 907 F.2d 1077 , 1081 (11th Cir. 1990) ; Lindsey v. American Cast Iron Pipe Co., 772 F.2d 799 , 801-02 (11th Cir. 1985). To qualify as direct evidence of discrimination, the biased statement by a decision-maker must be made concurrently with the adverse employment event, such that no inference is necessary to conclude that the bias necessarily motivated the decision. Damon, 196 F.3d at 1359 (the statement "what the company needed was aggressive young men ... to be promoted," did not constitute direct evidence of discrimination," because "the comment still requires us to infer that [the defendant's] interest in promoting young men motivated his decision to terminate [the plaintiff].").
Even if Gunning made the comment that she preferred Rice because she was "sexy, young, and cute," it was made almost 5 1/2 months prior to Robling's termination. And, even after supposedly making this comment, Gunning kept Robling as her administrative assistant. This statement therefore requires an inference to conclude that ITT intended to terminate Robling because of Gunning's preference for younger employees. Similarly, any comments Gunning may have made about wanting a younger assistant [*9] are too attenuated from Robling's termination to constitute direct evidence. Finally, the alleged vague comments Rice testified Gunning made about Robling having problems performing her job because of her age are also not enough.4 "'Congress made plain that the age statute was not meant to prohibit employment decisions based on factors that sometimes accompany advancing age, such as declining health or diminished vigor and competence.'" Templeton v. Bessemer Water Serv., 154 Fed. App'x 759 , 762 (11th Cir. 2005) (quoting Young v. Gen. Foods Corp., 840 F.2d 825 , 829 (11th Cir.1988)). Robling must therefore establish a prima facie case through circumstantial evidence.
ii. Robling Can Make Out A Prima Facie Case Using Circumstantial Evidence 
ADEA Claims based on circumstantial evidence are evaluated under the McDonnell Dougles burden-shifting analysis. See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 , 802-05 , 93 S. Ct. 1817 , 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). Under McDonnell Douglas, a plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination. Kragor v. Takeda Pharms. Am., Inc.., 702 F.3d 1304 , 1308 (11th Cir. 2012). To establish a prima facie case, the plaintiff must show that: (1) she was a member of the protected group of persons between the ages of forty and seventy; (2) she was subject to an adverse employment action; (3) a substantially younger person filled the position from which she was discharged; and (4) she was qualified to do the job from which she was discharged. Damon, 196 F.3d at 1359 .
ITT argues that Robling cannot demonstrate the fourth element. ITT contends there is no dispute that Robling did not meet ITT's legitimate expectations at the time of her termination because she repeatedly failed to follow the directives of Gunning. This is the same conduct ITT relies on to assert it had a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Robling. Robling contends there is sufficient evidence demonstrating that Robling was qualified to do her job as she had been doing for over 21 years and that her previous performance evaluations show that she was performing above standards.
An individual is "qualified" for a position, for purposes of employment discrimination law, if she meets the criteria that the employer has specified for the position focusing on the plaintiffs skills and background. Wright v. Southland Corp., 187 F.3d 1287 , 1306 (11th Cir. 1999); Clark v. Coats & Clark, Inc., 990 F.2d 1217 , 1227 (11th Cir.1993). The fourth element may be established by evidence that the plaintiff has performed her responsibilities for several years without complaint. Baker v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 903 F.2d 1515 , 1520 (11th Cir. 1990).
Defendant relies on Holifield v. Reno, 115 F.3d 1 555, 1565 (11th Cir. 1997), for the proposition that Robling must be performing well at the time of her termination. However, the court made that determination in assessing pretext, not the plaintiffs prima facie case. And, the Eleventh Circuit has held that "allegations of poor performance against plaintiffs discharged from long-held positions may be properly considered, only after a prima facie case has been established, when a court evaluates the pretextual nature of an employer's proffered nondiscriminatory reasons for termination." Damon, 196 F.3d at 1360 (district court incorrectly [*10] considered the defendant's allegations of the plaintiffs poor performance).5 
Robling worked for ITT for 21 years and received high performance ratings. Lynn considered her an invaluable asset and recommended her to train other administrative assistants. A jury could therefore reasonably conclude Robling was qualified for the position.
Next, ITT contends that Robling cannot argue that ITT's discipline was an adverse employment action. Specifically, that Gunning's emails to Robling and the Final Written Warning do not constitute adverse action because they did not affect her compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, deprive her of opportunities, or adversely affect her status. However, there is no dispute that Robling suffered an adverse employment action when she was terminated.6 Therefore, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Robling, the jury could determine that she makes a prima facie case of age discrimination.
iii. Robling n' s Termination Was Legitimate and Not Pretextual 
Robling fails to overcome ITT's legitimate, non-discriminatory justification for her termination. ITT bears the burden of establishing that Robling was terminated for legitimate reasons, and if it does so, the burden shifts to Robling to show that ITT's reasons were pretextual. See Chapman, 229 F.3d at 1024 ;  Damon, 196 F.3d at 1361 ("We have repeatedly and emphatically held that a defendant may terminate an employee for a good or bad reason without violating federal law. . . . We are not in the business of adjudging whether employment decisions are prudent or fair. Instead, our sole concern is whether unlawful [retaliation] motivates a challenged employment decision.")
ITT's contends it terminated Robling for violating Workplace Standards by failing to follow the directives of her supervisor, Gunning. It is undisputed that pursuant to ITT's policies, an employee can be terminated "at any time in the sole discretion of ITT/ESI, including, without limitation, if ITT/ESI determines that the requirements of a final written warning are not met or a counseling, a written warning or a final warning is not sufficient. All terminations of employment must be approved in advance [by] the Director of Human Resources" (Dkt. 14-5 at 11-13).
Robling has not carried her burden of establishing that ITT's stated reason for termination was pretextual. She is required to "demonstrate such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence." Rioux v. City of Atlanta, Ga., 520 F.3d 1269 , 1275 (11th Cir. 2008) (quoting Combs v. Plantation Patterns, 106 F.3d 1519 , 1538 (11th Cir. 1997)). She must do so in the "form of specific facts" that show the employer's reasons were pretextual. Wilcox v. Corr. Corp. of Am., 603 Fed. Appx. 862 , [2015 BL 64887], 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 3768 , at * 11 (11th Cir. Mar. 11, 2015) (quoting Bryant v. Jones, 575 F.3d 1281 , 1308 (11th Cir. 2009)). Rather than simply disputing the facts underlying her termination, Robling must show that ITT did not truly rely on the proffered reasons. See Damon, 196 F.3d at 1363 n.3 (11th Cir. 1999) ("An employer [*11] who fires an employee under the mistaken but honest impression that the employee violated a work rule is not liable for discriminatory conduct.") Therefore, the inquiry on pretext centers on the employer's "good faith belief," not the employee's interpretation of the events. E.E.O.C v. Total Sys. Servs., Inc., 221 F.3d 1171 , 1176 (11th Cir. 2000).
Applying this standard, Robling is unable to demonstrate that ITT did not honestly believe she had violated Workplace Standards by failing to comply with Gunning's directives. Robling's contentions about her beliefs-that she did follow Gunning's directives - cast no doubt on ITT's motivations. And Robling's interpretation of how ITT's discipline process should have been implemented is of no moment. [See Dkt. 17 at 18-19). Accordingly, Robling has failed to carry her burden of demonstrating that ITT's reasons for her termination were pretextual.7 
B. Retaliation 
To establish a prima facie case of retaliation, a plaintiff must show (1) he engaged in statutorily protected activity, (2) suffered a materially adverse employment action, and (3) there was a causal relationship between the two events. See Kidd v. Mando Am. Corp., 731 F.3d 1196 , 1211 (11th Cir. 2013); Goldsmith v. Bagby Elevator Co., Inc., 513 F.3d 1261 , 1277 (11th Cir. 2008). If Robling can establish a prima facie case of retaliation, ITT then bears the burden to establish a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the adverse action. Coutu v. Martin County Bd. of County Com 'rs, 47 F.3d 1068 , 1075 n. 54 (11th Cir. 1995). And if ITT is able to do so, Robling then must establish the reasons given by ITT were a pretext for retaliation. Chapman, 229 F.3d at 1024 . As explained below, summary judgment is due to be granted to ITT, because even though Robling is able to demonstrate a prima facie case of retaliation, ITT established a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason to terminate her, and Robling cannot establish ITT's reasons were actually pretextual.
i. Robling Can Make a Prima Facie Case of Retaliation Under the ADEA 
ITT contends that Robling cannot establish a causal connection between her complaints and her termination. ITT does not dispute that Robling engaged in statutorily protected activity and suffered a materially adverse employment action. Robling's June 2012 email complaint was protected conduct and her December 2012 termination was an adverse decision. Robling also contends that the October 2012 Final Written Warning was an adverse action and that her July 2012 complaint to Simich and October 31, 2012 complaint to HR in connection with her Final Written Warning was protected conduct.8 Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Robling, the June, July, and October internal complaints constituted statutorily protected activity. Therefore, Robling must demonstrate a causal relationship between that protected activity and her termination in December 2012.
The requirement of a causal link is "broadly" construed. Higdon v. Jackson, 393 F.3d 1211 , 1220 (11th Cir. 2004). Indeed, a plaintiff need only show that the protected conduct and adverse employment action "are not completely unrelated." Olmsted v. Taco Bell Corp., 141 F.3d 1457 , 1460 (11th Cir. 1998) (quoting EEOC v. Reichhold Chems., Inc.[*12] ., 988 F.2d 1564 , 1571-72 (11th Cir. 1993)). To demonstrate a causal relationship, a plaintiff must demonstrate the adverse decision was made by a person with knowledge of the protected expression, and that there is evidence tending to show causation or a close temporal proximity between the protected express and the adverse action. Higdon, 393 F.3d at 1220 . A close temporal proximity has been interpreted to include as long as one month, but periods of three or four months have been deemed too protracted. Brown v. Alabama De't of Transportation, 597 F.3d 1160 , 1182 (11th Cir. 2010). An ultimate adverse action can be linked to temporally distant protected expression if there is a chain of intervening retaliatory acts between the two. See Bass v. Bd. Of Cnty. Comm'rs, Orange Cnty., Fla., 256 F.3d 1095 , 1117-19 (11th Cir. 2001) (overruled on other grounds by Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53 , 126 S. Ct. 2405 , 165 L. Ed. 2d 345 (2006)).
Robling has not demonstrated through direct evidence a causal link between the protected conduct in June, July and October, and her December termination. Instead, she attempts to temporally link her protected conduct by showing close temporal proximity between the protected expression and the adverse action. Namely, the October complaint and the December termination.9 
A jury could find that Robling engaged in protected activity as late as November 1, 2012, and thereafter was terminated on December 11, 2012, less than two months later. Therefore, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Robling, the jury could determine that she makes out a prima facie case of retaliation. See Farley v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 197 F.3d 1322 , 1337 (11th Cir. 1999) (seven-week interval between protected activity and adverse action sufficiently proximate to create a causal nexus for purposes of establishing a prima facie case).
However, as discussed, Robling cannot demonstrate pretext to overcome ITT's legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for her termination. Therefore, ITT is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on her ADEA and FCRA retaliation claims.
ii. Robling Cannot Make a Prima Facie Case of Retaliation Under Title VII 
To establish a claim of retaliation under Title VII, Robling must prove but-for causation—that the unlawful retaliation would not have occurred in the absence of the protected activity. Univ. of Tex. Southwestern Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, 570 U.S. ___ , 133 S. Ct. 2517 , 2533-34 186 L. Ed. 2d 503 (2013); Smith v. City of New Smyrna Beach, 588 Fed. Appx. 965 , 981 (11th Cir. 2014). Robling has not addressed this standard nor has she identified any evidence that ITT would not have terminated her but for her complaints. Therefore, she fails to create a triable issue with respect to her Title VII claim and ITT is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
Accordingly, Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. 14) is GRANTED. The Clerk is directed to enter final judgment in Defendant's favor and CLOSE the file.
DONE AND ORDERED this 16th day of April, 2015.

Robling also mischaracterizes portions of Rice's testimony regarding Gunning's comments. Rice did not testify that Gunning herself stated she wanted a younger assistant, referring to the age of Robling (Dkt. 17 at 4). Rather, Rice testified that Rice believed Gunning wanted a younger assistant. (Rice Dep. 47:4-9). Robling also claims that Rice testified that Gunning made age related comments about Robling during manager meetings (Dkt. 17 at 4). However, her testimony indicates that any such comments were related to Robling's performance, disabilities, or health problems due to her age. As discussed, Congress did not intend to prohibit employment decisions based on factors that may accompany advanced age. See Templeton, 154 Fed. App'x at 762 .

Jonathan Goodman 
ORDER DENYING PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT
In the instant copyright infringement case, Plaintiff, Latele Television, C.A. ("Plaintiff" or "Latele") seeks a partial summary judgment on the issue of ownership of the copyrighted work at issue, a Venezuelan telenovela named "Maria Maria." In its motion [ECF No. 170], Latele asks the Court to conclude that it is the rightful owner of a valid copyright in Maria Maria. The Undersigned has reviewed the motion, Defendants'1 response [ECF No. 188] and Plaintiff's reply [ECF No. 207]. The Undersigned denies the motion. Not only is the ownership issue still in dispute, but it is one of the most vigorously litigated issues in the case.
In fact, although the Undersigned recently denied Defendants' motion to dismiss (which asserted the argument that Latele did not own Maria Maria when it filed this lawsuit), the Order denying that motion expressly noted that "Latele will need to establish at trial its standing to pursue the lawsuit. In other words, it will need to prove that it exclusively owned the rights to Maria Maria on the day it filed the lawsuit." [ECF No. 368, p. 15, n. 13]. Likewise, in analyzing the competing evidence surrounding Defendants' argument that Latele does not own the Maria Maria copyright because of certain purported transfers, the Undersigned described the theories as "big 'ifs'" and specifically noted that "they cannot be resolved now because there is evidence to support both sides' positions." [ECF No. 368, p. 21].
Given these comments about factual disputes in the Order denying the motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction -- an order issued long [*2] after the instant motion for partial summary judgment was filed -- no one should be surprised by this ruling which denies the partial summary judgment motion because of factual disputes. Although there are several factual disputes which would preclude a partial summary judgment in favor of either party on the copyright ownership issue, this Order will focus only on the transfers (and purported unwinding of the transfers) which were previously at issue in the no-longer-pending motion to dismiss (and which were the subject of substantial testimony at an evidentiary hearing).2 
I. Factual Background 
In its Complaint, Latele alleges different types of copyright infringement by Defendants of the popular Maria Maria ("MM" or "Maria Maria") telenovela, a Spanish-language soap opera. In particular, the works at issue are 198 episodes of television programming allegedly owned by Latele, originally airing in 1989, and 178 episodes of television programming allegedly aired by Defendants. El Rostro de Analia ("El Rostro") is the allegedly infringing work. Latele alleges that Defendants hired the author of Maria Maria to develop El Rostro, a telenovela which Latele alleges is so similar to Maria Maria that the public and press have designated it as a remake or retelling. Latele's three-count Complaint pursues claims for copyright infringement, contributory copyright infringement and vicarious copyright infringement. [ECF No. 1, pp. 15-22].
On April 1, 2012, Luis Villanueva, as President and Chief Executive Officer of Somos Distribution, LLC ("Somos"), Latele's "exclusive distributor," and Fernando Fraiz (Latele's president and principal), on behalf of himself, individually, and on behalf of LaTele and Marte TV (Latele's prior name), executed and entered into an "Assumption Agreement," drafted in the form of a letter addressed to LaTele Productions, Inc. ("Latele US"). Latele US is a separate corporation, owned by Fraiz, which has never been a party to this lawsuit. [ECF No. 166-1, pp. 34-39].
The Assumption Agreement documents a formal and unconditional amendment to a prior Distribution Agreement between Somos, LaTele, Marte TV, and Fernando Fraiz. Id. The Assumption Agreement's purpose was to effectuate the parties' "interest[] in transferring certain rights to LaTele US in order to facilitate the licensing of the rights to the Content [including Maria Maria] to third parties" and "LaTele US['s] wish[] to assume and become bound by the Agreement (as amended) and assume all the rights and obligations of the Licensor as provided therein." [ Id. at p. 34]. It was executed by Fernando Fraiz four times: on behalf of Marte TV; on behalf of LaTele Venezuela (i.e., the Plaintiff); on behalf of himself, individually; and on behalf of LaTele US. [ Id. at p. 36].
Maria Maria is the first of eight (8) novelas specifically identified in the Assumption Agreement as content to be distributed by Somos. [ Id. at p. 34].
Less than four months before Plaintiff filed this action, Fraiz, Plaintiff's principal and highest authority [ECF No. 324, pp. 26, 252-53], entered into three transactions involving Maria Maria, including: ([*3] 1) the First Assignment -- a document dated April 18, 2012 that on its face transferred all rights in Maria Maria from Plaintiff to Fraiz personally; (2) the Second Assignment -- a second document dated April 18, 2012 that on its face transferred all rights in Maria Maria from Fraiz personally to Latele US; and (3) a third document dated April 18, 2012 that authorized Fraiz to enter into the Second Assignment on behalf of Latele US (the "Joint Consent"). [ECF No. 324, pp. 81-88]. The First Assignment, Second Assignment, and Joint Consent are collectively referred to as the "Transfer Documents."3 
In the Second Assignment, Mr. Fraiz, personally, is identified as the "Transferor," and "the holder of all copyrights and rights to the originally produced soap operas listed in Exhibit A hereto . . . ." [ECF No. 166-1, p. 53]. Exhibit A to the Second Assignment identifies Maria Maria as the first of eight novelas subject to that Agreement. [ Id. at p. 59]. It identifies LaTele US as the "Transferee." [ Id. at p. 53]. Paragraph (1) of the Second Assignment, entitled "Assignment and Transfer" (emphasis in original) reflects that Fraiz, as Transferor, "hereby unconditionally and irrevocably transfers, conveys, and assigns to Transferee [LaTele US] all his rights, title and interest in and to the Rights, together with all the exclusive rights granted to the owner of a copyright under Venezuelan and U.S. copyright laws." [ Id. (emphasis added)].
Also in the Second Assignment, Fraiz specifically represented and warranted that "he holds all the copyrights and rights to the scripts and audiovisual works of the originally produced soap operas and the Rights being transferred and assigned herein are his sole property and that no other party has any claim to such property." [ Id. at p. 54].
Fraiz executed the Second Assignment on his own behalf, as "Transferor," and also as President of LaTele US, as "Transferee." [ Id. at p. 58]. Both of Fraiz's signatures were separately notarized by Peggy J. Garcia, on April 18, 2012. [ Id.]. Ms. Garcia is an attorney employed by Robert Allen Law, P.A., a Miami law firm that has appeared in this case on behalf of LaTele Venezuela as its "non-litigation counsel." [ECF Nos. 44; 45]. In filing material in this case for Latele (when it appeared for a limited purpose of submitting a response to a show cause order), RAL advised (in October 2013) that it "represents Latele in its non-litigation interests." [ECF No. 44, p. 1].
Fraiz executed the Joint Consent (also on April 18, 2012), as both the Sole Director and Shareholder of LaTele US, authorizing the purchase of the rights to Maria Maria. [ECF No. 166-1, p. 52]. That same day, April 18, 2012, Fraiz emailed signed versions of the Transfer Documents to Luis Villanueva and Ivan Morales, Esq. at Somos using one of his company email addresses and accounts and he did so again on the following day, April 19, 2012, from his personal email address. [ Id. at pp. 61-70, 72-80].
In addition, on April 18, 2012, Somos provided comments on a draft License Agreement between LaTele US as "Licensor" and Televisa, S.A. de C.V. as "Licensee."
That draft agreement recites that LaTele US "solely owns and controls all rights in and to" Maria Maria[*4] and other novelas. [ECF No. 166-1, pp. 82-96]. In the draft agreement, LaTele US proposes to "grant[] to Licensee an exclusive license of the Rights in and to" Maria Maria. [ Id. at p. 83]. LaTele US represents and warrants that it: "has the sole, full right and authority to enter into this Agreement;" "has not made and will not make any grant, assignment, or agreement that will or might conflict or interfere with the rights granted to Licensee herein, provided, however, that [LaTele US] shall be free to resolve and/or settle its allegations of copyright infringement related to the Telenovela Program Maria Maria;" and "is the sole and exclusive owner of the Rights in and to" Maria Maria. [ Id. at pp. 86-87].
On April 19, 2012, Ivan Morales, General Counsel & Corporate Secretary of Somos, emailed fully executed copies of the Second Assignment and Joint Consent to two executives at Televisa. [ Id. at pp. 61-70].
These documents were at the heart of Defendants' motion to dismiss. [ECF No. 166]. Basically, Defendants argued that Latele lacks standing to bring these copyright claims because it no longer owned the copyright to Maria Maria as of the time the lawsuit was filed.
After Defendants filed their motion to dismiss, Latele produced an "Addendum," supposedly prepared two years earlier, that purports to undo or nullify the First Assignment. Latele contends that this completely undermines the now-denied standing-based dismissal motion. Defendants accuse Latele of fraudulently creating the Addendum and falsely claiming it was prepared in 2012, rather than in 2014 (in response to the Motion to Dismiss).
Fraiz admitted executing documents that transferred Maria Maria first from Latele to himself personally (the First Assignment) and then from himself to Latele US (the Second Assignment) but testified that the transfers, negotiations and related documents were never disclosed by Plaintiff in discovery because the deal was never consummated; and regardless, he claimed, Maria Maria was never an intended part of the deal. He testified that including Maria Maria in the transfers was a "mistake" he sought to correct with the Addendum. [ECF No. 324, p. 268].
The parties vigorously disagree about the bona fides of the so-called Addendum. Plaintiff contends it is legitimate while Defendants brand it as a fraudulent sham.
The dispute over the legitimacy of the Addendum, as well as disputes over the parties' intent in executing the two Assignments and the legal significance of them (especially since the proposed deal for which they were supposedly created never went through), generate a substantial, critical factual dispute over the ownership of Maria Maria.
In support of their contention that the Addendum was fabricated in response to the Motion to Dismiss, Defendants produced documentary evidence and expert testimony that the face of the Addendum indicates it was filed, and should appear, at a unique page of the records of a particular notary office. [ECF No. 325, pp. 75-85]. Nevertheless, when Defendants' expert inspected those records, a completely different document appeared. [*5] Neither party has located any notary records where the Addendum was actually recorded. Thus, Defendants assert the Addendum was not actually filed with that notary office and instead is an after-the-fact creation.
However, as referenced above, the Addendum itself and Mr. Fraiz's testimony support Plaintiff's position that it was created in 2012.
In addition, Plaintiff submitted the declaration (made under penalty of perjury) of Paola Alexandra Munive Castillo, a Venezuelan attorney. [ECF No. 331-2]. In this affidavit, Ms. Munive explained that she prepared, drafted and reviewed the Addendum in 2012, at the request of Xiomara Ruiz, an agent of Mr. Fraiz's. [ Id.]. Ms. Ruiz also submitted a declaration. [ECF No. 331-1].
Although Ms. Munive's declaration explains that she was involved with the Addendum in 2012, Defendants emphasize that there are several suspicious aspects to her declaration. For example, no metadata or drafts were produced. Ms. Munive, however, proffered an explanation: she said she no longer has the electronic file of the Addendum she drafted in 2012 because she prepared it on a computer she no longer possesses. [ECF No. 331-2, p. 2]. Ms. Munive's declaration did not say anything about the server, but Ms. Ruiz's declaration said she asked Ms. Munive to conduct a search for ESI and metadata on her computer and server but that the search yielded no results. [ECF No. 331-1, p. 1].
Defendants view the absence of metadata/ESI and drafts as evidence further establishing that the Addendum "was in fact fabricated [in 2014] as part of Plaintiff's effort to manufacture standing and explain away its failure to disclose the Transfer Documents and the transactions reflected therein." [ECF 359-1, p. 12].
Given the significance of the Addendum and the diametrically opposed positions on its validity, the Undersigned recently permitted Defendants to take discovery concerning, among other topics, the Transfer Documents described above, the Addendum, the lack of ESI/metadata, and the circumstances surrounding the purported witnessing and filing of the Addendum in Venezuela.
In a November 10, 2014 Order [ECF No. 368], the Undersigned gave Defendants until February 10, 2015 to take that additional discovery. The parties have not advised the Court about the information obtained in discovery or its impact on the critical factual dispute outlined above.
II. Legal Analysis
Summary judgment is appropriate only when the Court is satisfied that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a) . An issue is "genuine" if there is sufficient evidence such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for either party. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242 , 248 , 106 S. Ct. 2505 , 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). A fact is "material" if it may affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law. See id. As the movant, Latele bears the initial burden of showing, by reference to materials on file, that there are no genuine issues of material fact that should be decided at trial. See id.
When the moving party has the burden of proof at trial (and Latele [*6] would have the burden to prove ownership of the Maria Maria copyright), that party must "show affirmatively the absence of a genuine issue of material fact: it must support its motion with credible evidence that would entitle it to a directed verdict if not controverted at trial." Rich v. Sec'y, Fla. Dep't of Corr., 716 F.3d 525 , 530 (11th Cir. 2013) (reversing summary judgment) (emphasis in original).
As succinctly explained by the Eleventh Circuit, "by definition, a summary judgment ruling involves no findings of fact." Id.
Defendants can withstand summary judgment by establishing that, "based on the evidence in the record, there can be more than one reasonable conclusion as to the proper verdict." Burton v. Belle Glade, 178 F.3d 1175 , 1187 (11th Cir. 1999) (internal citation omitted). The Court must afford Defendants all justifiable inferences from the evidence in the record, and reasonable doubts must be resolved in Defendants' favor. See id. "If the record presents factual issues, the court must not decide them; it must deny the motion and proceed to trial." Id. (quoting Clemons v. Dougherty Cnty., 684 F.2d 1365 , 1368-69 (11th Cir. 1982)). "If reasonable minds might differ on the inferences arising from undisputed facts, then the court should deny summary judgment." See id. (quoting Clemons, 684 F.2d at 1368-69 ).
An issue of fact is "material," for purposes of motion for summary judgment, if it is a legal element of the claim, as identified by substantive law governing the case, such that its presence or absence might affect the outcome of the action. Tipton v. Bergrohr GMBH-Siegen, 965 F.2d 994 , reh'g en banc denied, 974 F.2d 173 (11th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 911 , 113 S. Ct. 1259 , 122 L. Ed. 2d 657 (1993); see also Butchkosky v. Enstrom Helicopter Corp., 855 F. Supp. 1251 (S.D. Fla. 1993), aff'd without opinion, 66 F.3d 341 (11th Cir. 1995) (in summary judgment proceedings, "material fact" is one which is "determinative of parties' duties or rights.").
A dispute is "genuine," for purposes of a motion for summary judgment, where there is evidence which would support the return of a verdict at trial by a reasonable jury in favor of the non-moving party. Harmony Homes, Inc., v. U.S. on Behalf of Small Bus. Admin., 936 F. Supp. 907 (M.D. Fla. 1996), aff'd, 124 F.3d 1299 (11th Cir. 1997). Summary judgment may not be granted where the record reflects conflicting versions of material facts which require credibility determinations. Hilburn v. Murata Elecs. N. Am., Inc., 181 F.3d 1220 , 1225 (11th Cir. 1999); Van Poyck v. Dugger, 779 F. Supp. 571 (M.D. Fla. 1991). See also Slusser v. Orange Cnty. Pub. Schs., 936 F. Supp. 895 (M.D. Fla. 1996) (in summary judgment proceedings, court may not weigh credibility of the parties, and if determination of case rests on which competing version of the facts or events is true, case should be presented to trier of fact.)
The factual dispute outlined above is only one of several alleged disputes which Defendants argue in opposition to the partial summary judgment motion. But, given the overarching importance of the dispute in relation to the critical point at issue in the motion (ownership of Maria Maria), a lack of certainty over the bona fides of the Addendum is more than sufficient [*7] to justify denial of the motion.
There is a plethora of genuine factual disputes swirling around the Addendum and Latele's claim to still be the owner of Maria Maria: issues of credibility, issues arising from evidence of possible spoliation, issues flowing from non-frivolous allegations of post-dating the Addendum, issues generated by inconsistencies in testimony, and issues triggered by the untimely production of the Addendum (and how they relate to the legitimacy of the document and when it was actually created). Under these circumstances, the Court must deny Latele's motion for partial summary judgment. Gary Friedrich Enters., LLC v. Marvel Characters, Inc., 716 F.3d 302 (2d Cir. 2013) (vacating summary judgment in copyright infringement case because, among other reasons, there existed a factual issue as to whether a freelance author had assigned his renewal rights to a publisher). See generally McAirlaids, Inc. v. Kimberly-Clark Corp., 756 F.3d 307 (4th Cir. 2014) (reversing summary judgment in Lanham Act lawsuit for trade-dress infringement and unfair competition because of factual issue); Dorpan, S.L. v. Hotel Melia, Inc., 728 F.3d 55 (1st Cir. 2013) (genuine issue of material fact existed in copyright case, leading to summary judgment reversal); 1-800 Contacts, Inc. v. Lens.com, Inc., 722 F.3d 1229 (10th Cir. 2013) (reversing summary judgment in trademark infringement action because of material fact issues).
III. Conclusion
The Undersigned denies Latele's partial summary judgment motion concerning ownership of Maria Maria.

VII. 
COMPENSATION OF RECEIVER 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Receiver and all personnel hired by the Receiver, including counsel to the Receiver and accountants, are entitled to reasonable compensation for the performance of duties pursuant to this Order and for the cost of actual out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them, from the assets now held by, in the possession or control of, or which may be received by, the Vast Defendants.

VIII.
RECEIVER'S FINAL REPORT AND DISBURSEMENT OF ASSETS OF THE VAST DEFENDANTS 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that:
A. The Receiver shall liquidate the assets of the Vast Defendants, other than the ESI, as soon as practicable.

The Final Report on the Vast Defendants shall include an accounting of the Vast Defendants Receivership Estate's finances and total assets and a description of what other actions, if any, must be taken to wind-down the Receivership. The Receiver shall mail copies of the Final Report on the Vast Defendants to all known creditors of the Vast Defendants with a notice stating that any objections to paying any assets of the Vast Defendants to satisfy the Receiver's costs and expenses and the monetary judgment set forth in this Order must be submitted to the Court and served by mail upon the Receiver and the parties within thirty (30) days of the mailing of the final Report on the Vast Defendants. If subsequent actions (such as the completion of tax returns [*6] or further actions to recover funds for the Vast Defendants Receivership Estate) are appropriate, the Receiver shall file an additional report or reports ("Supplemental Report") describing the subsequent actions and a subsequent application for the payment of fees and expenses related to the subsequent acts.
B. The Court will review the Final Report on the Vast Defendants and any objections to the Final Report on the Vast Defendants and, absent a valid objection, will issue an order directing the Receiver to: (1) pay the reasonable costs and expenses of administering the Vast Defendants Receivership Estate, including the compensation of the Receiver and the Receiver's personnel authorized by Section VII (Compensation of Receiver) of this Order or other orders of this Court, and the actual out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Receiver in carrying-out his duties; and (2) pay all remaining funds to the Plaintiffs as partial satisfaction of the judgment.
C. With Court approval, the Receiver may hold back funds for a specified period as a reserve to cover additional fees and costs related to actions to be addressed in a Supplemental Report. If the Receiver does not make a supplemental application for fees and expenses within the specified period, or if funds remain in the reserve fund after the payments of fees and expenses approved by the Court in response to such a supplemental application, all funds remaining in the reserve fund shall be immediately paid to the Plaintiffs or their designated agent.
D. Upon Court approval of the Final Report, the Clerk of the Court is directed to return the Receiver's bond in the amount of $25,000 filed in this action as a requisite pursuant to the Temporary Restraining Order [DE 13].
IX. 
TERMINATION OF THE RECEIVERSHIP 
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Receiver must complete all duties, except the storing of ESI, within 120 days after entry of this Order, but any party or the Receiver may request that the Court extend the Receiver's term for good cause.

(p) Free-to-pay conversion means, in an offer or agreement to sell or provide any goods or services, a provision under which a customer receives a product or service for free for an initial period and will incur an obligation to pay for the product or service if he or she does not take affirmative action to cancel before the end of that period.

§ 310.3 Deceptive telemarketing acts or practices. 
(a) Prohibited deceptive telemarketing acts or practices. It is a deceptive telemarketing act or practice and a violation of this Rule for any seller or telemarketer to engage in the following conduct:
(1) Before a customer consents to pay659 for goods or services offered, failing to disclose truthfully, in a clear and conspicuous manner, the following [*12] material information:
(i) The total costs to purchase, receive, or use, and the quantity of, any goods or services that are the subject of the sales offer;660

(iv) In any prize promotion, the odds of being able to receive the prize, and, if the odds are not calculable in advance, the factors used in calculating the odds; that no purchase or payment is required to win a prize or to participate in a prize promotion and that any purchase or payment will not increase the person's chances of winning; and the no-purchase/no-payment method of participating in the prize promotion with either instructions on how to participate or an address or local or toll-free telephone number to which customers may write or call for information on how to participate;

(vii) If the offer includes a negative option feature, all material terms and conditions of the negative option feature, including, but not limited to, the fact that the customer's account will be charged unless the customer takes an affirmative action to avoid the charge(s), the date(s) the charge(s) will be submitted for payment, and the specific steps the customer must take to avoid the charge(s); and
(viii) In the sale of any debt relief service:
(A) the amount of time necessary to achieve the represented results, and to the extent that the service may include a settlement offer to any of the customer's creditors or debt collectors, the time by which the debt relief service provider will make a bona fide settlement offer to each of them;

(C) to the extent that any aspect of the debt relief service relies upon or results in the customer's failure to make timely payments to creditors or debt collectors, that the use of the debt relief service will likely adversely affect the customer's creditworthiness, may result in the customer being subject to collections or sued by creditors or debt collectors, and may increase the amount of money the customer [*13] owes due to the accrual of fees and interest; and
(D) to the extent that the debt relief service requests or requires the customer to place funds in an account at an insured financial institution, that the customer owns the funds held in the account, the customer may withdraw from the debt relief service at any time without penalty, and, if the customer withdraws, the customer must receive all funds in the account, other than funds earned by the debt relief service in compliance with § 310.4(a)(5)(i)(A) through (C).

(x) Any material aspect of any debt relief service, including, but not limited to, the amount of money or the percentage of the debt amount that a customer may save by using such service; the amount of time necessary to achieve the represented results; the amount of money or the percentage of each outstanding debt that the customer must accumulate before the provider of the debt relief service will initiate attempts with the customer's creditors or debt collectors or make a bona fide offer to negotiate, settle, or modify the terms of the customer's debt; the effect of the service on a customer's creditworthiness; the effect of the service on collection efforts of the customer's creditors or debt collectors; the percentage or number of customers who attain the represented results; and whether a debt relief service is offered or provided by a non-profit entity.
(3) Causing billing information to be submitted for payment, or collecting or attempting to collect payment [*14] for goods or services or a charitable contribution, directly or indirectly, without the customer's or donor's express verifiable authorization, except when the method of payment used is a credit card subject to protections of the Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z,661 or a debit card subject to the protections of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E.662 Such authorization shall be deemed verifiable if any of the following means is employed:

(4) Making a false or misleading statement to induce any person to pay for goods or services or to induce a charitable contribution.
(b) Assisting and facilitating. It is a deceptive telemarketing act or practice and a violation of this Rule for a person to provide substantial assistance or support to any seller or telemarketer when that person knows or consciously avoids knowing that the seller or telemarketer is engaged in any act or practice that violates §§ 310.3(a), (c) or (d), or § 310.4 of this Rule.
(c) Credit card laundering. Except as expressly permitted by the applicable credit card system, it is a deceptive [*15] telemarketing act or practice and a violation of this Rule for:

(2) Any person to employ, solicit, or otherwise cause a merchant, or an employee, representative, or agent of the merchant, to present to or deposit into the credit card system for payment, a credit card sales draft generated by a telemarketing transaction that is not the result of a telemarketing credit card transaction between the cardholder and the merchant; or

(d) Prohibited deceptive acts or practices in the solicitation of charitable contributions.

(6) A charitable organization's or telemarketer's affiliation with, or endorsement or sponsorship by, any person or government entity.
§ 310.4 Abusive telemarketing acts or practices.
(a) Abusive conduct generally. It is an abusive telemarketing act or practice and a violation of this Rule for any seller or telemarketer to engage in the following conduct:
(1) Threats, intimidation, or the use of profane or obscene language;
(2) Requesting or receiving payment of any fee or consideration for goods or services represented to remove derogatory information from, or improve, a person's credit history, credit record, or credit rating until:
(i) The time frame in which the seller has represented all of the goods or services will be provided to that person has expired; and
(ii) The seller has provided the person with documentation in the form of a consumer report from a consumer reporting agency demonstrating that the promised results have been achieved, such report having been issued more than six months after the results were achieved. Nothing in this Rule should be construed to affect the requirement [*16] in the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. 1681 , that a consumer report may only be obtained for a specified permissible purpose;
(3) Requesting or receiving payment of any fee or consideration from a person for goods or services represented to recover or otherwise assist in the return of money or any other item of value paid for by, or promised to, that person in a previous telemarketing transaction, until seven (7) business days after such money or other item is delivered to that person. This provision shall not apply to goods or services provided to a person by a licensed attorney;
(4) Requesting or receiving payment of any fee or consideration in advance of obtaining a loan or other extension of credit when the seller or telemarketer has guaranteed or represented a high likelihood of success in obtaining or arranging a loan or other extension of credit for a person;
(5)(i) Requesting or receiving payment of any fee or consideration for any debt relief service until and unless:
(A) The seller or telemarketer has renegotiated, settled, reduced, or otherwise altered the terms of at least one debt pursuant to a settlement agreement, debt management plan, or other such valid contractual agreement executed by the customer;
(B) The customer has made at least one payment pursuant to that settlement agreement, debt management plan, or other valid contractual agreement between the customer and the creditor or debt collector; and
(C) To the extent that debts enrolled in a service are renegotiated, settled, reduced, or otherwise altered individually, the fee or consideration either:
(1) Bears the same proportional relationship to the total fee for renegotiating, settling, reducing, or altering the terms of the entire debt balance as the individual debt amount bears to the entire debt amount. The individual debt amount and the entire debt amount are those owed at the time the debt was enrolled in the service; or
(2) Is a percentage of the amount saved as a result of the renegotiation, settlement, reduction, or alteration. The percentage charged cannot change from one individual debt to another. The amount saved is the difference between the amount owed at the time the debt was enrolled in the service and the amount actually paid to satisfy the debt.
(ii) Nothing in § 310.4(a)(5)(i) prohibits requesting or requiring the customer to place funds in an account to be used for the debt relief provider's fees and for payments to creditors or debt collectors in connection with the renegotiation, settlement, reduction, or other alteration of the terms of payment or other terms of a debt, provided that:
(A) The funds are held in an account at an insured financial institution;
(B) The customer owns the funds held in the account and is paid accrued interest on the account, if any;
(C) The entity administering the account is not owned or controlled by, or in any way affiliated with, the debt relief service;
(D) The entity administering the account does not give or accept any money or other compensation in exchange for referrals of business involving the debt relief service; and[*17] 
(E) The customer may withdraw from the debt relief service at any time without penalty, and must receive all funds in the account, other than funds earned by the debt relief service in compliance with § 310.4(a)(5)(i)(A) through (C), within seven (7) business days of the customer's request.
(6) Disclosing or receiving, for consideration, unencrypted consumer account numbers for use in telemarketing; provided, however, that this paragraph shall not apply to the disclosure or receipt of a customer's or donor's billing information to process a payment for goods or services or a charitable contribution pursuant to a transaction;
(7) Causing billing information to be submitted for payment, directly or indirectly, without the express informed consent of the customer or donor. In any telemarketing transaction, the seller or telemarketer must obtain the express informed consent of the customer or donor to be charged for the goods or services or charitable contribution and to be charged using the identified account. In any telemarketing transaction involving preacquired account information, the requirements in paragraphs (a)(7)(i) through (ii) of this section must be met to evidence express informed consent.
(i) In any telemarketing transaction involving preacquired account information and a free-to-pay conversion feature, the seller or telemarketer must:
(A) Obtain from the customer, at a minimum, the last four (4) digits of the account number to be charged;
(B) Obtain from the customer his or her express agreement to be charged for the goods or services and to be charged using the account number pursuant to paragraph (a)(7)(i)(A) of this section; and,
(C) Make and maintain an audio recording of the entire telemarketing transaction.
(ii) In any other telemarketing transaction involving preacquired account information not described in paragraph (a)(7)(i) of this section, the seller or telemarketer must:
(A) At a minimum, identify the account to be charged with sufficient specificity for the customer or donor to understand what account will be charged; and
(B) Obtain from the customer or donor his or her express agreement to be charged for the goods or services and to be charged using the account number identified pursuant to paragraph (a)(7)(ii)(A) of this section; or
(8) Failing to transmit or cause to be transmitted the telephone number, and, when made available by the telemarketer's carrier, the name of the telemarketer, to any caller identification service in use by a recipient of a telemarketing call; provided that it shall not be a violation to substitute (for the name and phone number used in, or billed for, making the call) the name of the seller or charitable organization on behalf of which a telemarketing call is placed, and the seller's or charitable organization's customer or donor service telephone number, which is answered during regular business hours.
(b) Pattern of calls. (1) It is an abusive telemarketing act or practice and a violation of this Rule for a telemarketer to engage in, or for a seller to cause a telemarketer to engage in, the following conduct:[*18] 
(i) Causing any telephone to ring, or engaging any person in telephone conversation, repeatedly or continuously with intent to annoy, abuse, or harass any person at the called number;
(ii) Denying or interfering in any way, directly or indirectly, with a person's right to be placed on any registry of names and/or telephone numbers of persons who do not wish to receive outbound telephone calls established to comply with § 310.4(b)(1)(iii);
(iii) Initiating any outbound telephone call to a person when:
(A) That person previously has stated that he or she does not wish to receive an outbound telephone call made by or on behalf of the seller whose goods or services are being offered or made on behalf of the charitable organization for which a charitable contribution is being solicited; or
(B) That person's telephone number is on the "do-not-call" registry, maintained by the Commission, of persons who do not wish to receive outbound telephone calls to induce the purchase of goods or services unless the seller:
(i) Has obtained the express agreement, in writing, of such person to place calls to that person. Such written agreement shall clearly evidence such person's authorization that calls made by or on behalf of a specific party may be placed to that person, and shall include the telephone number to which the calls may be placed and the signature664 of that person; or
(ii) Has an established business relationship with such person, and that person has not stated that he or she does not wish to receive outbound telephone calls under paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(A) of this section; or
(iv) Abandoning any outbound telephone call. An outbound telephone call is "abandoned" under this section if a person answers it and the telemarketer does not connect the call to a sales representative within two (2) seconds of the person's completed greeting.
(v) Initiating any outbound telephone call that delivers a prerecorded message, other than a prerecorded message permitted for compliance with the call abandonment safe harbor in § 310.4(b)(4)(iii), unless:
(A) In any such call to induce the purchase of any good or service, the seller has obtained from the recipient of the call an express agreement, in writing, that:
(i) The seller obtained only after a clear and conspicuous disclosure that the purpose of the agreement is to authorize the seller to place prerecorded calls to such person;
(ii) The seller obtained without requiring, directly or indirectly, that the agreement be executed as a condition of purchasing any good or service;
(iii) Evidences the willingness of the recipient of the call to receive calls that deliver prerecorded messages by or on behalf of a specific seller; and
(iv) Includes such person's telephone number and signature;665 and
(B) In any such call to induce the purchase of any good or service, or to induce a charitable contribution from a member of, or previous donor to, a nonprofit charitable organization on whose behalf the call is made, the seller or telemarketer:

If requested by that person, the telemarketer must disclose the no-purchase/no-payment entry method for the prize promotion; provided, however, that, in any internal upsell for the sale of goods or services, the seller or telemarketer must provide the disclosures listed in this section only to the extent that the information in the upsell differs from the disclosures provided in the initial telemarketing transaction.
(e) Required oral disclosures in charitable solicitations. It is an abusive telemarketing [*21] act or practice and a violation of this Rule for a telemarketer, in an outbound telephone call to induce a charitable contribution, to fail to disclose truthfully, promptly, and in a clear and conspicuous manner to the person receiving the call, the following information:
(1) The identity of the charitable organization on behalf of which the request is being made; and
(2) That the purpose of the call is to solicit a charitable contribution.

(c) The seller and the telemarketer calling on behalf of the seller may, by written agreement, allocate responsibility between themselves for the recordkeeping required by this Section. When a seller and telemarketer have entered into such an agreement, the terms of that agreement shall govern, and the seller or telemarketer, as the case may be. need not keep records that duplicate those of the other.

(b) It is a violation of this Rule for any telemarketer, on behalf of any seller, to initiate an outbound telephone call to any person whose telephone number is within a given area code unless that seller, either directly or through another person, first has paid the annual fee, required by § 310.8(c), for access to the telephone numbers within that area code that are included in the National Do Not Call Registry; provided, however, that such payment is not necessary if the seller initiates, or causes a telemarketer to initiate, calls solely to persons pursuant to §§ 310.4(b)(1)(iii)(B)(i) or (ii), and the seller does not access the National Do Not Call Registry for any other purpose.
(c) The annual fee, which must be paid by any person prior to obtaining access to the National Do Not Call Registry, is $59 for each area code of data accessed, up to a maximum of $16,228; provided, however, that there shall be no charge to any person for accessing [*24] the first five area codes of data, and provided further, that there shall be no charge to any person engaging in or causing others to engage in outbound telephone calls to consumers and who is accessing area codes of data in the National Do Not Call Registry if the person is permitted to access, but is not required to access, the National Do Not Call Registry under this Rule, 47 CFR 64.1200 , or any other Federal regulation or law. Any person accessing the National Do Not Call Registry may not participate in any arrangement to share the cost of accessing the registry, including any arrangement with any telemarketer or service provider to divide the costs to access the registry among various clients of that telemarketer or service provider.

To obtain access to additional area codes of data during the first six months of the annual period, each person required to pay the fee under § 310.8(c) must first pay $59 for each additional area code of data not initially selected. To obtain access to additional area codes of data during the second six months of the annual period, each person required to pay the fee under § 310.8(c) must first pay $30 for each additional area code of data not initially selected.

BARRY S. SELTZER 
CLASS ACTION
ORDER ON PLAINTIFFS' MOTION TO COMPEL [DE 45]
THIS CAUSE is before the Court upon Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel Defendant R.T.G. Furniture Corp. ("RTG") to Produce Documents and Respond to Interrogatories, and Comply with ESI Protocol [DE 45]. Plaintiffs ask the Court to overrule certain objections to interrogatories and requests for production raised by R.T.G.1 
This is a class action alleging violations of Florida's Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act, Fla. Stat. § 501.201-.213 , and unjust enrichment. Plaintiffs allege that RTG made material misrepresentations or omissions when selling upholstery protection plans ("FFPP") to customers and, in some cases, failed to apply the upholstery protection product that consumers purchased. In large part, the discovery matters in dispute arise from this case's status as a class action. Plaintiffs seek discovery related to Defendant's affiliates that do business online and in other states, which Defendant argues are not related to the claims brought against it. Plaintiffs also seek discovery of the names and contact information of RTG's customers who purchased FFPP, which RTG argues are not relevant to the case at this stage of pre-class certification. Finally, Plaintiffs seek information regarding sales quotas and incentives offered to RTG's sales force for selling FFPP, which information RTG contends is not relevant to whether misrepresentations were made, or whether RTG failed to apply the FFPP product when purchased. In addition to arguing lack of relevancy, RTG contends that the disputed discovery requests are not proportional to the needs of the case.
Rule 26(b), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure , permits discovery
regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party's claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case, considering the importance of the issues at stake in the action, the amount in controversy, the parties' relative access to relevant information, the parties' resources, the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues, and whether the burden or [*2] expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit. Information within this scope of discovery need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1) . "Relevancy is determined based on the 'tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence, and the fact is of consequence in determining the action.' Fed. R. Evid. 401 ." Garcia v. Padilla, No. 2:15 CV 735 FTM 29CM, [2016 BL 70399], 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29398 , 2016 WL 881143 , at *2 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 8, 2016). The Court has considered the Rule 26(b)(1) factors with respect to each of the discovery requests at issue.

Discovery Related to Online and Out-of-States Affiliates 
RTG has objected to responding to discovery requests directed at online and out-ofstate affiliates. RTG is a Florida corporation that does not own any subsidiaries or affiliates with stores outside of Florida or that sell any products outside of Florida. [DE 50-3]. Likewise, RTG does not operate a website and does not sell any products online.2 [DE 50-3]. Thus, RTG contends that, to the extent Plaintiffs' discovery requests are directed at online and out-of-state affiliates, the discovery is neither relevant nor proportional to the needs of this case.
Plaintiffs argue that all of the RTG entities "appear to have a common parent located in Seffner, Florida" and that they have served RTG with interrogatories seeking to clarify the RTG corporate structure. Plaintiffs point to evidence that the online affiliate shares a customer service number with RTG and that invoices to different out-of-state affiliates are sent to a "Cost Center" located in Seffner, Florida, at the same address as the Defendant. Thus, Plaintiffs claim, evidence of sales and application practices from non-Florida affiliates would be relevant to whether class certification is appropriate.
The Court disagrees. At this stage of the proceedings, the three named Plaintiffs are Florida residents who purchased upholstery protection from a Florida corporation. Only the Florida corporation is named as a defendant. The cause of action is based upon Florida law. Nothing in the current posture of this action makes discovery from the out-of-state or online affiliates relevant to this case; furthermore, the information sought from the affiliates is not proportional to the needs of this Florida action. Plaintiffs' request to compel discovery from online and out-of-state affiliates is denied and RTG's General Objections Nos. 7 and 8, and Definitional Objection No. 5 are sustained.
Discovery of Customer Names and Contact Information 
Plaintiffs' interrogatory number 2 asks for a list of customers (name and contact information) who purchased the FFPP upholstery protection plan from RTG. Plaintiffs allege that they have requested the customer lists to establish numerosity and ascertainability of the class, as well as to identify potential witnesses.
RTG objects on the grounds that the interrogatory is overly broad, unduly burdensome, and lacks relevancy and proportionality to the case. RTG further states that "[c]ustomer names and contact information have no bearing on the merits of Plaintiffs' [*3] individual claims or on the question of class certification. The request seeks confidential personal information regarding RTGs' customers that would be relevant, if at all, only if and after a class is certified."
RTG fears that Plaintiffs' counsel will use the customer contact information to solicit potential plaintiffs, rather than for any proper purpose. Discovery of class members' identities prior to class certification is not favored where plaintiffs' attorneys may be seeking the information to solicit new clients, rather than to establish the propriety of certification. Levine v. Gunther Motor Co. of Plantation, Inc., No. 10-61812-CIV, [2010 BL 294510], 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 136230 , 2010 WL 5140590 (S.D. Fla. Dec. 9, 2010); Dziennik v. Sealift, Inc. No. 05-cv-4659, [2006 BL 62494], 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 33011 , 2006 WL 1455464 , at *1-2 (E.D.N.Y. May 23, 2006). RTG cites to the three Plaintiffs' testimony that they became involved in the litigation after learning about the allegations in the Complaint from persons associated with Plaintiffs' counsel's law firm. Plaintiffs deny seeking a customer list so as to find prospective class representatives.
RTG also argues that customers' names and contact information are unnecessary to establish class certification. Evidence regarding numerosity can be shown through the data regarding total sales of fabric and leather protection that has already been produced by RTG. Likewise, RTG has stipulated that it maintains information that identifies customers who have purchased the upholstery protection plans, so ascertainability is established.
Although Plaintiffs must establish numerosity and ascertainability of the class for it to be certified, the Court finds that the names and contact information of RTG's customers are not relevant or proportional to the needs of the case. RTG has provided sales information and totals, which would be used to establish numerosity, and it has stipulated that it maintains records of its customers, so that class members can be ascertained. Plaintiffs have not articulated a legitimate need for customer identities at this stage of the litigation; indeed, the names and addresses of the customers would add nothing to the argument for class certification. Therefore, RTG's objection to interrogatory number 2 is sustained, and Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel an answer to interrogatory number 2 is denied.
Discovery of Information Regarding Salespersons, Sales Competition and Sales Quotas 
RTG objected to three interrogatories and six requests to produce seeking information about individual salespersons' sales of the upholstery protection products, as well as quotas, incentives, bonuses, and competitions run by RTG to promote FFPP sales. Plaintiffs contend this information is necessary to establish that RTG employees engaged in deceptive acts or practices. Plaintiffs also argue that RTG's high sales quotas for upholstery protection would establish that the resulting sales exceeded the factory's ability to apply the protection. RTG disputes these contentions. Additionally, RTG argues that it has agreed to provide Plaintiffs with the materials used [*4] to train its sales people about the upholstery protection program and, therefore, information about quotas and incentives to sell have no bearing on the issue of whether RTG's salespeople were encouraged to make misrepresentations.
The Court finds that sales information, counseling, and tracking of individual sales people are not relevant or proportional to the case. However, RTG's sales quotas, incentives, and competitions, related specifically to the FFPP upholstery protection plan, have some nexus to and bearing on the claims in this case. Indeed, as Rule 26(b) observes, "discovery need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable." Accordingly, Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel will be granted as to Interrogatory Numbers 10 and 11, and Request to Produce Number 25. The Motion to Compel is denied as to Interrogatory Number 8, and Request to Produce Numbers 4, 7, and 27.
Documents Related to "Slamming" 
Plaintiffs request all documents related to "slamming," which is defined as adding the FFPP upholstery protection plans to customer's purchases without their knowledge. RTG objects to this request because Plaintiffs' Complaint alleges the opposite of slammming; that is, RTG sales people made material misrepresentations and omissions in selling the FFPP package.
The Court agrees that this case is not about "slamming" and, therefore, the documents related to "slamming" are neither relevant nor proportional to the case. Plaintiff's Motion to Compel a response to Request to Produce Number 28 is denied. RTG's objection to Request to Produce Number 28 is sustained.
In light of the foregoing, it is hereby
ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel [DE 45] is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. The Motion is granted as to interrogatory numbers 10 and 11 and Request to Produce number 25. RTG shall serve its responses within ten (10) days of the date of this Order. The Motion is denied as to all other interrogatories and requests to produce.
DONE AND ORDERED in Chambers, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, this 28th day of March, 2016.

Plaintiffs also request an order requiring RTG "to provide search terms in order to locate electronically stored information ("ESI") consistent with the ESI protocol" stipulated by the parties [DE 41], but that request is moot as the parties report they have reached an agreement on that issue.

ELIZABETH M. TIMOTHY, UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE.

ELIZABETH M. TIMOTHY 
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
This case has been referred to the undersigned magistrate judge pursuant to the authority of 28 U.S.C. § 636(b) and Local Rules 72.1(A) , 72.2(D) and 72.3 of this court relating to review of administrative determinations under the Social Security Act ("Act") and related statutes, 42 U.S.C. § 401 , et seq. It is now before the court pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 405(g) of the Act for review of a final determination of the Commissioner of Social Security ("Commissioner") denying Plaintiff's application for disability insurance benefits ("DIB") under Title II of the Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 401-34 , and for Supplemental Security Income ("SSI") benefits under Title XVI of the Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1381-83 .
Upon review of the record before this court, it is the opinion of the undersigned that the findings of fact and determinations of the Commissioner are supported by substantial evidence; thus, the decision of the Commissioner should be affirmed.
I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY
On January 13, 2009, Plaintiff filed applications for DIB and SSI, and in both applications she alleged disability beginning July 6, 2006 (tr. 11).1 Her applications were denied initially and on reconsideration, and thereafter Plaintiff requested a hearing before an administrative law judge ("ALJ"). A hearing was held on February 7, 2011, and on February 17, 2011, the ALJ issued a decision in which he found Plaintiff "not disabled," as defined under the Act, at any time through the date of his decision (tr. 11-18). On August 23, 2012, the Appeals Council denied Plaintiff's request for review (tr. 1-3). Thus, the decision of the ALJ stands as the final decision of the Commissioner, subject to review in this court. Ingram v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec. Admin., 496 F.3d 1253 , 1262 (11th Cir. 2007). This appeal followed.
II. FINDINGS OF THE ALJ
In his written decision dated February 17, 2011, the ALJ made several findings relative to the issues raised in this appeal (see tr. 11-18):
1) Plaintiff meets the insured status requirements of the Act through June 30, 2012.2 
2) Plaintiff has not engaged in substantial gainful activity since July 6, 2006, the date she alleges she became disabled.
3) Plaintiff has the following severe impairment: lower back pain secondary to degenerative disc disease ("DDD").
4) Plaintiff has no impairment or combination thereof that meets or medically equals an impairment listed in 20 C.F.R. Part 404 , Subpart P, Appendix 1 .
5) Plaintiff has the residual functional capacity ("RFC") to perform a full range of light work as defined in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1567(b) and 416.967(b) .3 
6) Plaintiff is capable of performing her past relevant work as a housekeeper, pharmacy technician, and janitor, [*2] because this work does not require the performance of work-related activities precluded by her RFC.
7) Because Plaintiff can perform her past relevant work, she was not under a disability, as defined in the Act, between July 6, 2006, and February 17, 2011.

III. STANDARD OF REVIEW
Review of the Commissioner's final decision is limited to determining whether the decision is supported by substantial evidence from the record and was a result of the application of proper legal standards. Carnes v. Sullivan, 936 F.2d 1215 , 1218 (11th Cir. 1991) ("[T]his Court may reverse the decision of the [Commissioner] only when convinced that it is not supported by substantial evidence or that proper legal standards were not applied."); see also Lewis v. Callahan, 125 F.3d 1436 , 1439 (11th Cir. 1997); Walker v. Bowen, 826 F.2d 996 , 999 (11th Cir. 1987). "A determination that is supported by substantial evidence may be meaningless . . . if it is coupled with or derived from faulty legal principles." Boyd v. Heckler, 704 F.2d 1207 , 1209 (11th Cir. 1983), superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in Elam v. R.R. Ret. Bd., 921 F.2d 1210 , 1214 (11th Cir. 1991). As long as proper legal standards were applied, the Commissioner's decision will not be disturbed if in light of the record as a whole the decision appears to be supported by substantial evidence. 42 U.S.C. § 405(g) ; Falge, 150 F.3d at 1322 ; Lewis, 125 F.3d at 1439 ; Foote v. Chater, 67 F.3d 1553 , 1560 (11th Cir. 1995). Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but not a preponderance; it is "such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion." Richardson v. Perales, 402 U.S. 389 , 401 , 91 S. Ct. 1420 , 1427 , 28 L. Ed. 2d 842 (1971) (quoting Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, 305 U.S. 197 , 59 S. Ct. 206 , 217 , 83 L. Ed. 126 (1938)); Lewis, 125 F.3d at 1439 . The court may not decide the facts anew, reweigh the evidence, or substitute its judgment for that of the Commissioner. Martin v. Sullivan, 894 F.2d 1520 , 1529 (11th Cir. 1990) (citations omitted). Even if the evidence preponderates against the Commissioner's decision, the decision must be affirmed if supported by substantial evidence. Sewell v. Bowen, 792 F.2d 1065 , 1067 (11th Cir. 1986).
The Act defines a disability as an "inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months." 42 U.S.C. § 423(d)(1)(A) . To qualify as a disability the physical or mental impairment must be so severe that the claimant is not only unable to do her previous work, "but cannot, considering [her] age, education, and work experience, engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy."  Id.§ 423(d)(2)(A) .
Pursuant to 20 C.F.R. § 404.1520(a)-(g) ,4 the Commissioner analyzes a disability claim in five steps:
1. If the claimant is performing substantial gainful activity, she is not disabled.
2. If the claimant is not performing substantial gainful activity, her impairments must be severe before she can be found disabled.
3. If the claimant is not performing substantial gainful activity and she has severe impairments that have lasted or are expected to last for a continuous period of at least twelve months, and if her impairments meet or medically equal the criteria of any impairment listed in 20 C.F.R. Part 404 , Subpart P, Appendix 1 , the claimant is presumed [*3] disabled without further inquiry.
4. If the claimant's impairments do not prevent her from doing her past relevant work, she is not disabled.
5. Even if the claimant's impairments prevent her from performing her past relevant work, if other work exists in significant numbers in the national economy that accommodates her RFC and vocational factors, she is not disabled.
The claimant bears the burden of establishing a severe impairment that keeps her from performing her past work. 20 C.F.R. § 404.1512 . If the claimant establishes such an impairment, the burden shifts to the Commissioner at step five to show the existence of other jobs in the national economy which, given the claimant's impairments, the claimant can perform. MacGregor v. Bowen, 786 F.2d 1050 , 1052 (11th Cir. 1986). If the Commissioner carries this burden, the claimant must then prove she cannot perform the work suggested by the Commissioner. Hale v. Bowen, 831 F.2d 1007 , 1011 (11th Cir. 1987).
IV. PLAINTIFF'S PERSONAL, EMPLOYMENT AND MEDICAL HISTORY
A. Personal History
Plaintiff was born in 1963, and was forty-seven years of age on the day the ALJ issued his decision (tr. 8, 120). She completed high school, was single at the time of her hearing, and has six children with whom she lives or has lived (see tr. 415 (Plaintiff's report in January 2009 that she lives with all six children); tr. 46 (Plaintiff's testimony in February 2011 that she lives with only one of her children)). Her past relevant work includes work as a pharmacy technician, housekeeper, and janitor (see, e.g., tr. 212).5 She was released from her most recent full-time job (as a pharmacy technician) in July 2006, and she testified that she had not "work[ed] since then" (tr. 33-34, 415). She explained that she lost her job "because of having to be gone for [physical] therapy, my bosses did not work with me as far as reducing my hours, giving me different duties or allowing me to miss any work" (tr. 162).6 She described her back pain as constant and severe (i.e., an eight to ten on a ten-point scale ("8-10/10") without medication and an 8/10 with the use of Norco), although she also noted that with the use of medication she was "pretty well much stable" (tr. 37-40). Plaintiff further indicated that the pain occasionally goes down her left leg and causes numbness and tingling (tr. 37). Finally, she claimed to be extremely limited in her ability to sit, walk, lift anything, raise her arms, extend her hands, perform household chores, engage in social activities and hobbies, drive, work, or (essentially) perform any physical activity whatsoever other than boil a pot of lima beans and occasionally visit her sister or shop (see tr. 40-41, 43, 47-49, 51-54).7 
B. Relevant Medical History
2006 
On June 21, 2006, Plaintiff picked up a box at work and immediately felt pain in her lower back. The next day she presented to an emergency room ("ER"), where she received a Demerol shot and a prescription for Lortab, which—according to Plaintiff—"help[ed] for a while" (tr. 292).
A scan of Plaintiff's lumbar spine was obtained on July 3, 2006 (the record does not indicate the precise nature of the scan, for example, whether it was an x-ray or magnetic resonance imaging ("MRI"), but it appears it was a MRI (see[*4] tr. 252), and thus the court will refer to it as such). The MRI showed "some disc protrusion at [illegible, but presumably L5]-S1, mildly effacing the thecal sac, [with] no nerve root compression," a mild bulging disc at L4-5, and a moderately sized annular tear at L5-S1 (id.). An electromyogram and nerve conduction velocity study ("EMG/NCV") of the right lower extremity was normal (id.). On or about July 19, 2006, Douglas L. Stringer, M.D., examined Plaintiff and released her for work on July 24, 2006, but he limited her to half-days initially, with no lifting more than ten pounds for one week, after which (i.e., on or about July 31, 2006) Plaintiff would be permitted to work eight-hour days (tr. 250).
Plaintiff participated in physical therapy ("PT") in or about the month of July 2006, for lower back and right leg pain 8 (see tr. 219-33). She attended nine of twelve scheduled visits (she cancelled one visit and failed to show for two others) and was discharged due to inconsistent attendance (tr. 217). In a progress report dated August 31, 2006, Plaintiff's physical therapist stated that she had improved with therapy (see id.). More specifically, the therapist noted that Plaintiff demonstrated "improvement in lumbar [range of motion] to 50% flexion, 50% extension, and 50% SB," and her "[t]ransitional movements and gait [were] more normalized and less antalgic" (id.; see also tr. 231, 223 (PT records noting that Plaintiff was "moving much better," and her gait was "noticeably improve[d]"); tr. 228 (PT record noting Plaintiff's reported pain as a 3/10 on July 10, which was significantly lower that the 10/10 she reported at her first PT visit (see tr. 232))). The therapist also noted that Plaintiff had returned to work and was working four hours a day (tr. 217).
Also in August 2006, Dr. Stringer noted that although Plaintiff reported pain with straight leg raising tests, there was no radicular component (tr. 251). He also observed that Plaintiff had normal upper extremity strength, lower extremity strength, sensation, and deep tendon reflexes, although she displayed a "limping gait" (tr. 252). After interviewing Plaintiff, examining her, and reviewing the lumbar MRI from July 2006, Dr. Stringer assessed lumbar disc disease with low back pain and severe lumbar facet pain but no evidence of nerve root compression (id.). Between approximately August and December 2006, Plaintiff received lumbar paravertebral nerve blocks and facet joint injections from Dr. Stringer, and she was prescribed Lortab following these procedures (see tr. 237-38, 247, 249, 253, 264, 288).
2007 
Plaintiff received additional nerve blocks and facet injections in January and February 2007, as well as short-term prescriptions for Lortab (see, e.g., 274, 280). Following the January injections, Plaintiff reported that her back pain had decreased from a 9/10 to a 2/10 (tr. 274). Following the February injections, Merle P. Stringer, M.D., noted that Plaintiff's pain had decreased and her range of motion had increased (tr. 275).9 On December 12 2007, Plaintiff presented to E. Jacob, M.D., a neurologist, and reported severe back pain that radiated into both lower extremities (tr. 328). After conducting [*5] a physical examination, Dr. Jacob was concerned that some radiculopathy may be present, so he ordered a lumbar MRI, as well as an EMG/NCV (tr. 330). The lumbar MRI was obtained on December 28, 2007, and it showed minimal degenerative changes at L5-S1 with a small annual tear but no evidence of disc herniation or nerve root compression (see tr. 327, 335).
2008 
On February 7, 2008, Todd Crawford, M.D., with Spinal Associates, saw Plaintiff "in consultation for Vocational Rehabilitation" (tr. 337). Plaintiff presented with complaints of pain and burning in the lower back and pain in the left leg (id.). Dr. Crawford conducted a physical examination and reviewed the December 2007 MRI—which, he stated, revealed only "mild" findings—and thereafter he assessed "low back pain, most likely myofascial" (tr. 335). Dr. Crawford noted that Plaintiff was not a surgical candidate and that "her best option is physical reconditioning with strengthening, flexibility and walking" (id.). He encouraged Plaintiff to walk every day and perform the exercises she learned in PT, and he opined that her pain would likely improve if she followed his recommendations (id.). Dr. Crawford scheduled no follow-up visit with Plaintiff but advised her he would see her on an "as needed" basis (tr. 334).
On March 18, 2008, Plaintiff presented to the Community Health Center of Bay County, Florida ("CHC") with complaints of lower back pain (tr. 370). She was prescribed Flexeril and Voltaren (id.).
Plaintiff returned to Dr. Crawford on July 31, 2008, and complained of back pain and tingling in the left leg (tr. 333). Dr. Crawford essentially reiterated his opinions regarding Plaintiff's candidacy for surgery and need to be physically active (id.). Additionally, after Plaintiff described her job duties as a pharmacy technician, Dr. Crawford opined that she could return to that work (id.). Plaintiff returned to Spinal Associates on December 18, 2008, and saw Michael X. Rohan, Jr., D.O. (see tr. 332). Plaintiff had lost over twenty pounds since her first visit with Dr. Crawford in February 2008 (see tr. 332, 336). She again complained of back pain, which she rated as a 7/10, and she stated that the pain radiated into her right leg (tr. 332). She also reported that she tried to return to work but was unable to work (id.). Dr. Rohan recommended an updated lumbar MRI, which Plaintiff obtained the following day. The MRI revealed mild left neuroforaminal stenosis at L4-5 secondary to disk protrusion and an annular tear at L5-S1, but no nerve root impingement was seen, no significant spinal stenosis was evident, and the remaining levels of the lumbar spine were normal (tr. 295, 326). Plaintiff returned to Dr. Rohan on December 30, 2008, and reported that her pain was constant, and at a 5/10 (tr. 332). After reviewing the MRI, Dr. Rohan assessed L5-S1 annular tear and stated that Plaintiff "may need surgery" (id.).
2009 
On January 8, 2009, Plaintiff reported to the office of Aaron J. Shores, M.D., a pain management specialist, and complained of lower back pain radiating down the right leg to the foot that started on June 21, 2006, after she picked up a box at work (tr. 292). She told Dr. Shores that neither [*6] the injections administered by Dr. Stringer, nor the PT, had "helped her" (id.). A comprehensive physical examination was largely unremarkable, with the exception of some lumbar tenderness, and it resulted in Dr. Shores' ruling out neurologic symptoms (see tr. 294-95). After conducting this examination and reviewing the December 2008 MRI, Dr. Shores assessed chronic low back pain, possibly discogenic in nature, and he noted that Plaintiff may never be completely pain free (tr. 295). He gave Plaintiff various prescriptions including Norco and recommended that she undergo a lumbar discogram to determine the origin of her pain (id.). On January 28, 2009, Dr. Shores completed a questionnaire and indicated that Plaintiff had DDD with gait disturbance, chronic pain, radiculopathy, soft tissue injury, and limited range of motion (without specifics), but that Plaintiff's grip strength and lower extremity strength were full at 5/5 (tr. 304). Dr. Shores also opined that Plaintiff did not require a hand-held device to ambulate and was capable of performing fine or gross manipulation on a sustained basis (id.). Plaintiff returned to Dr. Shores on February 2, 2009, and rated her back pain as a 6/10 (tr. 398). Dr. Shores renewed her Norco prescription and indicated that a diagnostic discogram would be scheduled in order to confirm (or, presumably, rule out) discogenic pain (tr. 398-99).
On February 9, 2009, Plaintiff underwent a lumbar spine computerized tomography ("CT") scan (tr. 324). The impression was: (1) "[a]t L5-S1 contrast extravasates from the nucleus pulposus in the midline into a small central disk bulge which does not result in significant neural foraminal narrowing or spinal canal stenosis"; and (2) "[r]adial tears . . . at L3-4 and L4-5 [and, at] L4-5 a right posterolateral disk bulge narrow [sic] the right neural foramen and contacts [sic] the exiting rightsided L4 spinal nerve" (id.). The same day, Plaintiff underwent a lumbar discogram, which recreated concordant disk pain at L4-5 and L5-S1 but yielded negative results at L3-4 (tr. 426-27).
Plaintiff returned to Dr. Rohan on March 4, 2009, and rated her lower back pain as a 4/10 (tr. 317). She noted that the pain was aggravated with standing too long, twisting, bending, and lifting but stated that the pain was relieved with medications (id.). After examining Plaintiff and reviewing the discogram results, Dr. Rohan assessed discogenic back pain (id.). He discussed treatment options with Plaintiff, including surgical options, and he advised Plaintiff that he could not guarantee a reduction in her pain following surgery, but "on average she could expect a 50% reduction in her back pain" (id.). He also opined that Plaintiff was "100% disabled from any meaningful employment" (id.). Similarly, in a later dated March 5, 2009, Dr. Rohan stated "I feel that [Plaintiff] is 100% disabled from an employment perspective" (tr. 341).
Plaintiff returned to Dr. Shores on April 9, 2009, and rated her back pain as a 6/10 (tr. 396). Dr. Shores conducted a physical examination and noted, with regard to the musculoskeletal portion of the examination, that "some of [Plaintiff's] pain responses [were] out of [*7] proportion to the examination" (id.). He assessed chronic low back pain, discogenic in nature, secondary to L4-5 and L5-S1 disk pain; symptom magnification; and myofascial pain syndrome (id.). He renewed Plaintiff's Norco prescriptions, scheduled an injection, and referred Plaintiff for PT (two times a week for four weeks) (tr. 397). The injection—a L5-S1 interlaminar epidural steroid injection ("ESI")—was administered on April 24, 2009 (tr. 410). Plaintiff returned to Dr. Shores on May 11, 2009, and stated that her pain was "50% improved" and that she had decreased her Norco usage (tr. 394-95). Dr. Shores renewed the Norco prescription but lowered the dose (tr. 395). Plaintiff returned on May 21, 2009, and told Dr. Shores she was "50% to 60% improved and using less Norco (tr. 393). Thereafter, Plaintiff cancelled two scheduled ESI procedures (see tr. 390, 409). Plaintiff next reported to Dr. Shores on August 5, 2009 (tr. 380-81). She stated she had not been taking Norco for several months or any pain medication in several weeks and that her pain returned to a 7/10 (tr. 380). Dr. Shores prescribed Norco, scheduled an ESI, and scheduled an EMG/NCV of the bilateral upper extremities (tr. 381). On August 19, 2009, Plaintiff underwent an L5-S1 interlaminar ESI, and in early September 2009, she reported that the injection provided 70-80 % relief for about a week (tr. 378, 388-89). She informed Dr. Shores she was taking no more than one Norco tablet a day and that on some days she took none (tr. 378). In late September Plaintiff stated that she had been using one tablet of Norco per day, "and was actually doing quite well, to the point that she was able to stop the Norco," although she had a "pain flare" that prompted an ER visit, and she rated her current pain level as an 8/10 (tr. 376). Dr. Shores scheduled an ESI and renewed the Norco (tr. 377).
Plaintiff again saw Dr. Shores in October and December 2009, and he administered interlaminar ESIs (tr. 384-87). Also in late 2009, Plaintiff returned to the CHC with complaints of lower back pain (see tr. 357). A physical examination, which included an examination of Plaintiff's extremities, was entirely within normal limits, and Plaintiff was assessed with back pain (tr. 358). The CHC notes reflect that Plaintiff was under Dr. Shore's care and, it appears, that CHC staff deferred treatment decisions to Dr. Shores (see id.).10 
2010 
On January 6, 2010, Dr. Shores administered facet joint diagnostic medial branch blocks at various levels of the spine and a confirmatory injection (see tr. 382, 375), and on January 14, 2010, Plaintiff reported 20% relief after the blocks/injection (tr. 372, 383). Dr. Shores concluded that Plaintiff was running out of options, as she was not a good surgical candidate, and he asked Plaintiff to consider the use of a spinal cord stimulator (tr. 372-73). Plaintiff returned to Dr. Shores on March 17, 2010, and rated her pain as a 6/10 (tr. 437). Dr. Shores noted that Plaintiff "only takes [her] medication when [the pain] gets really bad," and when she does she takes the Norco twice daily; he also noted Plaintiff's report that the "medication does help" (tr. 437-38). Dr. Shores again discussed with Plaintiff conservative treatment [*8] measures, including the use of a spinal cord stimulator, and he renewed the Norco and advised Plaintiff to return the following month (tr. 438),
Plaintiff continued treatment with Dr. Shores and his partner Robert Joseph, M.D., between April and November 2010. She rated her back pain between a 7/10 and a 9/10 (tr. 433, 435, 441, 443); she reported that the pain radiated into the left leg and foot (tr. 435, 443); and she stated that medication "helped" the pain (tr. 429, 431, 433, 436, 442, 444).11 Additionally, on May 21, 2010, Plaintiff received a lumbar ESI (tr. 439-40), which—she reported in June 2010—resulted in a 50% improvement in her pain (tr. 431). In or about June 2010, Dr. Shores reiterated his opinion that he did not believe Plaintiff was a surgical candidate, but he referred Plaintiff to a spinal surgeon for a second opinion (id.). Dr. Joseph's notes from July 2010 reflect that the spinal surgeon, "Dr. Desilva," essentially concurred with the opinion of Dr. Shores (see id.). Dr. Joseph's notes also reflect Plaintiff's report that the May 21 ESI was "still helping" and that she was not sure that she wanted to use the spinal cord stimulator (tr. 429). October 4, 2010, Plaintiff reported burning pain across her upper back that radiated into her left lower extremity that was worse with "sitting straight up" (tr. 443). She stated she had a new granddaughter and had been going back and forth to the hospital in Pensacola (presumably from the Panama City area) (tr. 443). An examination revealed a non-antalgic gait, upright station, full motor tone and strength, negative straight leg raising tests, and lumbar tenderness (tr. 443-44). On November 3, 2010, Plaintiff's final visit with a health practitioner that is documented in the record, Plaintiff reported that: "She does not want surgery. She does not want the spinal cord stimulator. She does not do any stretches or exercise. She uses the [CHC] for her primary care." (tr. 441). Plaintiff also stated that she would like to go back to work and that she would like to do so even if was to "clean[] toilets" (id.). Dr. Joseph conducted a physical examination which revealed a slow but non-antalgic gait, upright station, mild tenderness to palpation of the lumbar spine, positive forward bending, negative straight leg raising tests, no pain with extension, full strength and motor tone, and symmetrical reflexes (id.). Dr. Joseph noted:
We had tried the radiofrequency, the DMBBs [branch blocks], the injections and physical therapy along with L[umbar]ESIs which she said did not help. She does not want to try the spinal cord stimulator. This does not leave much else but pain pills and as such, it is not the appropriate treatment as she is young and she has a fixable problem.
(tr. 442). He further noted, "She has been out of work for three years as a pharmacy tech [but] can sit and stand. Cleaning the toilets require total bending over and being on your hands and knees and with her education and training it is not something she should be thinking of doing. She needs to decide what she wants to do." (id.). He discussed with Plaintiff the continuation of conservative treatment options and renewed her medications (id.).

C. Other [*9] Information Within Plaintiff's Claim File
On April 15, 2009, Harry Beecham, M.D., a non-examining agency physician, completed a physical RFC assessment form after reviewing the most recent lumbar imaging reports and other pertinent information in Plaintiff's claims file (tr. 342-49). He opined that Plaintiff can occasionally lift or carry twenty pounds, frequently lift or carry ten pounds, and stand, walk, or sit about six hours in an eight-hour workday (tr. 343). He further opined that Plaintiff has an unlimited ability to push or pull, subject to the foregoing weight restrictions, but has no other restrictions or limitations (see tr. 343-46). Finally, Dr. Beecham opined that "some [of Plaintiff's] allegations and symptoms . . . appear . . . to be disproportionate to the expected severity and duration that would be expected on the basis of [Plaintiff's] medically determinable impairment[]" (namely, lumbar DDD) (see tr. 342, 347). Also in early 2009, another non-examining agency specialist rendered nearly identical conclusions as to Plaintiff's RFC and credibility (see tr. 305-12).
V. DISCUSSION
In the memorandum in support of her complaint, Plaintiff twice identifies the issues in this appeal as follows:
The Plaintiff is unable to perform light work based on her degenerative disc condition. Although the Plaintiff may have emphasized her physical problems in the testimony she has objective medical evidence that supports the level of pain that she assserts [sic] and may have misunderstood the questions presented at the hearing[.] 
(doc. 18 at 2, 7). It thus appears that Plaintiff challenges the ALJ's RFC determination and credibility findings, and that these are her only challenges. In the body of the memorandum, however, Plaintiff appears to additionally challenge the ALJ's rejection of the opinion of Dr. Rohan that Plaintiff is "100% disabled" (see id. at 7). Although Plaintiff is represented by counsel, and her counsel has an obligation to properly frame and brief the issues, the undersigned will nevertheless liberally construe her memorandum as asserting three claims for relief, and will discuss those claims in the following order: Dr. Rohan's opinion, Plaintiff's credibility, and the RFC determination.

A. The Opinion of Dr. Rohan
As detailed supra, Plaintiff first presented to Dr. Rohan on December 18, 2008, almost thirty months after the date she alleges she became disabled. Dr. Rohan ordered an updated lumbar MRI, and after reviewing the results of the MRI he opined, on December 30, 2008, that Plaintiff had an annular tear and possibly needed surgery. At Plaintiff's third visit with Dr. Rohan, on March 4, 2009, Dr. Rohan opined that Plaintiff was "100% disabled," which opinion he repeated the following day. The ALJ rejected Dr. Rohan's opinion of disability, and Plaintiff (apparently) asserts error in this regard.
Substantial weight must be given to the opinion, diagnosis and medical evidence of a treating physician unless there is good cause to do otherwise. See Lewis v. Callahan, 125 F.3d 1436 , 1439- 1441 (11th Cir. 1997); Edwards v. Sullivan, 937 F.2d 580 , 583 (11th Cir. 1991); Sabo v. Chater, 955 F. Supp. 1456 , 1462 (M.D. Fla. 1996); 20 C.F.R. § 404.1527(d) . "'[G]ood [*10] cause' exists when the: (1) treating physician's opinion was not bolstered by the evidence; (2) evidence supported a contrary finding; or (3) treating physician's opinion was conclusory or inconsistent with the doctor's own medical records." Phillips v. Barnhart, 357 F.3d 1232 , 1240-41 (11th Cir. 2004) (citation omitted). The ALJ may discount a treating physician's opinion or report regarding an inability to work if it is unsupported by objective medical evidence or is wholly conclusory. See Edwards, 937 F.2d 580 (finding that the ALJ properly discounted treating physician's report where the physician was unsure of the accuracy of his findings and statements). However, if a treating physician's opinion on the nature and severity of a claimant's impairments is well supported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques, and is not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in the record, the ALJ must give it controlling weight. 20 C.F.R. § 404.1527(d)(2) .
When a treating physician's opinion does not warrant controlling weight, the ALJ must nevertheless weigh the medical opinion based on 1) the length of the treatment relationship and the frequency of examination; 2) the nature and extent of the treatment relationship; 3) medical evidence supporting the opinion; 4) consistency with the record as a whole; 5) specialization in the medical issues at issue; and 6) other factors which tend to support or contradict the opinion. 20 C.F.R. § 404.1527(d) . Generally, a treating physician's opinion is entitled to more weight than a consulting physician's opinion. See Wilson v. Heckler, 734 F.2d 513 , 518 (11th Cir. 1984); see also 20 C.F.R. § 404.1527(d)(2) .
The ALJ is required to review all of the medical findings and other evidence that support a medical source's statement that a claimant is disabled. However, the ALJ is responsible for making the ultimate determination about whether a claimant meets the statutory definition of disability. 20 C.F.R. § 404.1527(e) . The ALJ is not required to give any special significance to the status of a physician as treating or non-treating in weighing an opinion on whether Plaintiff meets a listed impairment, a claimant's RFC (see 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1545 and 404.1546 ), or the application of vocational factors, because those ultimate determinations are the province of the Commissioner. 20 C.F.R. § 404.1527(e) .
Here, in rejecting Dr. Rohan's opinion of total disability, the ALJ noted, correctly, that this opinion concerns a determination that is the province of the Commissioner (tr. 16). The ALJ also pointed to the conclusory nature of Dr. Rohan's opinion. More specifically, the ALJ noted that Dr. Rohan failed to explain why Plaintiff could not work by, for example, listing the limitations that precluded work (id.). Instead of explaining his opinion, the ALJ stated, Dr. Rohan merely opined that Plaintiff is "100 percent disabled" after he "subjectively accept[ed]" Plaintiff's "reports that she hurts and cannot work" (id.). Continuing, the ALJ found that Dr. Rohan's opinion is inconsistent with the overall evidence of record (id.). In support, the ALJ pointed to various portions of the record, including the following evidence: (1) the opinions of Dr. Crawford, a treating physician and colleague of [*11] Dr. Rohan at Spinal Associates, that Plaintiff could return to her work as a pharmacy technician and should engage in physical activity 12; (2) Dr. Shores' finding of inconsistencies upon his examination of Plaintiff and his diagnosis of symptom magnification; (3) Dr. Beecham's opinion that Plaintiff could perform work at a light exertional level; (4) the efficacy of the injections (as reported by Plaintiff) and Plaintiff's improvement with PT; (5) Dr. Joseph's essentially benign examination in October 2010; (6) the treatment notes from Plaintiff's last documented office visit (in November 2010), which reflect (a) Dr. Joseph's opinions/statements that Plaintiff has a "fixable problem," she will not consider using a spinal cord stimulator, and she has not exercised as instructed, and (b) Plaintiff's report that she wanted to go to work and would do so even if involved cleaning toilets 13; and (7) Plaintiff was able to go without pain medication on several occasions for extended periods (and, while not directly noted by the ALJ, the record also reflects that Plaintiff went without regular, ongoing treatment at various intervals during the relevant time frame, including during a large part of 2007 and after November 2010) (see tr. 15-17).
As can be seen, the ALJ clearly articulated his reasons for rejecting Dr. Rohan's opinion of total disability. Moreover, the reasons he stated are supported by substantial record evidence. Plaintiff, therefore, is not entitled to relief on this ground.
B. Plaintiff's Credibility
As previously discussed, Plaintiff testified that she is extraordinarily limited by pain and unable to do much of anything. The ALJ concluded that her complaints are not fully credible. More specifically, the ALJ found that Plaintiff's DDD could reasonably be expected to cause some pain and limitations, but Plaintiff's "statements concerning the intensity, persistence and limiting effects of these symptoms are not credible to the extent they are inconsistent with the [RFC]" (tr. 15). Plaintiff contends the ALJ erred in making this finding, but she does so merely by reciting her testimony (doc. 18 at 3-4) and the medical evidence of record (id. at 5-7). Plaintiff makes no legal argument and apparently seeks reversal on this claim based only on Plaintiff's testimony and the evidence she has identified but, as this court is well aware, such is not the standard for relief.
In Holt v. Sullivan, 921 F.2d 1221 , 1223 (11th Cir. 1991), the Eleventh Circuit articulated the "pain standard," which applies when a disability claimant attempts to establish a disability through his own testimony of pain or other subjective symptoms. The pain standard requires: (1) evidence of an underlying medical condition and either (a) objective medical evidence that confirms the severity of the alleged pain arising from that condition, or (b) that the objectively determined medical condition is of such a severity that it can be reasonably expected to give rise to the alleged pain. Holt, 921 F.2d at 1223 (internal citation omitted). If a claimant testifies as to her subjective complaints of disabling pain and other symptoms, [*12] as Plaintiff did here, the ALJ must clearly "articulate explicit and adequate reasons" for discrediting the claimant's allegations of completely disabling symptoms. Foote, 67 F.3d at 1561-62 . Additionally, "'[a]lthough this circuit does not require an explicit finding as to credibility, . . . the implication must be obvious to the reviewing court.'"  Id. at 1562 (quoting Tieniber v. Heckler, 720 F.2d 1251 , 1255 (11th Cir. 1983)). The credibility determination does not need to cite "'particular phrases or formulations'" but it cannot merely be a broad rejection which is "'not enough to enable [the district court or this Court] to conclude that [the ALJ] considered her medical condition as a whole.'" Id . (quoting Jamison v. Bowen, 814 F.2d 585 , 588-90 (11th Cir. 1987)).
Here, the ALJ identified the correct pain standard (see tr. 14). Then, in discounting Plaintiff's subjective complaints, he first noted that Plaintiff returned to work in 2007 as pharmacy technician (tr. 15). See 20 C.F.R. § 404.1571 (work performed during any period in which Plaintiff alleges that she was under a disability may demonstrate an ability to perform substantial gainful activity); Harris v. Barnhart, 356 F.3d 926 , 930 (8th Cir. 2004) ("it was also not unreasonable for the ALJ to note that Harris's . . . part-time work [was] inconsistent with her claim of disabling pain"). Next, the ALJ noted that although Plaintiff improved with PT, she was discharged due to inconsistent attendance (tr. 15). See 20 C.F.R. § 404.1530 ("Failure to follow a prescribed course of remedial treatment without good reason is grounds for denying an application for benefits."); see also Dawkins v. Bowen, 848 F.2d 1211 , 1213 (11th Cir. 1988) ("A medical condition that can reasonably be remedied either by surgery, treatment, or medication is not disabling.") (citation omitted). The ALJ then discussed his reasons for discounting Dr. Rohan's opinion of total disability, which reasons equally support his decision to find Plaintiff less than fully credible (see tr. 15-17), as the ALJ noted (see, e.g., tr. 17 (Plaintiff "has been able to go without pain medication on several occasions for extended periods, indicating that the severity of her condition is less than she is alleging")).
Because the ALJ clearly articulated his reasons for finding Plaintiff less than fully credible, and the reasons cited are substantially supported by the record, Plaintiff is not entitled to relief. See Foote, 67 F.3d at 1562 (a clearly articulated credibility finding with substantial supporting evidence in the record will not be disturbed by a reviewing court); MacGregor, 786 F.2d at 1054 (same).
C. The RFC Determination
The ALJ found that Plaintiff has the RFC to perform the full range of light work (and therefore can return to the past relevant work she performed at that level of exertion). Although Plaintiff contests this finding, she had not explained how the ALJ committed error in determining her RFC (she merely recites her testimony and the medical evidence of record). Despite Plaintiff's failure to develop this argument, the court has carefully considered the record and finds no error.
Residual functional capacity is an assessment, based upon all of the relevant evidence, of a claimant's remaining ability to do work despite her impairments. [*13] See Lewis v. Callahan, 125 F.3d 1436 , 1440 (11th Cir. 1997). As stated in 20 C.F.R. § 404.1545(a) , it is the most a claimant can still do despite her limitations. "It is the claimant's burden, and not the Social Security Commissioner's burden, to prove the claimant's RFC." Pearsall v. Massanari, 274 F.3d 1211 , 1217 (8th Cir. 2001). Although the RFC determination is a medical question, it is not based only on "medical" evidence, that is, evidence from medical reports or sources; rather, an ALJ has the duty, at step four, to assess RFC on the basis of all the relevant, credible evidence of record. See Phillips v. Barnhart, 357 F.3d 1232 , 1238 (11th Cir. 2004); McKinney v. Apfel, 228 F.3d 860 , 863 (8th Cir. 2000) (the Commissioner must determine a claimant's RFC based on all of the relevant evidence, including the medical records, observations of treating physicians and others, and an individual's own description of his limitations); Dykes v. Apfel, 223 F.3d 865 , 866-67 (8th Cir. 2000) (per curiam) (RFC is a determination based upon all the record evidence, but the record must include some medical evidence that supports the RFC finding). See also 20 C.F.R. § 404.1545 ; Social Security Ruling (SSR) 96-8p, 1996 SSR LEXIS 5 .
Here, the ALJ complied with his duty to assess the RFC based on all the relevant, credible evidence of record. He thoroughly summarized Plaintiff's testimony and the medical evidence, and after properly discounting Dr. Rohan's opinion and Plaintiff's complaints of extreme and disabling limitations, he determined Plaintiff's RFC. See McSwain v. Bowen, 814 F.2d 617 , 620 n.1 (11th Cir. 1987) (an ALJ need not include in the RFC limitations, restrictions, or opinions he has properly rejected or that are otherwise unsupported by the record). In relevant part, the ALJ considered the opinions of Dr. Crawford; the results of Plaintiff's physical examinations; Dr. Shores' finding—after examining Plaintiff—that Plaintiff exaggerated her symptoms; the opinions of Dr. Beecham, which are wholly consistent with the RFC (as are those of the other, non-examining agency specialist); and Plaintiff's ability to work as pharmacy technician after the alleged onset date, which work she performed at the light exertional level, as well as her stated desire to work cleaning toilets during the relevant time frame, which work would obviously require capacities beyond those set forth in Plaintiff's RFC (tr. 15-17).
Plaintiff had pointed to no error in the ALJ's reasoning and findings, and the undersigned has found none. To be sure, the undersigned easily concludes that the RFC is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole, and that no ground for reversal exits.
For the foregoing reasons, the Commissioner's decision is supported by substantial evidence and should not be disturbed. 42 U.S.C. § 405(g) ; Lewis, 125 F. 3d at 1439 ; Foote, 67 F.3d at 1560 . Furthermore, Plaintiff has failed to show that the ALJ applied improper legal standards, erred in making his findings, or that any other ground for reversal exists.
Accordingly, it is respectfully RECOMMENDED:
That the decision of the Commissioner be AFFIRMED, that this action be DISMISSED, and that the clerk be directed to close the file.
At Pensacola, Florida this 5th day of November 2013.

Thus, the time frame relevant to Plaintiff's claim for DIB is July 6, 2006 (date of alleged onset), through February 17, 2011 (date of ALJ's decision), even though Plaintiff was insured through June 2012. The time frame relevant to her claim for SSI is January 13, 2009 (the date she applied for SSI) through February 17, 2011. See Moore v. Barnhart, 405 F.3d 1208 , 1211 (11th Cir. 2005) (indicating that SSI claimant becomes eligible to receive benefits in the first month in which she is both disabled and has an SSI application on file). The court's review in this case will therefore focus, generally, on the evidence that relates to Plaintiff's condition between July 2006 and February 2011.

Light work is defined in 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1567(b) and 416.967(b) as follows:
Light work involves lifting no more than 20 pounds at a time with frequent lifting or carrying of objects weighing up to 10 pounds. Even though the weight lifted may be very little, a job is in this category when it requires a good deal of walking or standing, or when it involves sitting most of the time with some pushing and pulling of arm or leg controls. To be considered capable of performing a full or wide range of light work, you must have the ability to do substantially all of these activities. If someone can do light work, we determine that he or she can also do sedentary work, unless there are additional limiting factors such as loss of fine dexterity or inability to sit for long periods of time.

fn

In general, the legal standards applied are the same regardless of whether a claimant seeks DIB or SSI, but separate, parallel statutes and regulations exist for DIB and SSI claims (see20 C.F.R. §§ 404, 416). Therefore, hereinafter, citations in this Report should be considered to refer to the appropriate parallel provision. The same applies to citations of statutes or regulations found in quoted court decisions.

A vocational expert ("VE") testified at Plaintiff's hearing. After listening to Plaintiff's testimony, which included a description of her past relevant work, the VE characterized that work as follows: pharmacy technician (light exertional work, as defined by the Dictionary of Occupational Titles ("DOT") and as performed by Plaintiff); housekeeper (light, as defined by the DOT and as performed by Plaintiff); and janitor (medium, as defined by the DOT but light as performed by Plaintiff) (tr. 57-60; see also tr. 212). Thus, in light of the ALJ's RFC determination, the VE opined that Plaintiff could return to the pharmacy and housekeeping jobs without qualification and to the janitorial job as she previously performed it (tr. 60-61).

fn 
6
Although Plaintiff testified she had not worked since 2006, the record indicates that she worked as a pharmacy technician from April 2007 through June 2007 (see, e.g., tr. 136, 148-49), which work the Commissioner characterized as an "unsuccessful work attempt" that did not constitute substantial gainful employment (see tr. 13, 154).

fn 
7
During Plaintiff's hearing, the ALJ noted that a treatment record reflects a report by Plaintiff to one of her physicians, made November 3, 2010, that she wished to "go back to work cleaning toilets," and the ALJ asked Plaintiff whether she made this statement (tr. 35, 441). Plaintiff testified that she made no such statement to the physician (tr. 35).

fn 
8
As noted supra, Plaintiff testified that her back pain sometimes goes down into her left leg and, as will be seen infra, the most recent treatment records reflect similar complaints, but the PT records reflect complaints of pain going down into Plaintiffs right leg, as do some of the intervening treatment records.

fn 
9
Dr. Merle Stringer also explained that nerve blocks are administered to treat the "acute component" of pain, while facet injections are administered to treat the "deep component" of pain (tr. 274). The court notes that neurologists Douglas Stringer, M.D., and Merle Stringer, M.D.—who work in the same facility (see, e.g., tr. 262)—each treated Plaintiff during the relevant period (it also appears that their records, some of which are illegible, are co-mingled). For these reasons, the court cannot definitively distinguish between the two physicians in reviewing all of their treatment records. For the sake of simplicity, the court will hereafter refer to these physicians as one individual, "Dr. Stringer."

fn 
10
The CHC notes also reflect visits by Plaintiff between March 2008 and November 2009 for check-ups and treatment of various ailments other than back pain (tr. 353-70). She indicated on only one of these visits that she was taking pain medication (tr. 359).

fn 
11
Plaintiff's reports regarding the efficacy of her pain medication varied at times (e.g., during one visit she stated her pain medication was not lasting long enough and during another she stated she could do "without the medications at all" (see tr. 429, 443)).

fn 
12
Dr. Stringer also released Plaintiff to work.

fn 
13
As discussed infra, in finding Plaintiff less than fully credible, the ALJ relied on many of the same reasons he relied on in discounting the opinions of Dr. Rohan, and those reasons need not be repeated in the next section of this Report. Thus, the undersigned notes here that Plaintiff's desire to return to work is inconsistent with disability and indicates that she did not view her pain as disabling, despite her claims of disabling pain. See Bentley v. Shalala, 52 F.3d 784 , 786 (8th Cir. 1995); Barrett v. Shalala, 38 F.3d 1019 , 1024 (8th Cir. 1994) (claimant's statements that he was seeking work are inconsistent with disability). Although Plaintiff testified that she did not tell Dr. Joseph she would return to work even if involved cleaning toilets, Dr. Joseph's treatment notes refute Plaintiff's testimony. As detailed supra, Dr. Joseph's treatment notes clearly and unequivocally document Plaintiff's statement and include his own opinions about the statement, all of which undermines Plaintiff's testimony and, correspondingly, her credibility.

Jonathan Goodman 
[CONSENT CASE] 
ORDER DENYING DEFENDANT PATHEON'S "MOTION FOR JUDGMENT" 
(BUT PROVIDING OTHER RELIEF)
Plaintiff Procaps, S.A. filed this lawsuit, which primarily seeks treble damages under the federal antitrust laws, in December 2012. [ECF No. 1]. Since then, Defendant Patheon Inc. has filed a motion to dismiss [ECF No. 34], a motion for judgment on the pleadings [ECF No. 170], a summary judgment motion [ECF No. 332] and a response to Procaps' motion for reconsideration of the Court's order on the competing summary judgment motions [ECF No. 580]. Not counting exhibits, Patheon's motions (with supporting memoranda and reply memoranda) total more than 150 pages. The Court also held an all-day hearing on Patheon's summary judgment motion (and Procaps' summary judgment motion) [ECF No. 484] and entered a 52—page ruling on the summary judgment motions [ECF No. 565].
After the close of discovery and after the protracted litigation outlined above (i.e., there are now 606 docket entries as of October 20, 2014), Patheon has now filed a request for relief it calls a "Motion for Judgment," arguing, in essence, that Procaps cannot prove its case under the rule of reason standard which this Court determined is the type of analysis appropriate to evaluate Procaps' antitrust claim. [ECF No. 581]. Patheon alleges that Procaps has not adequately disclosed its rule of reason theory because it focused on a per se claim and repeatedly disavowed an intent to proceed under any type of rule of reason approach. [ Id. at p. 2]. Patheon also alleges that Procaps avoided discovery obligations by persuading Patheon and the Court, [*2] based on representations about the nature of the case, that certain discovery was irrelevant because it related only to a per se claim which was not then being pursued. [ Id. at pp. 6-9].
There is no doubt that Procaps focused its energies on a per se claim. Likewise, it is also correct that Procaps repeatedly advised that it would not litigate its claim under a rule of reason approach. [ Id.]. However, it is also true that Procaps ultimately advised, at the summary judgment hearing, that it would still pursue its claim if it lost on its per se theory -- but would accept Patheon's market definitions.
During discovery, Procaps avoided its obligation to provide certain discovery responses relating to a rule of reason approach by taking the position that the discovery was irrelevant. [See e.g. ECF No. 147]. Based on these concessions, Patheon agreed to not pursue and compel certain discovery. [ECF No. 146, p. 5]. Given Procaps' current position that it will now be pursuing a rule of reason antitrust claim, some of the discovery responses it avoided are now relevant.
Given this procedural history, and notwithstanding Procaps' representations about pursuing only a per se theory, the Undersigned is not now going to impose the most-severe remedy and simply enter judgment in Patheon's favor based on a failure to supplement discovery responses or its obvious change in focus following the Court's ruling on the competing summary judgment motions. Therefore, the Court denies Patheon's Motion for Judgment.
Nevertheless, the Undersigned is not going to permit Procaps' strategic shift to unduly prejudice Patheon.
Therefore, Procaps shall by November 24, 2014 provide to Patheon all discovery responses it did not previously provide because it induced Patheon to drop efforts to compel production based on representations that it was proceeding solely on a per se rule and would not be invoking the rule of reason. Therefore, Procaps must provide a full, in-depth, comprehensive response to Interrogatory 20 (and others, if applicable) and must produce the responsive documents and ESI it previously failed to produce because Patheon and the Court accepted at face value its protestations about not using a rule of reason mode of analysis.
Recognizing the acrimony inherent in this litigation and in an effort to avoid further undue delay, the Court is requiring the parties to confer about discovery within the next few days and attempt to agree upon which discovery responses must be provided. If the parties cannot agree, then they must by October 28, 2014 advise the Court of the logjam so that the Court can schedule a hearing to resolve the dispute.
Because the Undersigned does not know what discovery will be provided, Patheon is likely unable to now predict whether the discovery it will soon receive will generate the need for additional depositions or other types of discovery. The Court is not now determining whether it will permit Patheon to seek additional discovery after receiving the discovery which Procaps will soon be providing, but it will [*3] give Patheon the opportunity to file a motion seeking additional discovery. In the absence of extremely compelling circumstances, the Court will not allow Procaps that opportunity, as it is Procaps who created this dilemma by repeatedly advising that the case was based only on a per se rule.
In addition to requiring Procaps to provide discovery, the Court is also going to permit Patheon to file a summary judgment motion (limited solely to the issue of whether Procaps has established a prima facie antitrust claim under the rule of reason analysis). The motion, if filed, may not reargue any of the arguments previously raised in Patheon's first summary judgment motion. Procaps may not file another summary judgment motion, however. The Court is not yet establishing a deadline for Patheon's to-be-filed summary judgment motion because it will depend on when Procaps provides the discovery it previously withheld, what information is disclosed pursuant to the forensic analysis of Procaps' ESI and whether additional depositions or other discovery (propounded by Patheon) will be permitted. The Undersigned will issue a scheduling order on this summary judgment motion deadline when additional developments unfold.

ELIZABETH M. TIMOTHY, UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE.

ELIZABETH M. TIMOTHY 
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
This case has been referred to the undersigned magistrate judge pursuant to the authority of 28 U.S.C. § 636(b) and Local Rules 72.1(A), 72.2(D) and 72.3 of this court relating to review of administrative determinations under the Social Security Act ("Act") and related statutes, 42 U.S.C. § 401 , et seq. It is now before the court pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 405(g) of the Act for review of a final determination of the Commissioner of Social Security ("Commissioner") denying Plaintiff's application for disability insurance benefits ("DIB") under Title II of the Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 401-34 .
Upon review of the record before this court, it is the opinion of the undersigned that the findings of fact and determinations of the Commissioner are supported by substantial evidence; thus, the decision of the Commissioner should be affirmed.
I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY
On June 9, 2008, Plaintiff filed an application for DIB and alleged therein disability beginning June 2, 2008 (tr. 8). 1 Her application was denied initially and on reconsideration, and Plaintiff then requested a hearing before an administrative law judge ("ALJ"). A hearing was held on July 15, 2010, and on August 18, 2010, the ALJ issued a decision in which he found Plaintiff "not disabled," as defined under the Act, at any time through the date of his decision (tr. 8-24). On October 27, 2011, the Appeals Council denied Plaintiff's request for review (tr. 1). Thus, the decision of the ALJ stands as the final decision of the Commissioner, subject to review in this court. Ingram v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec. Admin., 496 F.3d 1253 , 1262 (11th Cir. 2007). This appeal followed.
II. FINDINGS OF THE ALJ
In his written decision dated August 18, 2010, the ALJ made the following findings relevant to the issues raised in this appeal (see tr. 8-24):
1) Plaintiff meets the insured status requirements of the Act through December 31, 2013. 2 
2) Plaintiff has not engaged in substantial gainful activity since the alleged onset date.
3) Plaintiff's severe impairments include lumbar spondylosis, mild bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, anxiety, major depressive disorder, and chronic pain, but she has no impairment or combination of impairments that meets or medically equals a listed impairment.
4) Plaintiff has the residual functional capacity ("RFC") to perform light work, 3 except she must avoid working at unprotected heights. She has no mental limitations in her ability to perform unskilled work activities but has moderate limitations in her ability to perform semi-skilled work activity; to interact with members of the general public, co-workers and supervisors; and to respond appropriately [*2] to routine changes in a normal, routine work setting.
5) Plaintiff can perform her past relevant work as an administrative assistant/general clerk because such does work not require the performance of work-related activities precluded by her RFC; alternatively, Plaintiff can perform other work existing in the national economy. Plaintiff, therefore, has not been under a disability from June 2, 2008, through August 18, 2010.

III. STANDARD OF REVIEW
Review of the Commissioner's final decision is limited to determining whether the decision is supported by substantial evidence from the record and was a result of the application of proper legal standards. Carnes v. Sullivan, 936 F.2d 1215 , 1218 (11th Cir. 1991) ("[T]his Court may reverse the decision of the [Commissioner] only when convinced that it is not supported by substantial evidence or that proper legal standards were not applied."); see also Lewis v. Callahan, 125 F.3d 1436 , 1439 (11th Cir. 1997); Walker v. Bowen, 826 F.2d 996 , 999 (11th Cir. 1987). "A determination that is supported by substantial evidence may be meaningless . . . if it is coupled with or derived from faulty legal principles." Boyd v. Heckler, 704 F.2d 1207 , 1209 (11th Cir. 1983), superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in Elam v. R.R. Ret. Bd., 921 F.2d 1210 , 1214 (11th Cir. 1991). As long as proper legal standards were applied, the Commissioner's decision will not be disturbed if in light of the record as a whole the decision appears to be supported by substantial evidence. 42 U.S.C. § 405(g) ; Falge, 150 F.3d at 1322 ; Lewis, 125 F.3d at 1439 ; Foote v. Chater, 67 F.3d 1553 , 1560 (11th Cir. 1995). Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but not a preponderance; it is "such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion." Richardson v. Perales, 402 U.S. 389 , 401 , 91 S. Ct. 1420 , 1427 , 28 L. Ed. 2d 842 (1971) (quoting Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, 305 U.S. 197 , 59 S. Ct. 206 , 217 , 83 L. Ed. 126 (1938)); Lewis, 125 F.3d at 1439 . The court may not decide the facts anew, reweigh the evidence, or substitute its judgment for that of the Commissioner. Martin v. Sullivan, 894 F.2d 1520 , 1529 (11th Cir. 1990) (citations omitted). Even if the evidence preponderates against the Commissioner's decision, the decision must be affirmed if supported by substantial evidence. Sewell v. Bowen, 792 F.2d 1065 , 1067 (11th Cir. 1986).
The Act defines a disability as an "inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months." 42 U.S.C. § 423(d)(1)(A) . To qualify as a disability the physical or mental impairment must be so severe that the claimant is not only unable to do her previous work, "but cannot, considering [her] age, education, and work experience, engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy." Id. § 423(d)(2)(A).
Pursuant to 20 C.F.R. § 404.1520(a) —(g), the Commissioner analyzes a disability claim in five steps:
1. If the claimant is performing substantial gainful activity, she is not disabled.
2. If the claimant is not performing substantial gainful activity, her impairments must be severe before she can be found disabled.
3. If the claimant is not performing substantial gainful activity and she has severe impairments that have lasted or are expected [*3] to last for a continuous period of at least twelve months, and if her impairments meet or medically equal the criteria of any impairment listed in 20 C.F.R. Part 404 , Subpart P, Appendix 1, the claimant is presumed disabled without further inquiry.
4. If the claimant's impairments do not prevent her from doing her past relevant work, she is not disabled.
5. Even if the claimant's impairments prevent her from performing her past relevant work, if other work exists in significant numbers in the national economy that accommodates her RFC and vocational factors, she is not disabled.
The claimant bears the burden of establishing a severe impairment that keeps her from performing her past work. 20 C.F.R. § 404.1512 . If the claimant establishes such an impairment, the burden shifts to the Commissioner at step five to show the existence of other jobs in the national economy which, given the claimant's impairments, the claimant can perform. MacGregor v. Bowen, 786 F.2d 1050 , 1052 (11th Cir. 1986). If the Commissioner carries this burden, the claimant must then prove she cannot perform the work suggested by the Commissioner. Hale v. Bowen, 831 F.2d 1007 , 1011 (11th Cir. 1987).
IV. PLAINTIFF'S PERSONAL, EMPLOYMENT AND MEDICAL HISTORY
A. Personal and Employment History
Plaintiff, who was forty-nine years of age at the time of her hearing before the ALJ in July 2010 (tr. 43), attended regular classes in high school and obtained a General Equivalency Diploma (tr. 43, 200). She worked as a CNA/home health aide for Covenant Hospice ("CH") from 1992 through 2002. Her duties included lifting patients, bathing patients, and otherwise attending to patients' needs (tr. 46-47). In 2002 Plaintiff injured her back on the job, and due to resulting physical limitations her duties at CH were modified to those of an administrative assistant (tr. 44-45). Her job duties, as modified, included filing, answering the phone, and performing other clerical tasks ( id.). Plaintiff was terminated or "forced out" by CH on June 2, 2008 (the date she alleges she became disabled), because her position was eliminated (tr. 48, 191). She testified she would have continued working at CH had she not been forced out (tr. 66). Plaintiff also testified that after she was terminated by CH she applied for and received unemployment compensation benefits (through the spring of 2010) (tr. 48-49). She explained that in order to receive those benefits she was required to search for jobs, and that she did so by applying for jobs with nursing homes, convenience stores, and grocery stores (tr. 49). She testified she felt capable of performing a job that would permit her to freely alternate between sitting and standing ( id.). She also testified that she continued to apply for jobs even after her unemployment benefits were discontinued, including as recently as at or near the time of her hearing before the ALJ (see tr. 50).
At the time of Plaintiff's hearing she lived with her boyfriend and engaged in daily activities such as playing on the computer, "getting around the house," and walking in the yard (tr. 58, 60). She testified, however, that she could not shop, walk more than 100 yards without a break, or perform household chores ([*4] except to fold laundry) (tr. 59-60). 4 She further testified she had back pain that worsened with standing, sitting, walking or bending and improved with lying down, which she did (or took naps) three to four times a day (tr. 58-59). Plaintiff also reported that she was depressed, which affected her ability to concentrate, and that since September 2006 she experienced anxiety attacks once or twice a week, each of ten to twenty minutes duration (tr. 62; see also tr. 207 (Plaintiff's report in August 2008 that she experienced anxiety attacks every two weeks)).
B. Medical History
Treating or Examining Physicians or Evaluators (pre-June 2, 2008, the alleged onset date) 
The medical record in this case consists of 510 pages (see tr. 255-765), approximately 300 of which concern treatment Plaintiff received prior to the date she alleges she became disabled, including treatment for the injury that occurred at CH in November 2002 (see tr. 255-536, 545-51). The earlier treatment records, however, are generally relevant to the issues raised in this appeal and thus are included in the summary of Plaintiff's medical history. The earlier records reflect that Plaintiff sustained a back injury on November 15, 2002, while performing her duties as a CNA/home health aide for CH (tr. 12). She received physical therapy from November 27, 2002, through December 3, 2002 (see tr. 271, 288). On December 20, 2002, a physician (whose name is not legible) returned Plaintiff to work with modified duties (i.e., no bending, stooping, heavy lifting, or pushing or pulling more than fifteen to twenty pounds) (tr. 289). And on January 28, 2003, Plaintiff was released to full duty work by Gregg A. Alexander, M.D., an orthopedist (see tr. 12, 290; see also tr. 306 (another physician's release to full duty work on December 17, 2002)). Dr. Alexander opined that Plaintiff would reach maximum medical improvement ("MMI") in two months (or in or about March 2003), and he assessed a 6% whole person permanent impairment rating (see tr. 311).
On May 8, 2003, Sean Fitzgerald, M.D., a neurosurgeon, examined Plaintiff in connection with her complaints of back pain and left leg pain reportedly caused by her work injury (tr. 12, 275). He also reviewed the results of a recent magnetic resonance imaging scan ("MRI"), which appears to have been obtained on January 6, 2003 ( id.; see also tr. 402). Dr. Fitzgerald noted that the MRI revealed a "small bulge to the annulus in the foramen on the left," which did not deviate but did approximate the L5 nerve root on exit (tr. 275). Dr. Fitzgerald opined that surgical intervention and epidural injections were unnecessary because no radicular component was present ( id.). On June 19, 2003, Dr. Fitzgerald opined that Plaintiff could return to light duty work (tr. 273-74, 386-91).
In June of 2003, a licensed occupational therapist evaluated Plaintiff and concluded that Plaintiff could perform jobs requiring sedentary to light physical exertion (tr. 384-85).
On July 2, 2003, Plaintiff presented to Michael X. Rohan, M.D., an orthopedist (tr. 394). She reported she was unhappy with Dr. Fitzgerald's conclusions, and she requested another lumbar MRI (see id.). Dr. Rohan ordered [*5] an MRI and opined that Plaintiff could continue working in a "light" capacity (see tr. 394-97). The MRI, obtained on July 23, 2003, revealed "[d]egenerative changes primarily at L4-5 with mild-to-moderate left annular bulging with contained protrusion producing mild-to-moderate left foraminal narrowing and borderline canal narrowing," other changes that were "minimal-to-mild and of questionable significance," and straightening of the spine, consistent with strain or spasm (tr. 295, 416).
In July 2003, Plaintiff presented to Thomas J. Derbes, M.D., with complaints of pain in the low back, leg, and hip, and she returned in August 2003 with complaints pain in the low back (tr. 326). Dr. Derbes subsequently administered lumbar epidural steroid injections ("ESIs") at L5 on the left and bilateral lumbar facet joint injections at L4-5 and L5-S1 (tr. 324-25, 414).
Plaintiff began seeing David Evans, M.D., a pain management physician, on September 23, 2004 (tr. 285, 493, 495). She complained of low back pain, left leg pain, and bilateral hip pain as a result of her work-related injury (tr. 497). Following a physical examination that revealed some relatively minor abnormalities (see tr. 503-04), Dr. Evans prescribed medications, advised Plaintiff to quit smoking (she was then smoking more than one pack of cigarettes per day (doc. 499)), and suggested that Plaintiff return in four weeks (tr. 505). Plaintiff followed up in October and November 2004, and Dr. Evans' treatment notes are essentially the same, although—following the November visit—Dr. Evans advised Plaintiff to return in ten weeks (tr. 490-92 493-94). Plaintiff, however, returned in mid-December following a "slip and fall" incident (tr. 488). Dr. Evans continued Plaintiff on her medications, after noting Plaintiff's report that the medications decreased her pain, caused no side effects, and improved her quality of life and daily activities (tr. 486). He advised Plaintiff to return in twelve weeks ( id.).
In a letter dated February 24, 2004, Dr. Fitzgerald stated that he agreed with Dr. Alexander's opinions regarding Plaintiff's MMI (that is, that Plaintiff had reached MMI in or about March 2003) and whole person permanent impairment rating (that is, 6%) as to her work-related injury (tr. 381; see also tr. 311). He also stated he had reviewed Plaintiff's MRI results and reiterated his opinion that surgical intervention was unnecessary (see tr. 381). 5 
In June 2004, Plaintiff returned to Dr. Derbes and reported that medication had improved her ability to function and caused no side effects (tr. 361, 363, 407, 411). She also underwent another lumbar MRI in June 2004, which revealed degenerative disc disease at L4-5 and L5-SI, with minimal posterior spondylosis; minimal annular bulging toward the left at L4-5, with minimal bilateral foraminal narrowing and borderline canal narrowing; minimal broad-based annular bulging at L5-S1, more prominent on the right, with mild right and minimal left foraminal narrowing; and minimal facet hypertrophy at L5-S1, without canal stenosis (tr. 400). In July 2004, Plaintiff again reported improved function with the use of medications and [*6] no significant side-effects (tr. 405-06).
On October 23, 2004, Plaintiff underwent a functional capacity evaluation ("FCE") at Dr. Evans' request (tr. 320). Overall, the FCE revealed no significant physical findings. The evaluator (Roy Nash, a licensed occupational therapist) opined that Plaintiff could perform work at sedentary to light exertional levels, and he released Plaintiff to her current work at CH (which, he estimated, involved lifting fifteen to twenty pounds occasionally and ten pounds frequently) (see tr. 320-23).
Plaintiff obtained another MRI of the lumbar spine on January 3, 2005, which revealed mild degenerative disc disease at L1-2, L4-5, and L5-SI, with disc desiccation and slight circumferential disc bulges but no disc protrusion, central canal stenosis, or foraminal narrowing throughout the lumbar spine (tr. 426).
Plaintiff returned to Dr. Evans in June of 2005, at which time he added ESIs to Plaintiff's treatment regimen (tr. 477). When Plaintiff returned in August 2005, she reported that her pain had improved, she described her pain as "mild," and she rated her pain as a two on a ten-point scale ("2/10") (tr. 474). Dr. Evans again advised Plaintiff to cease smoking and, as he had done before, recommended a home exercise program (tr. 475; see also, e.g., tr. 480, 483, 486). Likewise, in October 2005, Plaintiff rated her pain as a 2/10, stated her pain was "better," and noted her pain was relieved with injections and medication management (tr. 471). In November 2005, Plaintiff again reported pain relief with Dr. Evans' treatment regimen, although she rated her pain as a 4/10 (tr. 339). Plaintiff returned on other occasions in 2005 and 2006, and Dr. Evans' records, although partially illegible, generally reflect continued successful pain management with medication and/or lumbar ESIs (see, e.g., tr. 339, 341, 342, 344).
In October 2006, the workers' compensation insurance carrier declined to approve Dr. Evans' request for additional lumbar ESIs, based on its determination that ESIs were not medically necessary due to the lack of any nerve root impingement or central stenosis (tr. 278-83).
After reporting pain in her hands and arms to Dr. Evans, Plaintiff underwent a nerve conduction study and was subsequently diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome ("CTS") in May 2006 (see tr. 457, 455). 6 Plaintiff underwent bilateral carpal tunnel release surgery in December of 2006, after which her symptoms improved "considerably" (see tr. 285).
In or about February 2007, R. Barry, Lurate, M.D., an orthopedist, conducted an independent medical evaluation in connection with Plaintiff's work-related injury (see tr. 285). Dr. Lurate assessed status post carpal tunnel release, doing well; chronic low back pain; obesity; tobacco dependance, resolved; and history of multiple arthralgias, etiology unclear ( id.).
On April 11, 2007, Plaintiff underwent another MRI upon referral by Dr. Evans (tr. 292). The MRI revealed multilevel spondylosis, but no evidence of a herniated disc, central canal stenosis, or neural foraminal compromise (tr. 293). On May 14, 2007, Plaintiff—who had last seen Dr. Alexander in January 2003—returned to see him [*7] with complaints of low back pain and bilateral leg pain (tr. 433). Dr. Alexander examined Plaintiff, reviewed her MRIs, and diagnosed history of two prior injuries ( id.). He continued to opine that Plaintiff had a 6% whole person permanent rating and that she had reached MMI as of April 1, 2003, for the November 2002 work injury ( id.). He also noted that Plaintiff's condition had not changed significantly since he last saw her, and he recommended that Plaintiff continue treatment with Dr. Evans—which treatment included ESIs and medications—and noted that the treatment seemed to be working and keeping her productive (tr. 434). Finally, Dr. Alexander opined that Plaintiff's work status remained "full duty in regard to her usual occupation," that is, "working in medical records at Covenant Hospice" ( id.).
Lumbar imaging obtained on June 1, 2007, revealed minor lower lumbar spondylosis and facet degenerative changes at L5-S1 (tr. 312).
Plaintiff returned to Dr. Evans in July 2007 (tr. 348). She reported that the "epidurals and medical management" had decreased her pain, improved her quality of life, improved her activities of daily living, and caused no side effects (tr. 348, 351). A physical examination was essentially normal (see tr. 350-51).
On September 26, 2007, W.R. McArthur, M.D., an orthopedist, examined Plaintiff in connection with her work-related injury, after reviewing records and deposition testimony from various treating and examining sources (see tr. 284). Dr. McArthur noted that Plaintiff was wearing a cast brace on her left foot from a recent surgery and that her gait was slightly antalgic "but basically normal" (tr. 286). She displayed tenderness in the lower lumbar area and buttocks, although she could fully flex, extend, and touch the floor with her hands ( id.). She also had full range of motion of the cervical spine with no tenderness ( id.). Examination of the upper extremities, including Plaintiff's hands, yielded normal results, and examination of the lower extremities revealed full range of motion of the hips, although some movements produced low back discomfort ( id.). Straight leg raising tests ("SLRs") were negative ( id.). Dr. McArthur assessed bilateral CTS with good surgical results; chronic low back syndrome, probably secondary to lumbar spondylosis; minimal obesity; and chronic tobacco use (although Dr. Lurate assessed "tobacco dependence, resolved" in early 2007, Plaintiff reported to Dr. McArthur that she smoked one-half to one pack of cigarettes each day, which likely explains the different diagnoses) (see tr. 286)) (tr. 287).
Plaintiff received treatment in 2007 (and thereafter) from Mark Akerson, M.D., a family physician with Panhandle Family Care. His records reflect diagnoses of acute bronchitis, anxiety, shoulder pain, hypersomnia, sleeping difficulty, weakness, acute sinusitis, allergic rhinitis and cellulitis (see, e.g., tr. 547, 548, 549, 554, 704, 743).
On October 22, 2007, Plaintiff underwent a second FCE at Dr. Evans' request (tr. 763). Overall, the FCE revealed no significant physical findings, and the evaluator opined that Plaintiff could perform work at sedentary [*8] to light exertional levels (see tr. 764).
Plaintiff returned to Dr. Evans in January 2008, with complaints of back pain, leg pain, and numbness and tingling in the legs and feet, worse on the left (tr. 508). A physical examination revealed full strength and normal muscle bulk in the lower extremities, tenderness in the spine, and an antalgic gait (favoring the right) (tr. 510). Dr. Evans—after noting Plaintiff's report that lumbar ESIs "helped her with her ability to perform her activities of daily living, reduced her pain medication requirements, and overall have improved her quality of life"—recommended that Plaintiff undergo additional ESIs (tr. 508). Plaintiff agreed and resumed ESIs on January 10, 2008 ( id.). Additionally, relevant to one of the issues raised by Plaintiff in this appeal, Dr. Evans observed no psychiatric abnormalities (tr. 509). At a follow-up appointment in late January 2008, Plaintiff reported that the ESIs had helped her back and leg pain (tr. 513 (again, no psychiatric abnormalities were present)). Plaintiff returned in February 2008 with complaints of low back pain, and Dr. Evans continued her medications and recommended conservative measures for the pain, such as stretching, using hot moist packs, and undergoing massage therapy (tr. 337-38).
Treating or Examining Physicians/Psychologists (near and after June 2, 2008, the alleged onset date) 
The remainder of Dr. Evans' treatment records from 2008 are in most respects the same as his earlier records and generally reflect continued medication management and the occasional administration of ESIs (see, e.g., tr. 529, 533, 536). Notably, in July 2008 Plaintiff rated her pain as a 2/10 and stated that the ESIs provided two months of pain relief (tr. 538). 7 
On October 18, 2008, Adam Berliner, D.O., conducted a consultative examination related to Plaintiff's complaints of bilateral hip pain and constant low back pain (see tr. 558). His examination revealed normal ranges of motion in all areas tested, including the cervical spine, lumbar spine, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hands (including the thumbs and fingers), hips, knees, and ankles (tr. 557). Plaintiff's spine was somewhat tender to palpation at the lumbosacral junction and mildly tender at the lumbar paraspinals (tr. 560). Additionally, manual muscle testing was full (i.e., 5/5) bilaterally in the upper and lower extremities; sensation was intact to light touch bilaterally; SLRs were negative; and Plaintiff could tandem walk, heel and toe walk, and squat and rise from a squatted position without difficulty or clumsiness ( id.). Finally, a neurological examination revealed that Plaintiff was alert and oriented times four ( id.). Dr. Berliner assessed lumbar spondylosis and bilateral lumbar radiculopathy ( id.).
On November 3, 2008, at the request of the Social Security Administration, Plaintiff underwent a consultative psychological evaluation by George L. Horvat, Ph.D. (tr. 562). Dr. Horvat generally observed that Plaintiff's grooming and hygiene were adequate, and her gait and posture were normal, but her "facial expression was depressed," and her motor activity was [*9] agitated as her legs were constantly bouncing and she had tremors ( id.). Plaintiff stated she had no history of mental health treatment ( id.). She reported experiencing panic attacks one to two times a month, as well as physical problems and constant pain (tr. 562-63). Examination revealed that Plaintiff was alert and oriented times four, her memory and speech flow were normal, and her thought content was appropriate, but her "attention was distractible" and anxiety interfered with her ability to concentrate (tr. 563-64). Her mood and affect were depressed, but she displayed no signs of hallucinations, illogical organization, or below-average intelligence or fund of knowledge ( id.). Further, her abstraction, judgment and decision-making were normal (tr. 564). Dr. Horvat assessed adjustment disorder with depressed mood, anxiety disorder with panic attacks, and pain disorder ( id.). He also assessed a Global Assessment ("GAF") score of 65 (tr. 564). 8 Dr. Horvat opined that if Plaintiff was physically able to work, there were no psychological reasons she could not work (tr. 564).
On April 6, 2009, Plaintiff underwent an evaluation by psychiatrist John Laubenthal, M.D., in connection with her workers' compensation claim or, more specifically, an evaluation of her reported depression and its possible relation to her on-the-job injury (tr. 759). Dr. Laubenthal noted he had reviewed numerous records, including records from Drs. Rohan, Fitzgerald, Evans and Akerson, as well as multiple MRI reports ( id.). He then interviewed Plaintiff. She reported some depression but denied experiencing hallucinations, delusions, or symptoms of mania or hypomania, although she endorsed some symptoms consistent with attention deficit disorder ("ADD") or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ("ADHD") (tr. 760-61). Plaintiff also endorsed numerous symptoms of depression, including difficulty falling asleep, decreased appetite, weight gain, limited interest, tearful episodes, feelings of hopelessness and helplessness, and suicidal ideation with no intent, which prompted Dr. Laubenthal to conclude that Plaintiff had "at least a moderate to significant degree of depression" (tr. 760). Additionally, Plaintiff described fleeting suicidal thoughts but no intent or plan (tr. 761). Dr. Laubenthal described Plaintiff's mood as depressed and noted that her affect was generally reactive but somewhat blunted and dysphoric ( id.). He also observed that Plaintiff's attention, memory and concentration were grossly intact; her thought processes were goal directed; and she displayed no evidence of a formal thought disorder or cognitive dysfunction ( id.). In relevant part, Dr. Laubenthal assessed mood disorder with depressive features secondary to chronic pain and related disability; anxiety disorder due to chronic pain and related disability; possibility of ADD or ADHD, unrelated to her work injury; chronic lower back, hip and lower extremity pain; and history of sleep apnea, untreated ( id.). He also assessed a GAF score of 60-70 ( id.). 9 
On May 7, 2009, Dr. Akerson completed forms titled Sedentary Requirements [*10] Checklist ("SRC"), Clinical Assessment of Pain ("CAP"), and Absences From Work ("AFW") (tr. 754-57). On the SRC, which lists a series of "yes or no" questions, he opined that Plaintiff could lift five pounds on a repetitive basis and walk short distances, but she could not perform any other work activity listed on the form (that is, according to Dr. Akerson's "no" answers, she could not utilize both hands in the performance of fine manipulation, sustain activity at a pace and with the attention to task as would be required in the competitive workplace, lift and carry ten pounds, sit up to six hours in a normal position, stand up to two hours in an eight-hour workday, or attend any employment for eight hours a day, five days a week) (tr. 754). On the CAP, which contains three questions and offers four preprinted possible answers for each question, Dr. Akerson indicated: (1) in response to the first question, that Plaintiff's pain "is present to such an extent as to be distracting to adequate performance of daily activities or work" (answer "C"); (2) in response to the second question, that physical activity such as walking, standing, bending, stooping or moving her extremities, would increase her pain "to such an extent that bed rest and/or medication [would be] necessary" (answer "D"); and (3) in response to the third question, that "drug side effects can be expected to be severe and to limit effectiveness . . ." (answer "C") (tr. 755-56). On the AFW, Dr. Akerson selected an answer indicating that Plaintiff would miss work "about three times a month" due to her impairments or related treatment, and he identified the impairments to which he referred as "chronic fatigue" and "lumbar disk disease" (tr. 757) (emphasis added). On December 1, 2009, Dr. Akerson completed another set of the forms (tr. 688-91). He selected the same answers on the SRC (compare tr. 688 with tr. 628). On the CAP, he selected the same answers to the first and third questions, but he lessened the impact of physical activities on Plaintiff's pain by selecting answer "C" in response to the second question and indicating that physical activity will increase Plaintiff's "pain to such a degree as to cause distraction from task or total abandonment of task" (he previously selected option "D," which states Plaintiff would need bed rest due to pain) (tr. 689). And on the AFW, Dr. Akerson selected an option indicating that Plaintiff would miss work more than three times a month (see tr. 690). Dr. Akerson completed a third set of the forms on July 7, 2010. He reached the same conclusions as before on the SRC, with two exceptions: he now opined that Plaintiff could utilize both hands for fine manipulation (he previously opined she could not), and he opined that Plaintiff could not lift five pounds on a repetitive basis (he previously opined she could) (see tr. 749). On the CAP, Dr. Akerson selected option "D" in response to all three questions, thereby indicating—essentially—that Plaintiff is precluded from all work due to pain (see tr. 750-51). Finally, on the AFW, he opined that Plaintiff would miss more than three days of work a month (tr. 752).
Plaintiff continued seeing Dr. Evans in 2009, during which ([*11] 1) her treatment regimen remained essentially the same (e.g., ESIs, medications) (see, e.g., tr. 593-600, 631, 635, 638); (2) the regimen continued to reasonably control Plaintiff's symptoms with no adverse side effects (see, e.g., tr. 631 (post-ESI pain rated as 2/10), tr. 640 (post-ESI pain rates as 0/10), tr. 642 (treatment noted to improve Plaintiff's quality of life and increase ability to perform daily activities), tr. 653 (pain described as "mild" and rated as a 3/10), tr. 657 (no adverse side effects) 10); and (3) her physical examinations yielded essentially the same, unremarkable results as before (see, e.g., tr. 598, 643, 655-56). Likewise, Dr. Evans' observations as to Plaintiff's mental/psychiatric status remained essentially the same (see, e.g., tr. 598, 635, 643, 655-57), although in June, July and September 2009 he did note depressive symptoms, Plaintiff's report of increasing depression, and/or Plaintiff's request for a referral to a psychologist or psychiatrist (tr. 632, 634, 642, 649).
Also in 2009, Plaintiff underwent an evaluation by psychiatrist Ann McDowell, M.D., in connection with her workers' compensation claim (tr. 677). Plaintiff presented on June 23, 2009, with complaints of depression and stated she was "bothered" because she had been fired and was having financial problems; she also stated that her live-in boyfriend had been fired that morning and his firing was causing additional stress ( id.). Plaintiff reported decreased "frustration tolerance, energy and concentration" and stated she felt guilty, worthless, hopeless, and helpless ( id.). Plaintiff further stated she had no medical problems other than pain, which was eased "for a while" with ESIs ( id.). Plaintiff reported smoking up to two packs of cigarettes per day and, with regard to daily activities, she noted that she "loved" yard work, plants, and flowers (tr. 677-78, 684). She also stated that her "daytime activities" during the week included picking up and babysitting her nieces, aged thirteen and nine (tr. 686). Dr. McDowell's examination revealed that Plaintiff was alert and oriented times four, her articulation and judgment were fair, her fund knowledge was good, and her rate of thinking and content of thoughts were normal (tr. 678). She could perform abstract reasoning "fairly well" and computation in a normal manner ( id.). Plaintiff had no loose associations, suicidal or homicidal ideation, obsessions, phobias or delusions, and her immediate, recent and remote memory were intact ( id.). Plaintiff described her mood as depressed, and Dr. McDowell noted that Plaintiff's affect was sad ( id.). Dr. McDowell diagnosed major depressive disorder, recurrent, moderate and hypersomnia with sleep apnea, unspecified, with severe excessive daytime somnolence (see tr. 678, 16). Dr. McDowell noted that Plaintiff was already taking Pristiq 50 mg, which she increased to 100 mg, and she advised Plaintiff to return in three weeks (tr. 678).
Plaintiff returned to Dr. McDowell on three additional occasions in 2009 (in July, September and October) (see tr. 671, 665, 659, respectively). In July, Plaintiff reported that her functioning and "nerves" were better with the medication; she [*12] also noted she tolerated the medication "well" (tr. 672, 674). Plaintiff reported some generalized anxiety but no panic attacks (tr. 672). Dr. McDowell assessed the same diagnoses and made no changes to Plaintiff's medication (tr. 673). In September Plaintiff reported that some symptoms were worse than before (see, e.g., tr. 665-66), but she reported no generalized anxiety and no panic attacks (tr. 666). Dr. McDowell continued to prescribe Pristiq 100 mg, assessed the same diagnoses, and advised Plaintiff that she need not return for six weeks (tr. 668). The October 2009 treatment notes are basically the same (see tr. 659-63).
Plaintiff occasionally returned to Dr. Evans in 2010. His treatment notes are essentially the same as before (see tr. 693-697). One note, from March of 2010, reflects Plaintiff's report that she was satisfied with her treatment plan and desired no change (tr. 697).
Plaintiff returned to Dr. McDowell four times in 2010. Plaintiff reported no panic attacks (tr. 730, 724, 718, 712). Additionally, Plaintiff's medication (i.e., Pristiq 100mg) and psychiatric diagnoses remained the same (see tr. 731-32 (January); tr. 725-26 (February); tr. 719-20 (March); tr. 713-14 (May)), although—based on Plaintiff's report of pain—Dr. McDowell added a medical diagnosis of chronic pain (see, e.g., tr. 714). In May 2010, Plaintiff told Dr. McDowell that she had twin, four-year-old grandchildren that she cared for but that she "didn't do much else" (tr. 712). Following the May 2010 visit, Dr. McDowell advised Plaintiff to return in three months (tr. 714).
On July 6, 2010, Dr. McDowell completed a Mental Medical Source Statement as to Plaintiff's mental RFC, as well as an AFW (tr. 735-37). In relevant part, Dr. McDowell opined that Plaintiff had moderate restrictions in activities of daily living; marked difficulties in maintaining social functioning; marked difficulties in maintaining concentration, persistence, or pace; and three episodes of decompensation, "each of extended duration, which cause exacerbation in symptoms or signs that would ordinarily require increased treatment or a less stressful situation, with an average of 3 episodes in a year or 1 every 4 months, lasting for two weeks" (tr. 735-36). Dr. McDowell also opined that—on or after June 23, 2009—Plaintiff had moderate or marked functional limitations in her ability to perform certain work-related duties, such as understanding instructions, responding appropriately to supervisors and co-workers or customary work pressures, and performing simple or repetitive tasks (tr. 736-37). On the AFW Dr. McDowell opined that Plaintiff would be expected to be absent from work as a result of her impairments or related treatment more than three times per month, and she explained that the impairments to which she referred were Plaintiff's physical impairments (see tr. 738). Finally, she noted that Plaintiff denied any medication side effects (tr. 737).
Non-Examining Physicians/Psychologists/Experts 
On November 6, 2008, David Guttman, M.D., evaluated Plaintiff's physical capacities and opined that Plaintiff could perform work at a medium level of exertion (see tr. 566-[*13] 73; see also 20 C.F.R. § 404.1567(c) ). He noted that Plaintiff's "benign" physical examinations were inconsistent with, or did not fully support, her subjective complaints (see tr. 571).
On December 2, 2008, Thomas Conger, Ph.D., completed a Psychiatric Review Technique form ("PRTF") (tr. 574-87). He evaluated Plaintiff's psychiatric condition under Section (or "Listing") 12.04 of 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1 (Affective Disorders) (tr. 574). Dr. Conger opined that Plaintiff's condition—adjustment disorder with mixed emotional features—did not satisfy the diagnostic criteria of Listing 12.04 (tr. 577, 585). He also opined that as a result of Plaintiff's disorder, she would have no restrictions in activities of daily living; mild difficulties in maintaining social functioning; mild difficulties in maintaining concentration, persistence or pace; and no episodes of deterioration or decompensation (tr. 584). In summary, Dr. Conger stated:
[Plaintiff] is limited by her physical condition and pain to some extent but she acknowledges the mental ability to perform a wide range of [activities of daily living] within her physical restrictions. Although she may experience some depression and/or anxiety at times, she remains fully functional from a mental perspective. She is able to relate in a socially appropriate manner and also displays an overall adequate Mental Status. Based on the totality of evidence, she appears to be primarily limited by her physical difficulties and there is no indication of a severe mental impairment at this time.
(tr. 586).

On March 4, 2009, John A. Dawson, M.D., evaluated Plaintiff's physical capacities and opined that Plaintiff could perform work at a light level of exertion (see tr. 601-08; see also 20 C.F.R. § 404.1567(b) ). As did Dr. Guttman, Dr. Dawson concluded that Plaintiff's subjective complaints are not fully credible, noting in part that the complaints are inconsistent with the results of Plaintiff's MRIs and physical examinations (see tr. 602-03, 606).
On March 17, 2009, James L. Meyers, Psy.D., completed a PRTF (tr. 609-22). He evaluated Plaintiff's psychiatric conditions under Listing 12.04 and Listing 12.06 (Anxiety-Related Disorders) (tr. 609). Dr. Meyers opined that Plaintiff's conditions—adjustment disorder with depressed mood and anxiety disorder with panic attacks—did not satisfy the diagnostic criteria of either listing (tr. 612, 614, 620). He also opined that as a result of Plaintiff's disorders, she would have the same restrictions as those imposed by Dr. Conger, with one exception, that is, that she would have mild restrictions in activities of daily living (as opposed to none) (tr. 619).
Testimony of Anthony Francis, M.D. 
At Plaintiff's hearing, the ALJ solicited testimony from Dr. Francis, an orthopedist and medical expert (see tr. 28-29). Dr. Francis first noted he had reviewed Plaintiff's file and indicated that his testimony would focus on those records that postdate Plaintiff's alleged disability onset date (tr. 30). In pertinent part, Dr. Francis testified that Dr. Berliner's examination in October 2008 "showed no physical findings" ( id.). He also discussed the RFC assessments of Dr. Guttman [*14] and Dr. Dawson, which reflect that Plaintiff could perform work at medium or light levels of exertion, and the opinions rendered by Dr. Akerson on the SRCs, CAPs, and AFWs; he also noted the lack of any MRIs during the time frame relevant to this appeal (see tr. 30-31, 34-35). Dr. Francis then testified that Dr. Akerson's opinions on the SRCs, CAPs, and AFWs are inconsistent with his treatment records and that Dr. Akerson "offer[ed] no rationale or explanation" for the opinions (tr. 37-38). Dr. Francis also opined that the most recent MRI revealed "fairly minimal" findings, and that the physical findings of record, including "normal neurological findings in the lower extremities," do not support the diagnosis of radiculopathy and thus the diagnosis was likely based on Plaintiff's subjective complaints (tr. 31-32, 36, 40). Dr. Francis explained that normally a diagnosis of radiculopathy is based upon positive SLRs, decreased sensation to pin prick, loss of muscle strength and reflex, and/or other factors that do not appear in Plaintiff's records (tr. 36-37, 40-41). He further opined that Plaintiff's conditions do not meet or equal the criteria of a listed impairment and that objective testing showed that Plaintiff's CTS was mild (tr. 40-41). Finally, Dr. Francis testified that he concurred with the opinions of Dr. Dawson, which equate to finding that Plaintiff is capable of performing work at a light exertional level, with only one exception, namely, that Plaintiff should be restricted from working at unprotected heights ( id.).
V. DISCUSSION
Plaintiff raises numerous issues in this appeal, some of which overlap and some of which are confusing. The issues appear to be the following. The ALJ erred: (1) by failing to accord proper weight—or properly discount—the opinions of Dr. Akerson, Dr. Evans, and Dr. McDowell (doc. 20 at 20-27); (2) in determining Plaintiff's RFC ( id. at 27-33); (3) in concluding at step four that Plaintiff could return to her job as an administrative assistant and in concluding, alternatively at step five, that she could perform other available work ( id. at 27-32); and (4) in evaluating Plaintiff's subjective complaints of pain and other symptoms ( id. at 33-35). 11 The Commissioner contends the ALJ properly evaluated the opinions of Plaintiff's physicians, as well as her subjective complaints, and properly determined her RFC (see doc. 23). He also generally contends that the ALJ considered Plaintiff's claim for DIB in accordance with applicable statutes and regulations, and further, that his final decision denying Plaintiff's claim is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole and should be affirmed ( id.).
A. Opinions of Plaintiff's Treating Physicians
Substantial weight must be given to the opinion, diagnosis and medical evidence of a treating physician unless there is good cause to do otherwise. See Lewis, 125 F.3d at 1439-41 ; Edwards v. Sullivan, 937 F.2d 580 , 583 (11th Cir. 1991); Sabo v. Chater, 955 F. Supp. 1456 , 1462 (M.D. Fla. 1996); 20 C.F.R. § 404.1527(d) . "'[G]ood cause' exists when the: (1) treating physician's opinion was not bolstered by the evidence; (2) evidence supported a contrary finding; or (3) treating physician's opinion was conclusory or inconsistent [*15] with the doctor's own medical records." Phillips v. Barnhart, 357 F.3d 1232 , 1240-41 (11th Cir. 2004) (citation omitted). The ALJ may discount a treating physician's opinion or report regarding an inability to work if it is unsupported by objective medical evidence or is wholly conclusory. See Edwards, 937 F.2d 580 (finding that the ALJ properly discounted treating physician's report where the physician was unsure of the accuracy of his findings and statements).
However, if a treating physician's opinion on the nature and severity of a claimant's impairments is well supported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques, and is not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in the record, the ALJ must give it controlling weight. 20 C.F.R. § 404.1527(d)(2) .
When a treating physician's opinion does not warrant controlling weight, the ALJ must nevertheless weigh the medical opinion based on: (1) the length of the treatment relationship and the frequency of examination; (2) the nature and extent of the treatment relationship; (3) medical evidence supporting the opinion; (4) consistency with the record as a whole; (5) specialization in the medical issues at issue; and (6) other factors which tend to support or contradict the opinion. 20 C.F.R. § 404.1527(d) . Generally, a treating physician's opinion is entitled to more weight than a consulting physician's opinion. See Wilson v. Heckler, 734 F.2d 513 , 518 (11th Cir. 1984); see also 20 C.F.R. § 404.1527(d)(2) .
The ALJ is required to review all of the medical findings and other evidence that support a medical source's statement that a claimant is disabled. However, the ALJ is responsible for making the ultimate determination about whether a claimant meets the statutory definition of disability. 20 C.F.R. § 404.1527(e) . The ALJ is not required to give any special significance to the status of a physician as treating or non-treating in weighing an opinion on whether Plaintiff meets a listed impairment, a claimant's RFC (see 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1545 , 404.1546), or the application of vocational factors, because those ultimate determinations are the province of the Commissioner. 20 C.F.R. § 404.1527(e) .
Dr. Akerson 
As discussed in detail supra, Dr. Akerson filled out SRCs, CAPs, and AFWs, on which he selected preprinted answers to various questions regarding Plaintiff's functional abilities, pain, and expected absences from work. The ALJ gave little weight to his selections on these forms (tr. 18). The ALJ explained that although Dr. Akerson is a treating physician, he is a family physician who mainly treated Plaintiff for a variety of "routine illnesses"—such as bronchitis, sleeping difficulties, sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, and cellulitis—not for her lumbar condition, yet he based his disabling opinions on her lumbar condition and pain (see tr. 16-17). The ALJ's explanation is accurate, as Plaintiff admitted during her testimony that Dr. Akerson did not treat her for her back, and Dr. Akerson indicated that his opinions were largely based on Plaintiff's lumbar condition or related pain (tr. 20, 56-57; see also, e.g., tr. 752, 757). 12 Moreover, the record reflects that numerous orthopedists saw Plaintiff for her back, including Dr. Rohan, Dr. Alexander, Dr. Lurate and Dr. McArthur, as well [*16] as a neurosurgeon, Dr. Fitzgerald and, further, that none of these specialists opined that Plaintiff suffered from a disabling lumbar condition or pain, as did Dr. Akerson. To the contrary, together these specialists treated or examined Plaintiff, reviewed her lumbar MRIs and thereafter declined to recommend surgery or aggressive treatment, conducted essentially normal or minimally abnormal physical examinations, and/or cleared Plaintiff for work.
Although the specialists' treatment and examinations occurred prior to June 2, 2008, the date Plaintiff alleges she became disabled, their records and opinions are nevertheless relevant to the claims Plaintiff raises in this appeal, as explained next. Plaintiff underwent at least five lumbar MRIs prior to June 2008, the last of which she obtained in April 2007. In May 2007, Dr. Alexander reviewed the April 2007 MRI, as well as Plaintiff's earlier MRIs, and he specifically noted that Plaintiff's condition had not changed significantly since January of 2003; he also stated that Plaintiff's work status remained "full duty." See 20 C.F.R. § 404.1527(d)(5) ("more weight [is given] to the opinion of a specialist about medical issues related to his or her area of specialty than to the opinion of a source who is not a specialist."). Although Dr. Alexander's opinions were offered approximately one year prior to Plaintiff's alleged onset date, his opinions nevertheless undermine Dr. Akerson's opinions because there is no evidence showing that Plaintiff's lumbar condition worsened thereafter, including during the time she was under Dr. Akerson's care (i.e., from 2007, forward). To illustrate, Plaintiff obtained no lumbar MRIs or other diagnostic imaging after Dr. Alexander offered his opinions in May 2007; thus, there exists no objective evidence documenting a worsening of Plaintiff's condition. Likewise, Plaintiff obtained no treatment from an orthopedist, neurosurgeon, or other specialist during the time frame relevant to this appeal, as might be expected had her back condition worsened or in any way resulted in the extreme pain and limitations indicated by Dr. Akerson on the forms. Furthermore, no physician opined at any time—much less during the relevant period—that Plaintiff's condition required surgical intervention or a more aggressive course of treatment, and no physician referred Plaintiff to an orthopedist or similar specialist during the relevant period. Rather, during the relevant period Plaintiff mainly obtained treatment from Dr. Evans for pain related to her lumbar condition, and the record reflects that his treatment regimen was successful.
In further discounting Dr. Akerson's conclusory opinions, the ALJ noted that his "own treatment notes" fail to substantiate his opinions (tr. 16, 18). Similarly, the ALJ noted, Dr. Akerson documented no significant "clinical [or] laboratory" abnormalities consistent with the disabling limitations he later imposed (tr. 16). The ALJ's additional reasoning is well-founded and supported by the record. The undersigned has not located—and Plaintiff has [*17] not identified—any treatment records from Dr. Akerson that support the opinions at issue here. Indeed, Dr. Francis made the same observation, that is, that Dr. Akerson's treatment notes fail to support his opinions on the SRCs, CAPs, and AFWs. Moreover, Plaintiff admits that "Dr. Akerson's records are somewhat sparse" (doc. 20 at 25). Plaintiff asserts, however, that Dr. Akerson and Dr. Evans coordinated her care, and that Dr. Evans shared his treatment notes with Dr. Akerson; therefore, Plaintiff apparently contends, Dr. Akerson's opinions are based on more than merely his own treatment of Plaintiff, so it matters not that Dr. Akerson's treatment records fail to support his opinions (see id. (citing tr. 759)). This argument misses the mark. If Dr. Akerson had been privy to all of Dr. Evans' treatment notes and/or coordinated Plaintiff's care with Dr. Evans, his opinions on the forms are even more inconsistent with the treatment records of which he was aware (i.e., his and Dr. Evans'). As previously noted, and as also noted by the ALJ in discounting Dr. Akerson's opinions, Dr. Evans' records—which include Plaintiff's own reports of only mild to minimal pain and repeatedly reflect successful management of Plaintiff's pain—are wholly inconsistent with Dr. Akerson's opinions (see tr. 16-18). 13 Furthermore, regardless of any coordinated care between Dr. Akerson and Dr. Evans, Dr. Akerson remains a family physician who only tangentially treated Plaintiff for her back, did not refer her to a specialist, did not order or review additional MRIs, and did not recommend a different or more aggressive form of treatment, some or all of which actions would be expected if Plaintiff was as limited as Dr. Akerson opined.
Finally, preprinted forms, such as those completed by Dr. Akerson, do not provide persuasive evidence of the validity of the opinions expressed therein, as the ALJ intimated here and as other courts have found. See, e.g., Hammersley v. Astrue, No. 5:08cv245-Oc-10GRJ, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92697 , 2009 WL 3053707 , at *6 (M.D. Fla. Sept. 18, 2009) ("check-off forms . . . have limited probative value because they are conclusory and provide little narrative or insight into the reasons behind the conclusions") (citing Spencer ex rel. Spencer v. Heckler, 765 F.2d 1090 , 1094 (11th Cir. 1985) (rejecting opinion from a non-examining physician who merely checked boxes on a form without providing any explanation for his conclusions); Mason v. Shalala, 994 F.2d 1058 , 1065 (3d Cir. 1993) (noting that "[f]orm reports in which a physician's obligation is only to check a box or fill in a blank are weak evidence at best.")). For all of these reasons, the ALJ did not err in rejecting Dr. Akerson's opinions. 14 
Dr. Evans 
Plaintiff alleges the ALJ erred in his consideration of Dr. Evans' records (doc. 20 at 20, 23). More specifically, Plaintiff contends that "Dr. Evans' records, and the diagnoses he assigned, should have been given substantial—if not controlling—weight, and the ALJ's failure to even address these issues (let alone show good cause for failing to accept this treating source material) mandates reversal for an award of benefits" (doc. 20 at 23, 26). While her argument is somewhat unclear, Plaintiff appears to assert that the ALJ [*18] had an obligation to state "what, if any, weight [he gave to Dr. Evans'] treating source records" and diagnoses—not just his diagnosis of lumbar spondylosis, an impairment the ALJ found severe—and that the ALJ's failure to do so "in and of itself warrants reversal for an award of benefits" (see doc. 20 at 24 (emphasis added) & 26-27).
Initially, Plaintiff does not appear to contend that the ALJ erred at step two in failing to find any additional impairments severe, whether diagnosed by Dr. Evans or another physician (see doc. 20 at 20-24). Even if Plaintiff has raised such a contention, diagnoses alone are insufficient to establish severity at step two. See, e.g., Salles v. Comm'r. of Social Security, 229 F. App'x 140 , 145 (3d Cir. 2007). Plaintiff must present evidence demonstrating that the conditions significantly limited her ability to do basic work activities. See 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520(c) , 404.1521(a); see also Salles, 229 F. App'x at 145 . Plaintiff has failed to do so, as she has merely recited Dr. Evans' additional, lumbar-related diagnoses, and the court has found no evidence demonstrating that any other diagnosed condition caused significant limitations (see doc. 20 at 24). Thus, to the extent Plaintiff has alleged error at step two, she is not entitled to relief.
Next, Plaintiff appears to contend that the ALJ was required to state the weight he assigned to Dr. Evans' records and diagnoses, but Plaintiff is mistaken. Had Dr. Evans offered an opinion as to Plaintiff's functional capacities or pain the ALJ would likely have erred by failing to state the weight he accorded it, but Dr. Evans did not offer any such opinion. Likewise, had the ALJ ignored Dr. Evans' treatment records he would likely have erred, but the ALJ did not ignore his records or diagnoses. The ALJ thoroughly summarized Dr. Evans' records and diagnoses, including the diagnoses Plaintiff suggests he seemingly ignored, such as radiculitis, sacroilitis, degenerative lumbosacral disc, and spinal stenosis of the lumbar region (compare tr. 14 with doc. 20 at 24; see also tr. 15-17, 20-21 (ALJ's continued discussion of Dr. Evans' records)). The ALJ's extensive discussion of the evidence in this case, including Dr. Evans' records, demonstrates that he complied with his obligation to consider Plaintiff's "medical condition as a whole." Dyer v. Barnhart, 395 F.3d 1206 , 1211 (11th Cir. 2005). An ALJ need not specifically state the weight assigned to records or diagnoses, especially where—as here—the ALJ did not overlook the records or reject an opinion or even a diagnosis of Dr. Evans (the ALJ specifically noted that Dr. Evans did not assess Plaintiff's capacities or pain (see tr. 17-18) 15).
Aware that Dr. Evans did not assess her capacities or pain (see doc. 20 at 18-19), Plaintiff contends the ALJ had an obligation to consider three notations in Dr. Evans' records stating that Plaintiff's pain behaviors are "within the expected context of disease" and two notations describing Plaintiff's pain as "severe" (doc. 20 at 24 (citing tr. 509, 515, 528, and tr. 519, 538, respectively)). Plaintiff's contention is unpersuasive. First, "there is no rigid requirement that the ALJ specifically refer to every piece of evidence in his decision," as long [*19] as the decision "is not a broad rejection which is 'not enough to enable [the district court or this Court] to conclude that [the ALJ] considered her medical condition as a whole.'" Dyer, 395 F.3d at 1211 (quoting Foote, 67 F.3d at 1561 ). It is clear in this case that ALJ considered the record and Plaintiff's medical condition as a whole. Second, the notations identified by Plaintiff do not undermine the ALJ's findings. The first notation was made on January 10, 2008, when Dr. Evans reported that Plaintiff's last ESI was more than four months prior (tr. 508-09). Noting that the ESIs "helped with [Plaintiff's] ability to perform her activities of daily living, reduce her pain medication requirements, and overall have improved her quality of life"—and that Plaintiff's pain had worsened recently without them—Dr. Evans administered an ESI that day and recommended a future course of ESIs (tr. 508). When Plaintiff returned two weeks later, on January 24, 2008—the same day the second notation identified by Plaintiff was made (see tr. 515)—Plaintiff rated her pain as a 3/10 and stated that her current treatment regimen "improved activity, decreased pain, improved quality of life, [and caused] no side effects" (tr. 512, 517). The third notation identified by Plaintiff was made on April 22, 2008 (tr. 528), the same day Plaintiff told Dr. Evans she had recently fallen and landed on her sacrum (tr. 526), which evidently resulted in a temporary exacerbation of her pain (Plaintiff received an ESI approximately one week later, on May 1, 2008, and when she returned for follow-up on July 9, 2008, she rated her pain as a 2/10 and stated she was satisfied with her "current care plan" and desired no change (tr. 535, 538, 541)). Similarly, the notations of "severe" pain identified by Plaintiff essentially reflect occasional exacerbations in Plaintiff's pain, which subsided with Dr. Evans' usual course of care (see, e.g., tr. 519 (notation of severe pain made after Plaintiff reported falling)). The ALJ had no obligation to mention each notation identified by Plaintiff, as he acknowledged that Plaintiff reported fluctuating levels of pain to Dr. Evans (see, e.g., tr. 16-18) but correctly observed that overall Dr. Evans' treatment regimen successfully controlled Plaintiff's pain. As the ALJ stated—with support in the record—Plaintiff's "own statements to Dr. Evans routinely note that her injective therapy was quite effective in reducing her overall pain" (tr. 17). Based on the foregoing discussion, the undersigned finds no error in the ALJ's consideration of Dr. Evans' records.
Dr. McDowell 
Plaintiff presented to Dr. McDowell in late June 2009, more than one year after the date she alleges she became disabled. She returned to Dr. McDowell three times in 2009 and four times in 2010. In July 2010 Dr. McDowell assessed Plaintiff's mental RFC and completed an AFW, as previously discussed. The ALJ considered Dr. McDowell's opinions on these forms and accorded them little weight (tr. 17). The ALJ noted that Dr. McDowell was a treating physician but found that her treatment notes did not support her opinions ( id.). The ALJ's finding is supported by the record.
Although Dr. McDowell'[*20] s treatment notes reflect that Plaintiff's affect was sad or her mood depressed, Dr. McDowell's mental status examinations are inconsistent with the extreme limitations she later assessed. The examinations generally revealed that Plaintiff was alert and oriented times four and displayed normal, "fair," or "good" articulation, judgment, fund of knowledge, rate of thinking, thought content, recent memory, remote memory, abstract reasoning, and computation (see tr. 678; see also tr. 16-17). Additionally, Dr. McDowell observed no loose associations, obsessions, phobias, delusions, or suicidal or homicidal ideations (tr. 678; see also tr. 16). Thus, Dr. McDowell's examinations and observations are inconsistent with, for example, her opinions on the RFC assessment that Plaintiff has "marked" limitations in maintaining concentration, persistence or pace; performing simple tasks; and understanding, remembering and carrying out instructions (see tr. 736). Dr. McDowell's treatment records likewise provide no support for her opinion that Plaintiff experiences three episodes of decompensation, each of extended duration (i.e., two to three weeks), approximately once every four months. To be sure, Dr. McDowell's records contain no notes reflecting that Plaintiff reported any such episode to her, and there is no indication in her records (or elsewhere in the record) that Plaintiff required hospitalization or intensive therapy as would be expected during the course of one or more of these repeated and lengthy episodes of decompensation. Furthermore, if Plaintiff's mental condition was as debilitating as Dr. McDowell's opinions suggest, Dr. McDowell would likely have altered Plaintiff's medications (as the ALJ noted (tr. 17)), directed that Plaintiff return to see her on a more frequent basis, or recommended more intensive treatment, but Dr. McDowell took none of these actions (other than once adjusting Plaintiff's dosage of Pristiq). Moreover, Dr. McDowell saw Plaintiff a total of eight times between June 2009 and May 2010—or, on less than a monthly basis—and at Plaintiff's last visit in May 2010, Dr. McDowell advised Plaintiff that she need not return for three months. This treatment plan and visitation schedule are inconsistent with the type and frequency that would be expected for a person who was as limited as Dr. McDowell opined.
Continuing, the ALJ further discounted Dr. McDowell's opinions as inconsistent with the record as a whole (tr. 17). Again, the ALJ did not err. No other examining or treating physician made notations or observations consistent with Dr. McDowell's disabling opinions. Although Dr. Evans and Dr. Akerson occasionally noted that Plaintiff was anxious or depressed, neither referred Plaintiff to a mental health specialist or observed significantly abnormal behaviors or symptoms during the course of their treatment. To the contrary, Dr. Evans often reported that he observed no psychiatric abnormalities. Perhaps more important, Plaintiff had no history of mental health treatment whatsoever prior to her first office [*21] visit with Dr. McDowell in June 2009 (and this visit was only in connection with her workers' compensation claim). Although Plaintiff was previously examined by Dr. Horvat (in November 2008) and Dr. Laubenthal (in April 2009), these examinations were in connection with Plaintiff's claim for DIB (Horvat) and workers' compensation (Laubenthal), not to seek or initiate mental health treatment. Additionally, as the ALJ noted, Dr. Horvat concluded there was no psychological reason Plaintiff could not work, and he assessed a GAF indicating only mild symptoms (tr. 15, 18). Dr. Laubenthal did not access Plaintiff's capacities, but Plaintiff contends his records are consistent with Dr. McDowell's opinions (see doc. 20 at 26). In support, Plaintiff points to Dr. Laubenthal's observations of Plaintiff's mood and symptoms and to the diagnoses he assessed (doc. 20 at 26). His observations and diagnoses, however, do not alone support the disabling limitations assessed by Dr. McDowell. Moreover, Dr. Laubenthal assessed a GAF that is generally consistent with Dr. Horvat's GAF, as the ALJ noted (tr. 18). Together their GAF scores largely reflect mild symptoms and, correspondingly, undermine Dr. McDowell's opinions (tr. 18). Lastly, Plaintiff had no difficulty understanding, concentrating, or communicating with the ALJ or the Commissioner's employees (see, e.g., tr. 42-67, 187-88), or any of the physicians who treated or examined her, as might be expected if Plaintiff suffered from the severe limitations assessed by Dr. McDowell. Thus, the overall record is indeed inconsistent with Dr. McDowell's opinions, as the ALJ found.
The ALJ also noted that Dr. McDowell appeared to focus on Plaintiff's complaints of pain, as opposed to her mental health or limitations (tr. 21). This finding, too, is supported by the record. For example, although Dr. McDowell opined on the AFW that Plaintiff would miss work more than three times a month as a result of her impairments, she specifically noted that the impairments to which she referred were Plaintiff's inability "to walk, sit or stand for any length of time" (tr. 738). Additionally, some of Dr. McDowell's treatment notes suggest that the primary reason for Plaintiff's visit was pain or that the root of Plaintiff's issues was her back pain (see, e.g., 671, 675, 717, 723).
Finally, the ALJ considered that Dr. McDowell's treatment consisted largely of medication management, as opposed to individual therapy (tr. 21), which suggests that Plaintiff's symptoms were reasonably controlled with medication or, similarly, that Dr. McDowell did not believe Plaintiff needed counseling, therapy, or any other additional or more aggressive form of treatment. Plaintiff argues that this finding—that Dr. McDowell "merely provid[ed] pharmaceutical treatment and not therapy"—is erroneous because Dr. McDowell's treatment notes state, "TREATMENT: Medication evaluation and management; supportive psychotherapy" (doc. 20 at 26 (citing tr. 659, 665, 671)). Again, Plaintiff's assertion is unavailing. The "TREATMENT" notations she references are preprinted captions on forms used by Dr. McDowell, and [*22] in the spaces provided for handwritten notes that follow the captions there is no indication that Plaintiff actually attended psychotherapy sessions (see tr. 659, 665, 671)). It is evident that these are generic forms used in Dr. McDowell's practice and, further, that the handwritten notations on the forms—not the preprinted captions—are unique to each patient and, correspondingly, constitute the best source of information as to the true nature of a particular patient's care. Thus, the ALJ did not err in finding that Dr. McDowell primarily, if not exclusively, treated Plaintiff with medication management as opposed to therapy. In any event, this reason was but one of many offered by the ALJ in discounting Dr. McDowell's opinions, and his other reasons are alone sufficient to uphold his overall findings as to Dr. McDowell. Thus, in conclusion, the undersigned finds that the ALJ's reasons for discounting Dr. McDowell's opinions are supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole, and the reasons were properly considered by the ALJ. Plaintiff, therefore, is not entitled to relief on this claim.
B. ALJ's Residual Functional Capacity Determination, and
C. ALJ's Findings at Steps Four and Five
Plaintiff contends the ALJ erred in determining her RFC, and in support she raises a variety of sub-claims, including the following: (1) the RFC makes no mention of Plaintiff's CTS "with respect to [Plaintiff's] ability to perform fine manipulation"; (2) the RFC fails to account for the accommodations made by CH "to allow her to continue to work after her 2002 on-the-job injury and until she was fired in 2008"; and (3) the RFC is inconsistent with the disabling opinions offered by Drs. Akerson, Evans, and/or McDowell 16 ( see doc. 20 at 27, 29-30). In related claims, Plaintiff also contends—based on a variety of arguments—that the ALJ's findings at steps four and five are erroneous.
Residual functional capacity is an assessment, based upon all of the relevant evidence, of a claimant's remaining ability to do work despite her impairments. See Lewis, 125 F.3d at 1440 . As stated in 20 C.F.R. § 404.1545(a) , it is the most a claimant can still do despite her limitations. "It is the claimant's burden, and not the Social Security Commissioner's burden, to prove the claimant's RFC." Pearsall v. Massanari, 274 F.3d 1211 , 1217 (8th Cir. 2001). Although the RFC determination is a medical question, it is not based only on "medical" evidence, that is, evidence from medical reports or sources; rather, an ALJ has the duty, at step four, to assess RFC on the basis of all the relevant, credible evidence of record. See Phillips v. Barnhart, 357 F.3d 1232 , 1238 (11th Cir. 2004); McKinney v. Apfel, 228 F.3d 860 , 863 (8th Cir. 2000) (the Commissioner must determine a claimant's RFC based on all of the relevant evidence, including the medical records, observations of treating physicians and others, and an individual's own description of her limitations); Dykes v. Apfel, 223 F.3d 865 , 866-67 (8th Cir. 2000) (per curiam) (RFC is a determination based upon all the record evidence, but the record must include some medical evidence that supports the RFC finding). See also 20 C.F.R. § 404.1545 ; Social Security Ruling ("SSR") 96-8p, 1996 SSR LEXIS 5 (eff. July 2, 1996). Additionally, impairments found [*23] non-severe are to be considered in making the RFC determination. 20 C.F.R. § 404.1545(e) . But, even when an ALJ finds severe impairments, it does not necessarily mean there will be functional limitations included in the RFC. See McDaniel v. Bowen, 800 F.2d 1026 , 1031 (11th Cir. 1986) ("Step two is a threshold inquiry. It allows only claims based on the most trivial impairments to be rejected.").
Plaintiff asserts the ALJ erred by failing to include in the RFC restrictions related to her CTS, an impairment he found severe (see tr. 10). Plaintiff, though, has not identified the nature of the limitations she (presumably) contends should have been—but were not—included in the RFC. In support of this claim she points only to Dr. Evans' diagnosis of "severe carpal tunnel syndrome" (see doc. 20 at 30) (emphasis in original). This diagnosis, however, was made well before the date Plaintiff alleges she became disabled and before her successful carpal tunnel release surgery (see footnote 14, supra). Furthermore, although the ALJ found Plaintiff's "mild" CTS to be a severe impairment at step two (tr. 10), which corresponds with a finding that it imposes work-related limitations, Plaintiff did not testify that she has any CTS-related limitations (see tr. 42-67), and no such limitations are apparent from the record other than lifting and carrying restrictions which are included in the RFC and which are supported by the record. Dr. Francis addressed Plaintiff's CTS, and he specifically opined that the CTS would cause no restrictions in Plaintiff's ability to use her hands, reach in all directions, "handle, finger [or] feel," or perform fine or gross manipulation, as long as she did not lift more than twenty pounds occasionally or ten pounds frequently (tr. 40-42). Thus, the RFC does include restrictions related to Plaintiff's CTS, and Plaintiff is not entitled to relief on this claim.
Next, Plaintiff contends the ALJ erred in finding at step four that she could return to her past relevant work because, according to her testimony, she was able to perform this work only because CH made accommodations for her, such as allowing her to alternate positions at will and take unscheduled breaks (Plaintiff appears to make a similar contention as to the ALJ's alternative finding at step five) (see doc. 20 at 27-33). A review of relevant testimony from Plaintiff's hearing is necessary for the resolution of this claim.
Plaintiff testified she could sit or stand at will and take breaks as needed when she worked as an administrative assistant at CH (tr. 45, 64). Robert Strader, a Vocational Expert ("VE"), testified after Plaintiff and noted that prior to the hearing he had reviewed the "vocational aspects" of Plaintiff's file and that he was present for and heard Plaintiff's hearing testimony (tr. 68). He then testified that he did not need any additional information as to Plaintiff's past work in order to offer expert opinions (see tr. 69-70). He proceeded to characterize Plaintiff's original work at CH as a health aide, which was performed at a medium exertional level, and her more recent administrative work at CH as a "general clerk," which is normally performed [*24] at a light exertional level but was performed by Plaintiff between the light and sedentary exertional levels (tr. 70). The ALJ then asked the VE to assume a hypothetical individual with, in pertinent part, Plaintiff's past work experience "who's confined to the performance of a relatively full range of light work as that's defined in the regulations [and] [w]ith only a preclusion from working at unprotected heights," and whether such an individual could perform Plaintiff's past work as a general clerk (tr. 70). The VE responded that such a person could perform Plaintiff's past work as a general clerk and other available work, including work as a ticket taker (light), gate guard (light), hand packer (light), and food and beverage order clerk (sedentary) (see tr. 70-72). The VE further opined that the ticket taker, gate guard, food and beverage clerk, and general office clerk jobs could still be performed even if the requirement of "ability to alternate between sitting and standing" was added to the hypothetical question (tr. 72). The VE noted that the available job base for a ticket taker would likely be reduced with the additional requirement, but any reduction would be offset by the available number of parking lot cashier positions, another light job that the hypothetical individual could perform (with the requirement of alternating between sitting and standing) (tr. 71-72). Finally, the VE testified that to the extent any differences existed between the way the jobs he identified are performed and the way they are described in the Dictionary of Occupational Titles ("DOT"), he stood by his earlier testimony that the jobs he identified could be performed even if a sit/stand option is required (tr. 73-74).
It is abundantly clear from VE Strader's testimony that the ALJ's findings at step four and step five are not undermined by Plaintiff's need to alternate between sitting and standing. The VE's testimony unequivocally establishes that Plaintiff can perform either her past relevant work or other available work if she needs to alternate between sitting and standing.
As to Plaintiff's testimony that she took breaks as needed when she worked for CH, and the ALJ's failure to include this additional limitation in the hypothetical question(s), the undersigned finds no error at either step four or step five. First, it is far from clear that Plaintiff actually needed to take breaks in order to work. Plaintiff made no mention of this requirement when she previously described her job at CH (see, e.g., tr. 192, 251). Moreover, during her testimony she merely stated she was allowed to take breaks as needed at CH 17 (tr. 45). She did not describe the nature of the breaks, such as their length or frequency, and she did not offer any other details regarding the breaks (see tr. 45). Additionally, Plaintiff subsequently testified that after she was fired she looked for jobs that were similar to her work at CH, such as jobs in nursing homes, convenience stores, and grocery stores, and she specifically noted that she looked for those jobs because they would allow her to "get up and down as needed" [*25] and work at her "pace," which she described as not having "to stand all day or sit all day" (tr. 49). Plaintiff did not state that she further limited her search to jobs that would accommodate a need for breaks (see id.). Even though Plaintiff later testified in response to a leading question by her representative—without any explanation or elaboration—that both accommodations were necessary (see tr. 64), Plaintiff's testimony as a whole may reasonably be construed as indicating that she could work with only one accommodation (that is, the ability to alternate between sitting and standing). The ALJ's finding at step four is therefore consistent the foregoing testimony. It is also consistent with Plaintiff additional testimony that she would have continued working at CH had she not been fired, and that prior to being fired she intended to continue working there and considered the job a permanent position.
Likewise, the ALJ did not err in making his alternative finding at step five. First, as previously noted, the VE testified that he had reviewed Plaintiff's vocational history, heard Plaintiff's testimony, and needed no additional information in order to provide his expert opinions. Coleman v. Astrue, 269 F. App'x 596 , 600 (7th Cir. 2008) ("Hypothetical questions posed to vocational experts ordinarily must include all limitations supported by medical evidence in the record. . . . However, an incomplete hypothetical may be cured and the omitted limitations imputed to the vocational expert where the expert independently reviewed the record and was present during the hearing.") (citing Young v. Barnhart, 362 F.3d 995 , 1003 (7th Cir. 2004)). Thus, even if Plaintiff's need for breaks is supported by the evidence of record, the ALJ's failure to include this limitation in hypothetical was cured by the VE's knowledge of the record and presence during Plaintiff's testimony. Second, Plaintiff's representative was provided with an opportunity to question the VE about any matter, including a need by Plaintiff to take breaks, but he did not ask the VE to consider this alleged need or whether it would affect his opinions as to Plaintiff's ability to work (see tr. 75). Third, Plaintiff continually sought work after she was fired, including during the time she received unemployment benefits when she was required to do so, and after her unemployment benefits ended when she was not required to do so. Her search for work, in places such as nursing homes, convenience stores, and grocery stores, is consistent with the ALJ's finding at step five that Plaintiff could perform other types of work. Similarly, Plaintiff's desire or intention to return to work is inconsistent with disability and indicates she did not view her limitations as disabling. See Bentley v. Shalala, 52 F.3d 784 , 786 (8th Cir. 1995); Barrett v. Shalala, 38 F.3d 1019 , 1024 (8th Cir. 1994) (claimant's statements that he was seeking work are inconsistent with disability).
In sum, by offering a clear hypothetical question that included "nearly all"—if not all—of Plaintiff's limitations, "the ALJ allowed [the VE] an opportunity to absorb all of [her] relevant limitations through a mixture [*26] of the hypothetical, the medical evidence in the record, and the hearing testimony." Coleman, 269 F. App'x at 601 (citation omitted). The ALJ then properly relied on the VE's testimony in making his alternative finding of "not disabled" at step five. See Phillips v. Barnhart, 357 F.3d 1232 , 1240 (11th Cir. 2004) ("A vocational expert is an expert on the kinds of jobs an individual can perform based on his or her capacity and impairments.").
Plaintiff's remaining claims as to the ALJ's findings may be summarized as follows: (a) the ALJ erred in failing to include in the hypothetical question the frequency in which Plaintiff would need to alternate between sitting and standing, citing SSR 96-9p, 1996 SSR LEXIS 6 ; (b) the ALJ erred by including in the hypothetical question an ability to perform "a relatively full range of light work"; (c) the VE's testimony is inconsistent with the DOT; and (d) the ALJ failed to comply with SSR 00-4p, 2000 SSR LEXIS 8 and SSR 83-12, 1983 SSR LEXIS 32 (both of which concern an ALJ's reliance on VE testimony at step five) (doc. 20 at 20, 29-30). These claims may be disposed of with little discussion.
All of the claims concern the VE's testimony in general and his testimony in response to the ALJ's hypothetical questions. The ALJ, however, did not need the VE's testimony at step four to conclude that Plaintiff could perform her past relevant work. Lamb v. Bowen, 847 F.2d 698 , 704 (11th Cir. 1988) (citing Schnorr v. Bowen, 816 F.2d 578 (11th Cir. 1987); Chester v. Bowen, 792 F.2d 129 (11th Cir. 1986)); see also Feist v. Astrue, No. 2:08cv454/TFM, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 95230 , 2009 WL 3275614 , at *6 (M.D. Ala. Oct. 13, 2009). Thus, even if the claims have merit—a finding the undersigned does not make—they do not undermine the ALJ's finding that Plaintiff can perform her past relevant work (a finding which in this case is bolstered by the VE's testimony, even though the testimony was not necessary at step four).
Although the claims could impact the ALJ's findings at step five (if they have merit), any error at step five would be harmless because the ALJ's ultimate conclusion of "not disabled" may be upheld based on his finding at step four. See, e.g., Ehrisman v. Astrue, 377 F. App'x 917 , 920 (11th Cir. 2010) (because the ALJ found the claimant not disabled at step four of the sequential evaluation, and the ALJ did not err at step four, there is no need to address her claim of error at step five). Plaintiff, therefore, is not entitled to relief.
Finally, it should be emphasized that in determining Plaintiff's RFC, the ALJ assigned great weight to the opinions of Dr. Francis, a board certified orthopedic surgeon (tr. 19). The ALJ did not err in doing so. Dr. Francis testified that he had reviewed Plaintiff's entire file, and he opined that Plaintiff could perform light work but should be restricted from working at unprotected heights. The RFC determined by the ALJ is thus wholly consistent with the opinion of a medical expert, who based his opinion on a review of Plaintiff's entire medical history. 18 Therefore, the ALJ's findings at step four and step five, which are based on the RFC, are well supported by the record and should not be disturbed.
D. Plaintiff's Credibility
Plaintiff contends the ALJ erred in discounting her subjective complaints of pain and other symptoms (doc. 20 at 20, 33-35). As this court is well aware, pain [*27] and other subjective complaints are treated by the Regulations as symptoms of disability. Title 20 C.F.R. § 404.1529 provides in part that the Commissioner will not find disability based on symptoms, including pain alone, "unless medical signs or findings show that there is a medical condition that could be reasonably expected to produce these symptoms." The Eleventh Circuit has articulated a three-part pain standard, sometimes referred to as the Hand test, as follows:
In order to establish a disability based on testimony of pain and other symptoms, the claimant must satisfy two parts of a three-part test showing: (1) evidence of an underlying medical condition; and (2) either (a) objective medical evidence confirming the severity of the alleged pain; or (b) that the objectively determined medical condition can reasonably be expected to give rise to the claimed pain.
Hand v. Heckler, 761 F.2d 1545 , 1548 (11th Cir. 1986) (originally adopting the three-part pain standard). The Eleventh Circuit continues to follow the Hand test. Wilson v. Barnhart, 284 F.3d 1219 , 1225 (11th Cir. 2002) (citing Holt v. Sullivan, 921 F.2d 1221 , 1223 (11th Cir. 1991); Ogranaja v. Commissioner of Social Security, 186 F. App'x 848 , 2006 WL 1526062 , at *3 (11th Cir. 2006) (quoting Wilson); Elam v. Railroad Retirement Bd., 921 F.2d 1210 , 1216 (11th Cir. 1991).

Underlying the Hand standard is the need for a credibility determination concerning a plaintiff's complaints. Those complaints are, after all, subjective. "[T]he ascertainment of the existence of an actual disability depend[s] on determining the truth and reliability of [a claimant's] complaints of subjective pain [or other symptom]." Scharlow v. Schweiker, 655 F.2d 645 , 649 (5th Cir. Sept. 1981) (holding that the ALJ must resolve "the crucial subsidiary fact of the truthfulness of subjective symptoms and complaints"). 19 People with objectively identical conditions can experience significantly different levels of pain, and pain is more readily treated in some than in others. "Reasonable minds may differ as to whethexr objective medical impairments could reasonably be expected to produce [the claimed symptom]. This determination is a question of fact which, like all factual findings by the [Commissioner], is subject only to limited review in the courts to ensure that the finding is supported by substantial evidence." Hand, 761 F.2d at 1548-49 . It is within the ALJ's "realm of judging" to determine whether "the quantum of [symptoms a claimant] allege[s] [is] credible when considered in the light of other evidence." Arnold v. Heckler, 732 F.2d 881 , 884 (11th Cir. 1984). The evidence as a whole, including the existence of corroborating objective proof or the lack thereof, and not just a physician's belief or the plaintiff's claims, is the basis for the ALJ's credibility determination.
Here, the ALJ found that Plaintiff's medically determinable impairments could reasonably be expected to cause some of her alleged symptoms, but he concluded that her statements concerning the intensity, persistence and limiting effects of these symptoms are not credible to the extent they are inconsistent with the RFC (tr. 20). In support of this credibility finding, the ALJ articulated numerous reasons, including the following: (1) Plaintiff'[*28] s daily activities are inconsistent with disabling limitations (and consistent with the RFC determination); (2) Plaintiff's treatment "has been essentially routine and/or conservative in nature"; (3) Plaintiff's medications and "injective therapy" have effectively controlled her symptoms; (4) Dr. Alexander, "a treating orthopedist," and Dr. Rohan opined that Plaintiff could work full time at the light duty level; (5) objective tests, including lumbar MRIs and a whole body bone scan, did not reveal significant abnormalities as would be expected if Plaintiff was as limited as she alleged; (6) physical examinations, including FCEs and musculoskeletal and neurological examinations, resulted in opinions that Plaintiff could perform full time light duty work or, similarly, revealed no significant abnormalities consistent with Plaintiff's complaints; (7) Dr. Evans' progress notes from the time frame relevant to this appeal do not support Plaintiff's "subjective complaints of severe and debilitating pain"; (8) Plaintiff displayed none of the typical signs to support a diagnosis of radiculopathy; (9) Dr. Horvat found evidence of only a mild adjustment disorder, assessed a GAF of 65, and indicated that there was no psychological Plaintiff could not work; (10) Dr. McDowell's treatment notes do not substantiate complaints of disabling mental limitations, nor do the GAF scores of record; (11) Plaintiff's allegedly disabling physical impairments were present at approximately the same level of severity prior to the alleged onset date, and the "fact that the impairments did not prevent the claimant from working at that time strongly suggests that [they] would not currently prevent work," especially considering that Plaintiff "stopped working for reasons not related to the allegedly disabling impairments"; (12) Plaintiff received unemployment compensation benefits from the fourth quarter of 2008 through the spring of 2010, and by "receiving these benefits, [Plaintiff] acknowledge[d] that she [was] willing, ready and able to work"; (13) Plaintiff's description of her symptoms and limitations, "provided throughout the record," have generally been inconsistent and unpersuasive; (14) Plaintiff's "portrayed no evidence of pain or discomfort" during her hearing (the ALJ emphasized that the fourteenth factor was "only one among many being relied on in reaching a conclusion regarding the credibility of [Plaintiff's] allegations" and noted that although Plaintiff's "hearing was short-lived and cannot be considered a conclusive indicator of the [her] overall level of pain on a day-to-day basis, the apparent lack of discomfort during the hearing is given some slight weight in reaching the conclusion regarding her credibility . . . ."); and (15) the opinions of Dr. Guttman, Dr. Dawson, Dr. Conger, and Dr. Meyers are inconsistent with Plaintiff's complaints of disabling limitations, as together these physicians concluded that Plaintiff could perform light to medium work and that her mental impairments are non-severe (the ALJ noted that although these physicians [*29] did not examine Plaintiff, "and therefore their opinions do not as a general matter deserve as much weight as those of examining or treating physicians," their opinions are entitled so "some weight, particularly in a case like this in which there exist a number of other reasons to reach similar conclusions") (tr. 20-22).
Plaintiff contends that four of the foregoing credibility findings were made in error, specifically, findings (as numbered by the undersigned) one (daily activities), two (routine and conservative treatment), seven (Dr. Evans' treatment records), and fourteen (Plaintiff's appearance and demeanor at the hearing) (see doc. 20 at 33-35).
Initially, even if these four finding were made in error, the ALJ's eleven other stated reasons for finding her less than fully credible would alone be sufficient to uphold his overall credibility findings. The four findings, however, were not made in error. As to finding number one, although Plaintiff testified she could perform only minimal daily activities, at other times she stated she could perform significantly greater activities. For example, during the time frame relevant to this appeal Plaintiff reported staying with her daughter and taking care of her daughter's baby (see footnote 7, supra), and she told Dr. McDowell that she loved yard work, she picked up and babysat her nieces (aged thirteen and nine), and she cared for her twin, four-year-old grandchildren. Therefore, the ALJ did not err in concluding that Plaintiff was not as limited as she testified. As to findings numbered two and seven, no further discussion is warranted, as Plaintiff asserted essentially the same arguments in support of earlier claims, and the undersigned has previously determined that those claims are without merit. And, as to finding number fourteen, as the ALJ clearly acknowledged, he could not rely on Plaintiff's appearance alone in support of his credibility findings, and he did not do so. Thus, he did not err. See Schnorr, 816 F.2d at 582 ("The Secretary relied on substantial evidence, including demeanor evidence, to conclude that [the claimant's] complaints were not credible."); Macia v. Bowen, 829 F.2d 1009 , 1011 (11th Cir. 1987) ("The ALJ is not prohibited 'from considering the claimant's appearance and demeanor during the hearing.'") (quoting Norris v. Heckler, 760 F.2d 1154 , 1158 (11th Cir. 1985)); see also Villa v. Sullivan, 895 F.2d 1019 , 1024 (5th Cir. 1990) (exclusive reliance on demeanor in credibility determinations is inappropriate, but it is not reversible error to consider demeanor as one of several factors in evaluating credibility); SSR 96-7p, 1996 SSR LEXIS 4 (eff. July 2, 1996) (an ALJ is permitted to "consider his or her own recorded observations of the individual as part of the overall evaluation of the credibility of the individual's statements").
For the foregoing reasons, the Commissioner's decision is supported by substantial evidence and should not be disturbed. 42 U.S.C. § 405(g) ; Lewis, 125 F. 3d at 1439 ; Foote, 67 F.3d at 1560 . Furthermore, Plaintiff has failed to show that the ALJ applied improper legal standards, erred in making his findings, or that any other ground for reversal exists.
Accordingly, it is respectfully RECOMMENDED that the decision [*30] of the Commissioner be AFFIRMED, that this action be DISMISSED, and that the clerk be directed to close the file.
At Pensacola, Florida this 11th day of February 2013.

Thus, the time frame most relevant to this appeal is June 2, 2008 (date of alleged onset) to August 18, 2010 (date of ALJ's opinion), even though Plaintiff is insured for DIB purposes through December 2013.

Light work is defined in 20 C.F.R. § 404.1567(b) as follows:
Light work involves lifting no more than 20 pounds at a time with frequent lifting or carrying of objects weighing up to 10 pounds. Even though the weight lifted may be very little, a job is in this category when it requires a good deal of walking or standing, or when it involves sitting most of the time with some pushing and pulling of arm or leg controls. To be considered capable of performing a full or wide range of light work, you must have the ability to do substantially all of these activities. If someone can do light work, we determine that he or she can also do sedentary work, unless there are additional limiting factors such as loss of fine dexterity or inability to sit for long periods of time.

On a disability report form, dated August 6, 2008, Plaintiff indicated she could take care of her personal needs, such as bathing, caring for her hair and dressing, and she could do laundry "a little over time," some housekeeping but not sweeping or mopping, and yard work or gardening if she worked slowly (tr. 204). Plaintiff also stated she could not "sit, stand, walk, bend twist, lift, or carry for more than [twenty minutes] at a time" (tr. 205), although she also reported traveling by car to and from a physician's office that is nearly fifty miles from her home (see tr. 51).

In April of 2006, Plaintiff asked Dr. Evans to write a letter stating that her CTS "was work related because she had been doing a lot of lifting," but Dr. Evans declined to do so because he was not certain that the CTS was related to Plaintiff's work (tr. 285).

A GAF score between 61 and 70 reflects mild symptoms (e.g., depressed mood and mild insomnia) or some difficulty in social, occupational, or school functioning (e.g., occasional truancy, or theft within the household), but generally functioning pretty well, with some meaningful interpersonal relationships.

fn

As previously noted, a GAF score between 61 and 70 reflects mild symptoms. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 30-32 (4th ed. 1994). A score between 51 and 60 reflects moderate symptoms. Id.

One treatment record, dated September 28, 2009, notes that Plaintiff previously experienced some daytime drowsiness, but her medications were apparently adjusted to eliminate this problem (see Tr. 632).

fn 
11
Plaintiff's brief, at thirty-five pages, far exceeds the limit of twenty-five pages set by this court in its scheduling order (doc. 15). Moreover, the brief is at times repetitive, and the claims are not clearly and concisely set forth therein, which has resulted in this court devoting an inordinate amount to this case and issuing an inordinately lengthy Report.

fn 
12
Plaintiff was primarily treated for her back by Dr. Evans during the time frame relevant to his appeal, and his treatment is discussed infra. 

fn 
13
The ALJ noted, in part, that Plaintiff's "most recent visit to Dr. Evans in March 2010 yielded a pain score of 3/10, which reflects only mild pain and is very inconsistent with the assessment and functional limitations offered by Dr. Akerson" (tr. 17). Numerous other records of Dr. Evans, as summarized supra, are similarly inconsistent with Dr. Akerson's opinions.

fn 
14
Plaintiff has also raised a related sub-claim, namely, that the ALJ erred in rejecting Dr. Akerson's opinion that she is "incapable of using both hands in fine manipulation" and failing to explain his reason for doing so (doc. 20 at 24-25). After summarizing Dr. Akerson's opinions on the check-off forms, including the opinion at issue here, the ALJ explained why he was assigning "little weight" to them (tr. 16-17). Thus, the ALJ did not ignore the opinion as Plaintiff appears to contend. Even if he had, any error by the ALJ in this regard would be harmless. Initially, as previously detailed, Dr. Akerson indicated on the most recent SRC that Plaintiff can use both hands in fine manipulation (tr. 749). Moreover, the record supports this third opinion of Dr. Akerson, not his earlier opinions to the contrary. Although Plaintiff was diagnosed with "severe bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome" by Dr. Evans, as Plaintiff points out in support of this sub-claim (see doc. 20 at 24 (citing tr. 455)), Dr. Evans' diagnosis was rendered in May of 2006, prior to Plaintiff's successful carpal tunnel release surgery in December 2006, and the successful surgery was prior to Plaintiff's alleged onset date of June 2, 2008. Additionally, records that post-date Plaintiff's successful surgery, but predate Dr. Akerson's opinions, clearly reflect that Plaintiff was "doing well" with regard to the CTS (see tr. 285 (Dr. Luarte's opinion); see also, e.g., tr. 286, 557, 560 (normal ranges of motion in—and/or normal examinations of—Plaintiff's upper extremities, hands, and/or thumbs and fingers); tr. 371 (nerve conduction studies performed on February 27, 2008, showed mild neuropathy at the wrist); tr. 558 (Plaintiff reported to Dr. Berliner that she could tie her shoes and button and unbutton her shirts); tr. 559 (Dr. Berliner noted that Plaintiff could hold a pen and write her name without difficulty); tr. 43, 58 (Plaintiff testified she could write notes and use a computer)). Additionally, after reviewing Plaintiff's medical records, Dr. Francis testified that Plaintiff's CTS is mild. Stated simply, there is no evidence in the record to support an opinion that Plaintiff cannot use both hands in fine manipulation.

fn 
15
Dr. Evans did, however, refer Plaintiff for two FCEs, as the ALJ noted (see tr. 13). The FCEs resulted in opinions that Plaintiff could work at light or sedentary-to-light levels of exertions. The results of these FCEs are consistent with the ALJ's overall findings. They also undermine any claim by Plaintiff that Dr. Evans' records support a finding of disability, because the FCEs were conducted at Dr. Evans' request.

fn 
16
Plaintiff's third claim regarding the opinions of her treating physicians needs no further discussion, as an ALJ need not include in the RFC limitations, restrictions, or opinions he has properly rejected or that are otherwise unsupported by the record. See McSwain v. Bowen, 814 F.2d 617 , 620 n.1 (11th Cir. 1987).

fn 
17
The alleged need appears in the lengthy record only once (that is, its brief mention during Plaintiff's testimony).

fn 
18
The ALJ also assigned substantial weight to the opinions of Dr. Fitzgerald, who examined Plaintiff in 2003 and twice opined that Plaintiff could perform light duty work (see tr. 12, 14). Plaintiff asserts error in this regard, noting that Dr. Fitzgerald's opinions were offered prior to the date she alleges she became disabled (doc. 20 at 17-18, 22, 27). To the extent error exists, it is harmless. Dr. Fitzgerald's opinions are fully consistent with the more recent opinions of Dr. Dawson and Dr. Francis, upon which the ALJ relied on—in part—in finding Plaintiff "not disabled." Dr. Fitzgerald's opinions are also consistent with the record as a whole, including the opinions of other specialists, the results of Plaintiff's MRIs, and the results of multiple physical examinations.

THOMAS B. SMITH 
ORDER
This case comes before the Court without oral argument on Defendant Peerless Network, Inc.'s Motion for Sanctions and to Compel a Complete Production (Doc. 62). Both Plaintiffs have filed responses in opposition to the motion (Docs. 70-71).1 For the reasons that follow, the motion is due to be GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.
I. Background 
This action arises out of a dispute between Plaintiffs Local Access, LLC ("Local Access") and Blitz Telecom Consulting, LLC ("Blitz"), and Defendant Peerless Network, Inc. ("Peerless"), over the planned sale of Blitz to one of Peerless' competitors. The amended complaint alleges that in late 2011, Blitz engaged investment bank and brokerage firm Cantor Fitzgerald to explore the market and identify and approach potential buyers of Blitz or a subset of its assets (Doc. 4, ¶ 16). Cantor Fitzgerald identified West Corporation ("West") as a prospect willing to pay $8.5 million for Blitz, as evidenced by a letter of intent (Doc. 62 at 2). Plaintiffs allege that Peerless fraudulently induced Blitz to forego this opportunity and later breached a contract with Local Access (Doc. 4). Peerless has counterclaimed against Local Access for breach of contract and quantum meruit (Doc. 34).
Peerless propounded its first request for production of documents to Plaintiffs on December 24, 2014 (Doc. 62-8). Plaintiffs interposed objections, counsel conferred, and at the end of April, Plaintiffs began producing documents on a rolling basis (Doc. 62 at 7). Plaintiffs made their final production on July 7, 2015 ( Id. at p. 10). Peerless argues that Plaintiffs have failed to produce all responsive documents (Doc. 62). Plaintiffs represent that they have searched their files in good faith and, with the exception of documents for which an objection has been interposed, have produced all documents requested by Peerless (Doc. 70, p. 2; Doc 71, p. 2).
II. Standard 
"[P]arties may obtain discovery regarding any non-privileged matter that is relevant to any party's claim or defense." Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1) . Still, there are limits to what a party may discover. A court "must limit the frequency or extent of discovery" if it determines that [*2] the discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative or more reasonably obtainable from another source; that the requesting party has had ample opportunity to obtain information; or that the burden of the proposed discovery outweighs the likely benefits, "considering the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, the parties' resources, the importance of the issues at stake in the action, and the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues." Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(2)(C) .
Parties may serve requests "to produce and permit the requesting party or its representative to inspect, copy, test, or sample" documents, electronically stored information, or other "tangible things" that are "in the responding party's possession, custody, or control." Fed. R. Civ. P. 34(a)(1) . Requests "(A) must describe with reasonable particularity each item or category of items to be inspected; (B) must specify a reasonable time, place, and manner for the inspection ... ; and (C) may specify the form or forms in which the electronically stored information is to be produced." Fed. R. Civ. P. 34(b)(1) . The recipient of a request for production has 30 days to respond. Fed. R. Civ. P. 34(b)(2)(A) . "[A]n evasive or incomplete disclosure, answer, or response" is "treated as a failure to disclose, answer, or respond." Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(4) .
Rule 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorizes a motion to compel discovery when a party fails to provide proper response to requests for production of documents under Rule 34. Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(3)(B) . "The proponent of a motion to compel discovery ... bears the initial burden of proving that the information sought is relevant." Moore v. Lender Processing Servs. Inc., No. 3:12-CV-205-J, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78971 , [2013 BL 147400], 2013 WL 2447948 , at *2 (M.D. Fla. June 5, 2013) (internal quotations omitted) (quoting Diamond State Ins. Co. v. His House, Inc., No. 10-20039-CIV, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5808 , [2011 BL 420554], 2011 WL 146837 , at *5 (S.D. Fla. Jan. 18, 2011)). The party moving to compel discovery must certify that it "has in good faith conferred or attempted to confer with the person or party failing to make disclosure or discovery in an effort to obtain it without court action." Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(1) . See also M.D. Fla. R. 3.01(g) .
III. Discussion 
Peerless cites numerous requests for production to show that it made comprehensive requests for documents relating to Plaintiffs' claims, but it does not specify which requests Plaintiffs failed to comply with (Doc. 62, pp. 4-7). Accordingly, instead of discussing specific requests for production, the Court will address separately each allegedly missing document or category of documents.
Peerless argues that Plaintiffs have not produced requested financial data or documents related to Cantor Fitzgerald or West. ( Id. at pp. 2-3). In support of this contention, Peerless cites to a number of documents or categories of documents as evidence that Plaintiffs' productions were deficient.
Blitz represents that it has produced all of the documents in its possession that it previously gave to West or Cantor Fitzgerald (Doc. 70, p. 8). Blitz also represents that in an effort to ensure that its production was complete, it asked Cantor Fitzgerald for any documents Blitz sent to it and any documents Cantor Fitzgerald prepared and provided to West, so that [*3] Blitz could produce them to Peerless ( Id.). Cantor Fitzgerald had produced a few documents when Peerless served a subpoena on it ( Id.). Upon receipt of the subpoena, Cantor Fitzgerald referred the matter to its lawyers ( Id.). Since then, the Court understands Blitz has not received any additional documents from Cantor Fitzgerald.
Peerless argues that a May 11, 2012 letter of intent from West indicates that Cantor Fitzgerald and Blitz provided financial information and data to West during negotiations for the sale and purchase of Blitz (Doc. 62, p. 11). It asserts that this financial information and data has not been produced ( Id.). The pertinent language in the letter of intent provides:
West has performed only limited due diligence to date. We would need to complete our due diligence review prior to entering into a definitive agreement .... Our due diligence investigation would be customary for a transaction of this nature and would include a review of the Business's recent financial results, projections, CLEC agreements, customer relationships, sales pipeline, technology, operations, tax compliance, and legal and regulatory matters.
(Doc. 62-2, pp. 2-3). Peerless' arguments to the contrary notwithstanding, the letter of intent shows that if it was accepted, West would require substantial due diligence. The letter of intent does not evidence that when it was written, Cantor Fitzgerald and Blitz had already provided financial information and data to West.

Peerless subpoenaed documents concerning this lawsuit from West (Doc. 62, p. 11). Among the documents West produced in response to the subpoena are several financial statements it received from Blitz, which Blitz never produced to Peerless ( Id.). Blitz represents that these documents do not reside in its files or systems and it speculates that they may be internal documents created by West or Cantor Fitzgerald (Doc. 70, pp. 10-11).
West also produced documents titled "BTC [Blitz] February 2012 Billing Summary," "BTC Top Customers," "Cantor BTC Jan-March 212 Revenues," and "Cantor Revenue by Category Report—Cash & Accrual Basis—Recip." (Doc. 62, pp. 11-12). Again, Blitz represents that these documents are not contained in its files, and speculates that they may have been prepared by Cantor Fitzgerald (Doc. 70, p. 11). In particular, Blitz points to documents labelled "BTC Top Customers" and "BTC February Billing Summary 2012" which are stamped as Cantor Fitzgerald's confidential documents and are not in a form typically used by Blitz ( Id.).
Peerless next points to a meeting request from Cantor Fitzgerald to Blitz for a "Call to go over West due diligence requests." (Doc. 62, p. 11). Attached to the request is an Excel spreadsheet titled "Barrage Diligence Requests" ( Id.). The spreadsheet includes a list of data requested by West, as well as notes on the response ( Id.). According to the spreadsheet, West had asked for "revenue broken down by Product/Service (DID, DSO Port, Usage, Recip Comp)," and the spreadsheet notes that "[w]e have for Sept-11 through Feb-12." ( Id.). The spreadsheet indicates that Blitz can demonstrate revenue "using Blitz [*4] Customer Accounting History 2007 to Feb 2012 detail.xlsx." ( Id.). Peerless alleges that this Customer Accounting History was not produced, information breaking down revenue by product was not produced, and no information regarding revenue for either Plaintiff was produced ( Id.).
Once again, Blitz represents that it has already produced everything in its possession (Doc. 70, p. 9). It also notes that of the 9 due diligence items listed on the spreadsheet, 3 indicate that the documents were outstanding and not yet produced to West, including the last 3 years of financials ( Id. at pp. 9-10 ). Another item references a discussion to be had in person and not documents ( Id.). Blitz represents that it has already produced the management presentation referred to in item 5 (See Doc. 70, Exhibit G, to be filed under seal). "Blitz does not recall which specific documents are referred to in items 2 and 3 which is the 'Blitz Customer Accounting History 2007 to Feb. 2012 detail' that Peerless complains about. Despite its good faith search, Blitz did not have any documents in its records that would fit the item description." (Doc. 70, p. 10). "As to the page stamped BTCLA0000187, Items 8-8D, 10 and 11 are marked as outstanding and not produced to West and item 9 was contained in the management presentation which was produced." ( Id.).
Next, Peerless points to an email it says indicates that Cantor Fitzgerald actually had up to three offers for Blitz to consider but only documents relating to West have been produced (Doc. 62, p. 10). The email states that Blitz was "obligated to Cantor Fitzgerald to talk to the 3 opportunities they have before [Blitz] over the next couple weeks." (Doc. 62-3). Blitz represents that "[t]he only formal written offer that Blitz received was from West through Cantor Fitzgerald and it was produced by Blitz." (Doc. 70, p. 12). Blitz also represents that "Cantor Fitzgerald explored many opportunities and only Cantor Fitzgerald knows how many other potential acquirers it spoke with as not all opportunities were even presented to Blitz." ( Id.).
Peerless' Production Request 9 seeks "[a]ll documents, ESI and things relating to, referencing, or identifying communications with any potential acquirer of Blitz." (Doc. 62-8, p. 9). Blitz acknowledges that there were potential acquirers of Blitz other than West and that Cantor Fitzgerald presented other "opportunities" to Blitz (Doc. 70, p. 12). Regardless of whether a formal offer was made, documents and ESI relating to, referencing, or identifying communications with these potential acquirers falls within the scope of Peerless' Production Request 9. The documents also fall within the scope of Peerless' Production Request 15, which seeks documents related to Cantor Fitzgerald's work performed on Blitz' behalf (Doc. 62-8, p. 9). Peerless' motion to compel response to Production Request 9 is therefore GRANTED. Blitz is ORDERED to further respond to Peerless' Production Request 9 by producing all documents in its possession or control which relate to communications with any potential acquirer of Blitz. Production shall be made within ten ([*5] 10) days from the rendition of this Order.
In the related case of Blitz Telecom Consulting, LLC v. Peerless, M.D. Fla. Case No. 6:14-cv-307-Orl-40GJK (the "307 Case"), Peerless requested the production of all financial statements prepared by Blitz or on its behalf from January 1, 2010 to the present (Doc. 60, p. 12 in the 307 Case). Blitz objected and the dispute was presented to the Court ( Id.). On May 14, 2015, the Court ordered Blitz to produce the financial statements by May 21, 2015 ( Id., at p. 16). On June 2, 2015, Blitz produced five pages, each representing a year of its business from 2010 to 2014 (Doc. 62-15). Peerless argues that Blitz failed to comply with the Court's order in the 307 Case because the financial statements it produced contain only total income, total expense, and net income figures (Doc. 62, pp. 8-9). Peerless complains that Blitz has refused to produce anything more detailed and Local Access has refused to produce any financial data ( Id.).
As a threshold matter, if either plaintiff violated an Order in the 307 Case, then that should be the subject of a motion filed in that case. Blitz represents that the financial statements it has produced are all that it has. It states that it has never had the need for detailed financial statements because it is not a publicly traded company, it has never applied for a loan, it has no lenders, and it does not retain accountants to prepare audited statements (Doc. 70, p. 6). Instead, Blitz says that it is a limited liability company with only three members, all of whom are active in the business ( Id.). The Court accepts these representations and, based upon them, Peerless' motion for relief based upon Blitz' alleged failure to produce more detailed financial statements is DENIED.
Local Access states that it is a small, limited liability company with only two members who are both active in the business (Doc. 71, pp. 2-3). It says it has no lenders, has never applied for a loan, does not employ accountants to prepare financial statements, has no need for financial statements, and does not have financial statements ( Id.). Nevertheless, Local Access was willing to prepare and produce statements similar to the statements produced by Blitz, but did not do so once Peerless filed its motion to compel ( Id.). The Court accepts Local Access' representations and, based upon them, Peerless' motion for relief based upon Local Access' alleged failure to produce more detailed financial statements is DENIED.
Plaintiffs have disclosed an expert report prepared by Stephen Gaines which identifies the documents he reviewed, including "Blitz Telecom Presentation by Cantor Fitzgerald (2012)," "Cantor Blitz Response Sheet," "Elements of Valuation of Blitz," "Combined OpenSIPS Active Calls data—by day and by week (May 2015)," "Intercarrier Compensation Reform Timeline," and "Breakout of Revenue Categories (2012-June 2015)." (Doc. 62-5, p. 14). Peerless argues that these documents are responsive to its requests for production and were not produced until the day after it received Gaines' report (Doc. 62, p. 12). Peerless also argues that the following statement in Gaines' report [*6] is proof that Plaintiffs intend to provide additional information to Gaines:
I will get a breakdown for you than [sic] shows what bucket and rate applies for Blitz traffic today versus Summer 2012. The value of the company is almost as simple as a spreadsheet that breaks it down why you put in the total minutes. I have to update it, but I will have it to you the first of next week.
( Id. at pp. 12-13). Based upon these alleged discovery violations, Peerless contends that Gaines' report should be stricken ( Id. at pp. 14-18).

Blitz characterizes this part of Peerless' motion as "not true and [ ] just another blatant misrepresentation by Peerless." (Doc. 70, p. 13). Gaines' report lists twelve documents he relied on to formulate his opinions (Doc. 62-5, p. 14). Per Blitz, Peerless is erroneously contending that "Blitz Telecom Presentation by Cantor Fitzgerald," "Cantor Blitz Response Sheet," "Elements of Valuation of Blitz," "Combined OpenSIPS Active Calls data — by day and by week," "Intercarrier Compensation Reform Timeline," and "Breakout of Revenue Categories" were not produced during discovery (Doc. 70, p. 13). Blitz represents that the "Blitz Telecom Presentation by Cantor Fitzgerald" was created in July 2015 by deleting slides from a slide presentation produced during discovery ( Id., Exhibit J). Blitz further represents that the remaining documents were created on July 18, 2015, to assist Gaines in preparing his report and were produced to Peerless on July 21, 2015, i.e., the day after Gaines' report was produced, because Gaines inadvertently failed to attach them to his report ( Id. at p. 14). Blitz also contends, and the Court agrees, that Peerless failed to address the "Combined OpenSIPS Active Calls data — by day and by week" and "Intercarrier Compensation Reform Timeline" in its "meet and confer letter" of July 22, 2015 (Doc. 62-26).
It appears that Peerless has all of the documents Gaines references in his report. Peerless argues that it "is entitled to the underlying data to make its own judgments and calculations." (Doc. 62, p. 14). Peerless asks "Where are the profit and loss statements, the general ledgers, the balance sheets, the statements of retained earnings and cash flow, the income statements, the projections, etc.?" ( Id.). As discussed supra, the Court is satisfied that Plaintiffs have produced all of the financial statements in their possession. As to Peerless' argument that they are entitled to the data underlying the financial statements, Peerless has failed to connect its argument to any particular discovery request, and it is not immediately apparent from a review of Peerless' requests that the information was requested. This part of Peerless' motion is therefore DENIED.
On July 9, 2015, Peerless issued a notice of taking a Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6) deposition of Blitz (Doc. 62-12). The notice includes a request for the production of 10 categories of documents ( Id. at pp. 7-8). In a letter dated July 23, 2015, Blitz made multiple objections to the deposition notice (Doc. 62-13). Peerless argues that Plaintiffs have not produced all of the requested documents (Doc. 62, pp. 7-8). But, Peerless' motion to compel [*7] was filed in advance of the deposition and only after the motion was filed did Peerless respond to Blitz' objections (Doc. 70-3). The Court is persuaded by Blitz' evidence and arguments that Peerless did not satisfy the meet and confer requirements of Local Rule 3.01(g) before filing the motion to compel the documents listed in its Rule 30(b)(6) deposition notice. This part of Peerless' motion is therefore DENIED.
Finally, Peerless seeks an extension of time to produce an expert report on Blitz' present value and value in 2012 (Doc. 62, pp. 22-23). Peerless represents that it cannot provide an expert report until the requested documents are produced. The motion to compel is being DENIED except to the extent that Blitz has documents relating to potential acquirers other than West. Whether such documents are in Blitz' possession or control is unknown. Regardless, the Court finds that Peerless has not shown good cause for the requested extension because it has not provided facts to support the conclusion that it cannot produce its expert report without these documents. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b)(4) . Lastly, when the Court extended the deadline for Peerless to disclose its expert reports to August 3, 2015, it said there "will be no further extensions of deadlines of any kind." (Docs. 55, 56). For these reasons, the motion for an extension of time is DENIED.
DONE and ORDERED in Orlando, Florida on September 25, 2015.

Plaintiffs object to being named in a single motion. Plaintiffs assert that they keep separate business records, have separate claims against Peerless, and that separate motions should have been filed against them (Doc. 70 at 1; Doc. 71 at 1).

PROCAPS S.A., Plaintiff, v. PATHEON INC., Defendant. 
  

1:12-cv-24356-JG 
October 20, 2014 

JONATHAN GOODMAN, Magistrate Judge. 
ORDER DENYING DEFENDANT PATHEON'S "MOTION FOR JUDGMENT" (BUT PROVIDING OTHER RELIEF)
Plaintiff Procaps, S.A. filed this lawsuit, which primarily seeks treble damages under the federal antitrust laws, in December 2012. [ECF No. 1]. Since then, Defendant Patheon Inc. has filed a motion to dismiss [ECF No. 34], a motion for judgment on the pleadings [ECF No. 170], a summary judgment motion [ECF No. 332] and a response to Procaps' motion for reconsideration of the Court's order on the competing summary judgment motions [ECF No. 580]. Not counting exhibits, Patheon's motions (with supporting memoranda and reply memoranda) total more than 150 pages. The Court also held an all-day hearing on Patheon's summary judgment motion (and Procaps' summary judgment motion) [ECF No. 484] and entered a 52-page ruling on the summary judgment motions [ECF No. 565].
After the close of discovery and after the protracted litigation outlined above (i.e., there are now 606 docket entries as of October 20, 2014), Patheon has now filed a request for relief it calls a "Motion for Judgment," arguing, in essence, that Procaps cannot prove its case under the rule of reason standard which this Court determined is the type of analysis appropriate to evaluate Procaps' antitrust claim. [ECF No. 581]. Patheon alleges that Procaps has not adequately disclosed its rule of reason theory because it focused on a per se claim and repeatedly disavowed an intent to proceed under any type of rule of reason approach. [Id. at p. 2]. Patheon also alleges that Procaps avoided discovery obligations by persuading Patheon and the Court, based on representations about the nature of the case, that certain discovery was irrelevant because it related only to a per se claim which was not then being pursued. [Id. at pp. 6-9].
There is no doubt that Procaps focused its energies on a per se claim. Likewise, it is also correct that Procaps repeatedly advised that it would not litigate its claim under a rule of reason approach. [Id.]. However, it is also true that Procaps ultimately advised, at the summary judgment hearing, that it would still pursue its claim if it lost on its per se theory - but would accept Patheon's market definitions.
During discovery, Procaps avoided its obligation to provide certain discovery responses relating to a rule of reason approach by taking the position that the discovery was irrelevant. [See e.g. ECF No. 147]. Based on these concessions, Patheon agreed to not pursue and compel certain discovery. [ECF No. 146, p. 5]. Given Procaps' current position that it will now be pursuing a rule of reason antitrust claim, some of the discovery responses it avoided are now relevant.
Given this procedural history, and notwithstanding Procaps' representations about pursuing only a per se theory, the Undersigned is not now going to impose the most-severe remedy and simply enter judgment in Patheon's favor based on a failure to supplement discovery responses or its obvious change [*2] in focus following the Court's ruling on the competing summary judgment motions. Therefore, the Court denies Patheon's Motion for Judgment.
Nevertheless, the Undersigned is not going to permit Procaps' strategic shift to unduly prejudice Patheon.
Therefore, Procaps shall by November 24, 2014 provide to Patheon all discovery responses it did not previously provide because it induced Patheon to drop efforts to compel production based on representations that it was proceeding solely on a per se rule and would not be invoking the rule of reason. Therefore, Procaps must provide a full, in-depth, comprehensive response to Interrogatory 20 (and others, if applicable) and must produce the responsive documents and ESI it previously failed to produce because Patheon and the Court accepted at face value its protestations about not using a rule of reason mode of analysis.
Recognizing the acrimony inherent in this litigation and in an effort to avoid further undue delay, the Court is requiring the parties to confer about discovery within the next few days and attempt to agree upon which discovery responses must be provided. If the parties cannot agree, then they must by October 28, 2014 advise the Court of the logjam so that the Court can schedule a hearing to resolve the dispute.
Because the Undersigned does not know what discovery will be provided, Patheon is likely unable to now predict whether the discovery it will soon receive will generate the need for additional depositions or other types of discovery. The Court is not now determining whether it will permit Patheon to seek additional discovery after receiving the discovery which Procaps will soon be providing, but it will give Patheon the opportunity to file a motion seeking additional discovery. In the absence of extremely compelling circumstances, the Court will not allow Procaps that opportunity, as it is Procaps who created this dilemma by repeatedly advising that the case was based only on a per se rule.
In addition to requiring Procaps to provide discovery, the Court is also going to permit Patheon to file a summary judgment motion (limited solely to the issue of whether Procaps has established a prima facie antitrust claim under the rule of reason analysis). The motion, if filed, may not reargue any of the arguments previously raised in Patheon's first summary judgment motion. Procaps may not file another summary judgment motion, however. The Court is not yet establishing a deadline for Patheon's to-be-filed summary judgment motion because it will depend on when Procaps provides the discovery it previously withheld, what information is disclosed pursuant to the forensic analysis of Procaps' ESI and whether additional depositions or other discovery (propounded by Patheon) will be permitted. The Undersigned will issue a scheduling order on this summary judgment motion deadline when additional developments unfold.
DONE AND ORDERED.

SPECIAL MASTER'S REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION REGARDING DISPUTED PROVISION OF PROPOSED STIPULATED ORDER REGARDING THE PROTOCOL GOVERNING PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENT AND ELECTRONICALLY STORED INFORMATION
This matter came before the Special Master to address a dispute regarding Section X of the parties' proposed Stipulated Order Regarding the Protocol Governing Production of Documents and Electronically Stored Information ("ESI Protocol"). Following extensive negotiations and conferences with the Special Master, the parties have reached an agreement as to a number of issues. One issue, however, remains in dispute, and the undersigned issues the following report and recommendation, recommending entry of the proposed ESI Protocol attached as Exhibit A.
Background 
Pursuant to Rule 53 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure , the Court appointed the undersigned to serve as Special Master to attempt, among other things, to resolve informally any discovery disputes. [ECF No. 453] The Court instructed that if unable to resolve an issue, the Special Master is to issue a report and recommendation to the Court on any pending discovery dispute.
On September 30, 2015, the Plaintiffs moved for entry of an ESI production protocol. The motion addressed a number of issues, including: identifying potentially relevant electronic data that is inaccessible or incapable of being processed for production, providing attachment information for scanned hard-copy documents, meeting and conferring regarding production of embedded data "pulled" from other sources, and extensively redacting non-responsive or irrelevant information. The Defendants responded on October 13, 2015. The parties appeared at a telephonic hearing with the Special Master on October 21, 2015 to address remaining issues. The parties argued their respective positions and the undersigned made suggestions about the proposals advanced and how the parties might overcome their disagreement on provisions through a further meet and confer session.
Following the hearing, on November 9, 2015, the parties submitted to the undersigned revised positions and both provided amended proposals. (Plaintiffs' submission is attached as Exhibit B, and Defendants' response is attached as Exhibit C.) The parties stated that they had reached agreement as to all disputed issues, with the exception of Section X, dealing with production and redaction of irrelevant documents and irrelevant information. The parties indicated they were unable to reach agreement on this section and requested assistance of the undersigned.
Disputed Provisions of Section X 
As reflected in their November 9th submissions, Plaintiffs' proposed Section X provides:
Irrelevant attachments to responsive parent documents may be withheld from production provided that the responsive families are Bates numbered prior to production and a list of the removed irrelevant Bates-numbered documents, or a slip sheet for the removed irrelevant document indicating in substance "irrelevant attachment omitted," is provided and indicated in the metadata load file.
In addition, a producing party may redact competitively sensitive irrelevant information from otherwise responsive documents, provided that the redacted document is stamped in substance "irrelevant competitively sensitive material redacted" and the category/type of competitively sensitive irrelevant information being redacted is indicated within the redaction stamp, or provided in a list accompanying the production, or included in the metadata load file. Only categories/types of competitively sensitive irrelevant information that are agreed to by the parties in advance may be redacted from otherwise responsive documents under this protocol.

Defendants, on the other hand, propose the following:
Irrelevant documents in an otherwise responsive document family may be withheld from production provided that the responsive families are Bates numbered prior to production and a list of the removed irrelevant Bates-numbered documents, or a slip sheet for the removed non-responsive document indicating in substance "irrelevant attachment omitted," is provided and indicated in the metadata load file.
In addition, a producing party may redact the following categories of irrelevant information (i.e., information unrelated to Takata airbag inflators) from within otherwise responsive documents, provided that the redacted document is stamped in substance "irrelevant material redacted" and the category/type of irrelevant (i.e., non Takata airbag inflator) information being redacted is indicated within the redaction stamp, or provided in a list accompanying the production, or included in the metadata load file:
a) Pricing, profits, non-public financial information;
b) Parts, suppliers, or costs;
c) Design, development, and engineering;
d) Marketing and business strategy;
e) Other makes and models;
f) Non-US products; and
g) Service and quality issues.

Thus, the parties agree that irrelevant attachments may be withheld from production provided the responsive families are Bates numbered prior to production and a list of the removed irrelevant Bates-numbered documents, or a slip sheet for the removed non-responsive or irrelevant document indicating in substance "irrelevant attachment omitted," is provided and indicated in the metadata load file. They also agree that certain categories of competitively sensitive irrelevant information may be redacted from otherwise responsive documents, regardless of whether that information appears in an attachment or a parent document (provided the document is stamped, and the category or type of competitively sensitive irrelevant information is indicated). The main points of contention between the two proposals are limited, namely (1) whether redactions of irrelevant material should be limited to competitively sensitive information only or should be permitted to include material falling within the categories identified by Defendants as well; and (2) whether irrelevant documents in an otherwise responsive document family (other than attachments) should be withheld from production to the same degree as attachments.
As to the former issue regarding redactions, Plaintiffs state that although they view irrelevance redactions as inappropriate, "as a compromise only," they agree to permit redactions for agreed upon categories or types of competitively sensitive irrelevant information. They do not, however, specify what those categories of information should be and instead provide only that the categories must be "agreed to by the parties in advance." As set forth above, Defendants propose specific categories and contend that the parties have been unable to reach agreement on the categories of irrelevant information that may be redacted.
Regarding the latter issue, Plaintiffs argue that withholding irrelevant parent documents of otherwise responsive documents could hamper their ability to understand the responsive information because the parent document provides "the context in which the responsive attachment was created and provides information regarding why and to whom it was sent, among other things." Defendants, on the other hand, argue that irrelevant information that is not necessarily competitively sensitive should be subject to redaction, stating that "[u]sing the ESI protocol as a proxy to permit overly broad discovery that is really just a fishing expedition involving uninvolved vehicles, airbag supplies, and issues should not be permitted."
Recommendation 
1. Redaction of irrelevant information 
Although irrelevance redactions, which have not gained universal acceptance in courts, may lead to a host of issues down the road as the litigation progresses, the undersigned is not going to disturb the agreement between the parties that was obviously the work of conscientious negotiations. The parties have created a framework permitting the redaction of irrelevant information from documents and the exclusion from production of irrelevant attachments.
The disagreement as to this issue involves the categories of irrelevant information that may be redacted. Plaintiffs argue the redactions should be limited to competitively sensitive information that falls into certain unidentified categories that the parties must agree on at some point in the future. Defendants, on the other hand, have proposed a list of specific categories, the majority of which appear to involve competitively sensitive information. Plaintiffs' objection to many of Defendants' proposed categories is not fully apparent. To the undersigned, therefore, the dispute appears to boil down to the issue of whether a producing party should be permitted to redact information that is irrelevant, not otherwise "competitively sensitive," and that pertains to either makes and models not at issue in this litigation or non-US products also not at issue in this litigation (categories (e) and (f)).1 
Since the parties are willing to allow redaction of irrelevant information, redaction of information pertaining to makes and models not at issue in this litigation and non-U.S. products appears reasonable and unlikely to pose a hardship on the non-producing parties. Plaintiffs' failure to propose an alternative list of topics or to articulate why they would need information that is by definition irrelevant and deals with makes and models not at issues in the litigation and non-U.S. products leaves the undersigned choosing between an indefinite, potentially amorphous standard and a specific set of categories that appear to be well-tailored to the issues. As the parties have been unable to reach agreement on the approved categories, the undersigned therefore will recommend to the Court the adoption of Defendants' proposed second paragraph.
2. Withholding irrelevant documents from otherwise responsive document family 
The parties have agreed to the withholding of irrelevant attachments (otherwise known as "child documents"), presumably because neither party sees the need to expand what will likely be an enormous production of relevant documents. The issue of whether only irrelevant attachments may be withheld from production, or whether it is permissible to withhold irrelevant parent documents or documents with a family relationship other than a child or attachment is largely rendered moot in light of the above recommendation concerning redactions, at least as to Defendants' proposed categories. Neither party suggested that redactions of irrelevant information should be limited to attachments. Thus, under the redaction approach recommended above, the parties may redact irrelevant information from any document, including parent documents. To the extent there is disagreement about redacting vs. withholding parent documents, the undersigned finds that withholding is permissible with the following qualification. To satisfy the Plaintiffs' concern regarding the context of responsive attachments, the undersigned recommends that the producing party be required to disclose certain basic information from withheld parent documents, that is, information concerning the type of document (e.g., email, memorandum, fax, etc.), the date, the sender / author, recipient, and subject line or category of Defendants' proposed paragraph X into which the document falls. Responsive parent documents that do not fall within one of the categories for permissible redaction must be produced.
3. Recommended Section X 
Having reviewed the parties' submissions and having heard and considered the parties' positions, the Special Master recommends that the Court adopt the following language for the disputed Section X:
X. Irrelevant Documents and Information 
Irrelevant attachments to responsive parent documents may be withheld from production provided that the responsive families are Bates numbered prior to production and a list of the removed irrelevant Bates-numbered documents, or a slip sheet for the removed irrelevant document indicating in substance "irrelevant attachment omitted," is provided and indicated in the metadata load file.
A producing party may withhold from production irrelevant documents in an otherwise responsive document family if the irrelevant documents fall within one of the categories of irrelevant information listed below, provided that the responsive families are Bates numbered prior to production and a list of the removed irrelevant Bates-numbered documents, or a slip sheet for the removed non-responsive document indicating in substance "irrelevant document omitted" and the category/type of irrelevant (i.e., non Takata airbag inflator) information being withheld is provided and indicated in the metadata load file. For irrelevant documents withheld from production under this paragraph, the producing party must additionally disclose the type of document withheld (e.g., email, memorandum, fax, etc.), the sender(s), recipient(s), and subject line.
In addition, a producing party may redact the following categories of irrelevant information (i.e., information unrelated to Takata airbag inflators) from within otherwise responsive documents, provided that the redacted document is stamped in substance "irrelevant material redacted" and the category/type of irrelevant (i.e., non Takata airbag inflator) information being redacted is indicated within the redaction stamp, or provided in a list accompanying the production, or included in the metadata load file:
a) Pricing, profits, non-public financial information;
b) Parts, suppliers, or costs;
c) Design, development, and engineering;
d) Marketing and business strategy;
e) Other makes and models;
f) Non-US products; and
g) Service and quality issues.

The Special Master believes that this approach balances the parties' respective approaches. For the foregoing reasons, the Special Master recommends entry of the proposed ESI Protocol with the above-proposed Section X, attached as Exhibit A.
PURSUANT TO THE COURT'S ORDER OF APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL MASTER [ECF NO. 453], OBJECTIONS TO THE SPECIAL MASTER'S REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION MUST BE FILED WITHIN 5 DAYS OF THE FILING OF THE REPORT, WITH A RESPONSE DUE BY OPPOSING COUNSEL WITHIN 5 DAYS OF THE FILING OF THE OBJECTIONS.

Although Plaintiffs have not specifically articulated which categories contain irrelevant information that is something other than that which would qualify as "competitively sensitive" information, Plaintiffs' objection remains as does the resulting analysis by the undersigned.

JOEL B. TOOMEY 
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION1 
THIS CAUSE is before the Court on Defendants' Motions to Dismiss ("Motions") Plaintiffs' Second Amended Class Action Complaint ("SAC") (Docs. 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155), Plaintiffs' Consolidated Opposition thereto ("Opposition") (Doc. 158), Defendants' Replies 2 thereto (Docs. 176, 177, 178, 179, 180), and the parties' supplemental memoranda (Docs. 255, 256) filed pursuant to the Court's November 7, 2012 Order (Doc. 254). 3 On May 12, 2011, the Motions to Dismiss were referred to the undersigned for a report and recommendation regarding an appropriate resolution thereof. (Doc. 189.) On October 16, 2012, the Court held a hearing on the Motions. 4 (Doc. 252.)
I. Summary of Recommendation 
For the reasons stated herein, the undersigned recommends that the Motions be GRANTED to the extent that the SAC be DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE. Specifically, the undersigned recommends that Count I of the SAC, alleging violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ("RICO"), 18 U.S.C. § 1961 et seq., be dismissed without prejudice because it is premised on a fraud-on-the-market theory of reliance/causation/injury, which is not cognizable under RICO or applicable to the real estate market.
Similarly, the remaining counts should also be dismissed without prejudice because each of them also contains a claim that requires a causation element, which cannot be satisfied by a fraud-on-the-market theory. This theory has been recognized only in federal securities actions. See, e.g., Se. Laborers Health & Welfare Fund v. Bayer Corp., 444 Fed. App'x 401 , 405 (11th Cir. Oct. 24, 2011) ("Fraud on the market is essentially a creature of federal securities litigation."). There is no count in the SAC for securities fraud. For this and other reasons, these counts should be dismissed as well.
Finally, the undersigned recommends that Plaintiffs be allowed one, likely final, opportunity to attempt to state a viable claim. Although the SAC is Plaintiffs' third attempt at trying to state a claim, and it is doubtful that Plaintiffs will be able to remedy the significant pleading defect identified herein, the undersigned cannot yet conclude that repleading would be futile or that there is any other recognized ground to recommend dismissal with prejudice. Accordingly, the undersigned recommends that the SAC be dismissed without prejudice, and that Plaintiffs be given twenty (20) days to file a third amended complaint. 5 
II. Summary of Allegations of Plaintiffs' SAC (Doc. 141) 
Plaintiffs allege that from 2002 to 2007, the sixteen named Plaintiffs purchased a total [*3] of forty-nine properties in eleven residential communities 6 in four states (Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina), which were "developed by the Ginn and Lubert-Adler Defendants at prices that were fraudulently inflated." (Doc. 141 at 2 & ¶¶ 7-17, 26.) The scheme allegedly "involved every step of the real estate purchase process," including:
(1) developing extravagant plans and promises for a series of communities; (2) developing the communities just far enough to give credence to the promises of future amenities and values; (3) aggressively pursuing purchasers with lies and misrepresentations; (4) selling the properties at fraudulently inflated values supported by falsely recorded sales information; (5) obtaining and relying on fraudulent appraisals with the intent to deceive; and (6) enlisting the participation of complicit lenders willing to knowingly provide and finance property sales for fraudulent inflated amounts.
( Id. at 2 & ¶ 26.)

Although the length and prolixity of the SAC make the allegations difficult to synopsize, the undersigned will attempt to do so. 7 The named Plaintiffs purport to bring this action on their own behalf and "on behalf of a Class of all persons or entities that purchased real estate in Ginn developments, including but not limited to [the named developments]" apparently from 1998 through 2008, "or such time as will be established after a thorough review of Defendants' records." 8 ( Id. at 2, 34, ¶ 59.) Essentially, Plaintiffs describe Defendants' involvement in the alleged scheme as follows: Lubert-Adler and Wachovia provided the funding; RMA (the alleged predecessor-in-interest to ESI) developed the marketing, using e-mails, websites, faxes, and targeted mailings; RMA, Ginn, 9 and Lubert-Adler conducted sham lotteries, "whisper campaigns," and lavish launches, at which they made misrepresentations about limited availability and high demand for the properties, as well as the amenities that would be built; the bank Defendants 10 invited the prospective purchasers to the launch events, identified the purchasers who had been pre-approved for financing, and used appraisals that they knew or should have known were false; and Ginn Title falsely recorded sales information, such as sales prices and sales dates, which was subsequently used as a basis for the allegedly fraudulent appraisals, which also improperly incorporated the value of leasebacks and furniture packages and used dissimilar properties for comparables without value adjustment. ( Id. at ¶¶ 22-25, 28-58.) Plaintiffs also allege that Defendants' employees and executives, including Dean Adler (CEO of Lubert-Adler) and Bobby Ginn, purchased Ginn properties at discounted rates and "flipped them for substantial profits to unsuspecting buyers at inflated prices." ( Id. at ¶¶ 52-55.)
The SAC includes six counts and alleges: violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) of RICO as to all Defendants (Ginn Enterprise) and, alternatively, as to Ginn, Lubert-Adler, Ginn Title and ESI (Alternative Enterprise) (Count I); violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) of RICO as to all Defendants (Count II); civil conspiracy as to all Defendants ([*4] Count III); and negligent supervision as to Fifth Third (Count IV), SunTrust (Count V), and Wachovia (Count VI). 11 Each Defendant has moved to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a) , 9(b), and/or 12(b)(6).
III. General Motion to Dismiss and Pleading-of-Fraud Standards 
Under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court must determine whether the SAC sets forth sufficient factual allegations to establish a claim upon which relief can be granted. In evaluating whether Plaintiffs have stated a claim, the Court must determine whether the SAC satisfies Rule 8(a)(2). In addition, where, as here, the complaint contains fraud-based claims, the SAC must also satisfy the heightened pleading requirements of Rule 9(b).
Rule 8(a)(2) requires that a pleading contain a "short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief." Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2) . To satisfy this standard, a complaint must contain sufficient factual allegations to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 , 129 S. Ct. 1937 , 1950 , 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 , 556 , 127 S. Ct. 1955 , 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). "A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949 . Though detailed factual allegations are not required to satisfy this standard, Rule 8(a) demands "more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation." Id. Indeed, allegations showing "[t]he mere possibility the defendant acted unlawfully [are] insufficient to survive a motion to dismiss." Sinaltrainal v. Coca-Cola Co., 578 F.3d 1252 , 1261 (11th Cir. 2009); see also Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949 ("Where a complaint pleads facts that are 'merely consistent with' a defendant's liability, it 'stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief'") (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557 ). Rather, the well-pled allegations must nudge the claim "across the line from conceivable to plausible." Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570 .
Although the Court must accept well-pled facts as true, 12 it is not required to accept Plaintiffs' legal conclusions. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1949 (noting "the tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions"). In evaluating the sufficiency of a plaintiff's pleadings, the Court should make reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor, but is "not required to draw plaintiff's inference." Sinaltrainal, 578 F.3d at 1260 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). "Similarly, unwarranted deductions of fact in a complaint are not admitted as true for the purpose of testing the sufficiency of plaintiff's allegations." Id. (internal citation and quotation omitted); see also Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1951 (stating conclusory allegations are "not entitled to be assumed true").
In addition to satisfying the Rule 8 requirements articulated by Twombly and Iqbal, a plaintiff alleging fraud must "state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud." Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b) . 13 This particularity requirement is required so as to "alert[ ] defendants to the precise misconduct with which they are charged and [to] protect[ ] defendants against spurious charges of immoral and fraudulent behavior." Wagner v. First Horizon Pharm. [*5] Corp., 464 F.3d 1273 , 1277 (11th Cir. 2006) (alterations in original, internal citation omitted). Thus, to satisfy Rule 9(b), a complaint alleging fraud-based claims must set forth the following with respect to each allegation of fraud:
(1) precisely what statements were made in what documents or oral representations or what omissions were made; (2) the time and place of each such statement and person responsible for making (or in, the case of omissions, not making) same; (3) the content of such statements and the manner in which they misled the plaintiffs; and (4) what the defendants obtained as a consequence of the fraud.
Rogers v. Nacchio, 241 Fed. App'x 602 , 608 (11th Cir. 2007) (quoting Ziemba v. Cascade Intern., Inc., 256 F.3d 1194 , 1202 (11th Cir. 2001)).

Where a complaint alleges fraud-based claims against multiple defendants, Rule 9(b) requires specific allegations with respect to each defendant. Ambrosia Coal, 482 F.3d at 1317 ; Brooks v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Fla., Inc., 116 F.3d 1364 , 1380-81 (11th Cir. 1997). These specific allegations "should inform each defendant of the nature of his alleged participation in the fraud." Ambrosia Coal, 482 F.3d at 1317 (affirming dismissal of a RICO complaint on Rule 9(b) grounds where complaint failed to allege "the nature of each defendant's participation in the scheme," failed to identify "each alleged statement, document, or misrepresentation made with the proper level of precision," and failed to specify "the content or manner in which the statements [of misrepresentation] misled [the plaintiff]").
IV. Analysis 
On September 21, 2010, the Court entered an Order dismissing Plaintiffs' FAC without prejudice after finding that the FAC was deficient for a number of reasons. (Doc. 139.) The Court's Order provided, inter alia, that the SAC "must do a better job of concisely identifying who did wrong, what specific actions they took that were wrong and how the Plaintiffs were proximately and adversely affected by these actions." ( Id. at 19.) The SAC continues to suffer from many of the same deficiencies identified in the Court's September 21, 2010 Order. 14 Most importantly at this time, the SAC contains a basic fatal defect because it is premised on a fraud-on-the-market theory of reliance/causation/injury. Because such a theory is not applicable to real estate markets, and is recognized only in federal securities cases, the undersigned recommends that the SAC be dismissed without prejudice.
A. 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) (Count I) 
1. Specific RICO Pleading Standards 
To properly plead a RICO claim under § 1962(c), a plaintiff must plead facts supporting the following elements: "(1) conduct; (2) of [a RICO] enterprise; (3) through a pattern; (4) of racketeering activity." Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479 , 496 , 105 S. Ct. 3275 , 87 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1985). To support the pattern element, a plaintiff must plead facts to support the following sub-elements: (1) commission of two or more predicate acts of racketeering activity within a ten-year time span; (2) the predicate acts were related to one another; and (3) the predicate acts demonstrated criminal conduct of a continuing nature. Jackson v. BellSouth Telecomms., 372 F.3d 1250 , 1264 (11th Cir. 2004); 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5) . "Racketeering activity" means the violation of any of the criminal statutes set forth in § 1961(1)(B), which include the statutes criminalizing [*6] mail fraud ( 18 U.S.C. § 1341 ) and wire fraud ( 18 U.S.C. § 1343 ). 15 These elements must be pled with particularity under Rule 9(b) as against each Defendant. See Ambrosia Coal, 482 F.3d at 1317 .
In addition, in civil cases, "RICO plaintiffs must satisfy the requirements of 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) ," i.e., they "must show (1) the requisite injury to 'business or property,' and (2) that such injury was 'by reason of' the substantive RICO violation."  16 Williams v . Mohawk Indus., Inc., 465 F.3d 1277 , 1282-83 (11th Cir. 2006) (per curiam). "[C]ourts should scrutinize proximate causation at the pleading stage and carefully evaluate whether the injury pled was proximately caused by the claimed RICO violations."  Id. at 1287 (citing Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp., 547 U.S. 451 , 461 , 126 S. Ct. 1991 , 164 L. Ed. 2d 720 (2006)). Although plaintiffs are not required "to show that the injurious conduct is the sole cause of the injury asserted, . . . there must be 'some direct relation' between the injury alleged and the injurious conduct in order to show proximate cause."  Id. at 1287-88 (citing Anza, 547 U.S. at 457 ). "[I]t is enough for the plaintiff to plead and prove that the defendant's tortious or injurious conduct was a 'substantial factor in the sequence of responsible causation.'"  Id. at 1288 n.5.
"[D]irectness of relationship . . . [is required] for a variety of reasons." Holmes v. Sec. Investor Prot. Corp., 503 U.S. 258 , 269 , 112 S. Ct. 1311 , 117 L. Ed. 2d 532 (1992). "First, the less direct an injury is, the more difficult it becomes to ascertain the amount of a plaintiff's damages attributable to the violation, as distinct from other, independent, factors." Id. "Second, . . . recognizing claims of the indirectly injured would force courts to adopt complicated rules apportioning damages among plaintiffs removed at different levels of injury from the violative acts, to obviate the risk of multiple recoveries." Id. "[F]inally, the need to grapple with these problems is simply unjustified by the general interest in deterring injurious conduct, since directly injured victims can generally be counted on to vindicate the law as private attorneys general, without any of the problems attendant upon suits by plaintiffs injured more remotely."  Id. at 269-70.
2. Plaintiffs Are Relying on a Fraud-On-The-Market Theory Which Is Not Viable in This Context 
In view of the "direct relation" standard set forth above, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have not sufficiently pled that their injuries were proximately caused by Defendants' alleged scheme to defraud. The Court previously expressed its "concerns about the Plaintiffs' ability to satisfy RICO's proximate cause requirement" in its September 21, 2010 Order. (Doc. 139 at 17-18.) Although Plaintiffs were given an opportunity to replead their allegations, they have failed to cure the deficiencies pointed out in the earlier Order.
Plaintiffs also had an opportunity to address the issue of causation during and after the hearing on the Motions. Specifically, on November 7, 2012, the undersigned entered an Order directing the parties to file supplemental memoranda addressing the following three issues: (1) whether the SAC alleges a fraud-on-the-market theory of causation/injury; (2) if so, whether such a theory is cognizable under RICO and available with regard to alleged fraudulent price inflation [*7] of real estate; and (3) assuming that Plaintiffs are attempting to, but cannot, state a viable RICO claim that relies on a fraud-on-the-market theory, whether Plaintiffs should be allowed to replead their complaint or whether such repleading would be futile. (Doc. 254.)
Although Plaintiffs contend in their supplemental memorandum that they are not relying on a fraud-on-the-market theory to demonstrate causation or injury (see Doc. 255 at 6), the allegations in the SAC indicate otherwise. SeeIn re Schering-Plough Corp., 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58900 , 2009 WL 2043604 at *20 ("Plaintiffs do not expressly plead a fraud on the market theory of RICO injury, presumably because such a theory has been resoundingly rejected outside the context of federal securities fraud litigation."). 17 As an example, the SAC alleges that Plaintiffs "have suffered losses . . . because they paid too much for properties at the time they purchased them as a consequence [of the] fraudulent overpricing that resulted from the conduct" of Defendants. (Doc. 141, ¶ 103; see also id. at ¶¶ 100-02.) The SAC further alleges that absent Defendants' conduct, as a result of which "the apparent value of Ginn properties was inflated . . . , Plaintiffs and Class members would have been advised of and known the true market value of the properties at the time they purchased them and would not have paid, or agreed to pay, the above-market prices that they were induced to pay or agree to pay as a result of the scheme." ( Id. at ¶ 100 (emphasis added).) As Defendants point out in their supplemental memorandum, Plaintiffs' theory is that "the market failed Plaintiffs as a result of undisclosed information." (Doc. 256 at 9.)
As further indication that Plaintiffs rely on a fraud-on-the-market theory, they bring this action not only on behalf of the sixteen named Plaintiffs, but also on behalf of the extremely broad class of all purchasers of properties "in Ginn developments including but not limited to [the named developments]" apparently from 1998 through 2008, "or such time as will be established after a thorough review of Defendants' records." (Doc. 141 at 2, 34.) It is difficult to fathom how Plaintiffs could purport to bring this action on behalf of all purchasers of Ginn properties over an unspecified time period if they are not relying on a fraud-on-the-market theory. Plaintiffs are silent on how they plan to prove reliance, causation, and damages for this entire class other than by use of a theory that the entire market for Ginn properties was fraudulently inflated and that the entire class was thereby damaged.
Even as to the sixteen named Plaintiffs, the SAC is completely devoid of any plausible, non-conclusory allegations of causation. For example, the SAC is barren of any specific allegations that as a result of any particular allegedly fraudulent statement, e.g., a falsely recorded sales transaction, any person (plaintiff or non-plaintiff) relied on that statement and paid a higher sales price as a result thereof. 18 Further, there is no specific link alleged between any transaction involving a non-plaintiff and any of Plaintiffs' purchases. For example, [*8] the SAC does not allege that any individual Plaintiff paid a higher price for his or her property in reliance on a higher price paid by someone else who directly relied on a fraudulent statement. 19 The SAC contains only conclusory allegations that unspecified Plaintiffs relied on unspecified misrepresentations by unspecified Defendants. (See Doc. 141, ¶ 97 (stating in a conclusory fashion that "Plaintiffs and the Class relied on the misrepresentations and omissions").)
Based on the aforementioned allegations and lack of allegations, the conclusion is inescapable that Plaintiffs are relying on a fraud-on-the-market theory. SeeIn re Schering-Plough Corp., 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58900 , 2009 WL 2043604 at *21 ("While denominated as a premium price or price inflation theory of injury, it is abundantly clear that Plaintiffs' fourth theory of injury is actually a classic fraud-on-the-market theory normally pled in securities fraud cases, but one which is not cognizable under RICO."). The SAC is no different than any other fraud-on-the-market case, alleging that defendants' conduct led plaintiffs to pay a higher price than they would otherwise pay absent the allegedly fraudulent conduct. See FindWhat Investor Group v. FindWhat.Com, 658 F.3d 1282 , 1311 (11th Cir. 2011) ("In a fraud-on-the-market case[,] . . . the plaintiff's claim is generally . . . that the initial investment transaction . . . would have occurred at a different price [in the absence of the alleged fraud.]"); see alsoIn re Schering-Plough Corp., 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58900 , 2009 WL 2043604 at *21 ("To plead injury under a fraud-on-the-market theory, a plaintiff need only allege that the price of a drug 'was higher than it should have been as a result of defendant's fraudulent marketing campaign[.]'"). 20 Because Plaintiffs cannot rely on a fraud-on-the-market theory in this RICO real estate case, but seek to do so, the SAC must be dismissed. 21 
Although Plaintiffs contend that they are not relying on a fraud-on-the-market theory, they concede that this theory is not viable in this RICO case involving the real estate market. (Doc. 255 at 6.) As stated by the Eleventh Circuit, the fraud-on-the-market theory has been rejected "in any context other than federal securities fraud litigation." Se. Laborers Health, 444 Fed. App'x at 405 (stating that the fraud-on-the-market theory "is essentially a creature of federal securities litigation"); see alsoIn re Schering-Plough Corp., 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58900 , 2009 WL 2043604 at *20, 22 (stating that a fraud-on-the-market "theory has been resoundingly rejected outside the context of federal securities fraud litigation" and it "is not cognizable under RICO"). "[A]llowing a fraud on the market theory to satisfy the mandatory elements of ascertainable loss and causal nexus [in this case] would virtually eliminate the requirement that there be a connection between the misdeed complained of and the loss suffered." Se. Laborers Health, 444 Fed. App'x at 406 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).
The fraud-on-the-market theory is "a presumption of reliance in the securities fraud context where the defendant disseminates a fraud to an efficient capital market."  Id. at 405. "In that context, plaintiffs who purchased securities are permitted [*9] to demonstrate that they were damaged simply because defendant engaged in behavior otherwise prohibited and there was a change in price." Id. 
The fraud on the market theory is based on the hypothesis that, in an open and developed securities market, the price of a company's stock is determined by the available material information regarding the company and its business. . . . Misleading statements will therefore defraud purchasers of stock even if the purchasers do not directly rely on the misstatements. . . . The causal connection between the defendants' fraud and the plaintiffs' purchase of stock in such a case is no less significant than in a case of direct reliance on misrepresentations. . . . In this manner, evidence of a fraud disseminated to an open market creates a rebuttable presumption of reliance in the securities fraud context.
Id. (citing Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224 , 241-42 , 108 S. Ct. 978 , 99 L. Ed. 2d 194 (1988)). However, outside the securities market, the presumption of reliance is not present. See, e.g., Appletree Square I, Ltd. v. W.R. Grace & Co., 29 F.3d 1283 , 1287 (8th Cir. 1994). "The real estate market, unlike the stock market, is not a well-developed market in which the price of a building reflects all publicly available information." Id. 

As in Southeast Laborers Health, Plaintiffs in this case seek to use the fraud-on-the-market theory to establish not only reliance, but also causation and damages. However, as Plaintiffs concede, this theory may not be used in this context to establish any of these elements. Therefore, in the absence of viable allegations of causation, Plaintiffs' substantive RICO claim (Count I) fails.
B. The Remaining Counts (Counts II-VI) in the SAC 
In light of the above conclusion as to Count I, the remaining counts (Counts II through VI) in the SAC also fail because they are each premised on a fraud-on-the-market theory, which is not recognized in this context or for these claims.
In addition, regarding Count II, it is well-settled that plaintiffs cannot proceed on a RICO conspiracy claim under § 1962(d), 22 when they have not adequately alleged a substantive RICO violation. See Rogers, 241 Fed. App'x at 609 ("Thus, where a plaintiff fails to state a RICO claim and the conspiracy count does not contain additional allegations, the conspiracy claim necessarily fails."); Super Vision Intern., Inc. v. Mega Intern. Commercial Bank Co., 534 F. Supp. 2d 1326 , 1342 (S.D. Fla. 2008) ("Because [the court] concluded that Plaintiff had failed to state a claim for civil RICO under § 1962(c) or § 1962(a), [Plaintiff's] RICO conspiracy claim necessarily fails.").
Count III, alleging civil conspiracy under Florida law, also contains a causation requirement, which cannot be satisfied by a fraud-on-the-market theory. See Raimi v. Furlong, 702 So.2d 1273 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1997) ("A civil conspiracy requires: (a) an agreement between two or more parties, (b) to do an unlawful act or to do a lawful act by unlawful means, (c) the doing of some overt act in pursuance of the conspiracy, and (d) damage to plaintiff as a result of the acts done under the conspiracy.") (emphasis added).
Finally, Counts IV, V, and VI, alleging negligent supervision against the bank Defendants, should also be dismissed without prejudice because the underlying [*10] claim on which they are premised—civil conspiracy—fails as stated herein. Moreover, similar to Counts I-III, the negligent supervision counts have a causation element, which cannot be satisfied by a fraud-on-the-market theory. See Geidel v. Bradenton Beach, 56 F. Supp. 2d 1359 , 1366 (M.D. Fla. 1999) ("In order for Plaintiffs to sustain [a negligent and inadequate supervision count] which [is] predicated on negligence, they must establish: (1) existence of a duty on the part of the defendant to protect the plaintiff from the injury or damage of which he complains; (2) failure of the defendant to perform that duty; and (3) injury or damage to the plaintiff proximately caused by such failure.") (emphasis added, but internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Therefore, the undersigned recommends that all counts in the SAC be dismissed without prejudice.
C. Leave to Amend the SAC 
Plaintiffs request leave to amend the SAC in the event the Court dismisses any of the claims, and argue that amendment would be neither inequitable nor futile. (Doc. 255 at 25.) Defendants respond, inter alia, that "[i]f Plaintiffs could have made factual allegations that go beyond a fraud-on-the-market theory, or that cure the numerous other defects identified by Defendants in their motions to dismiss, Plaintiffs would have made them in the three complaints they filed . . . ." (Doc. 256 at 17.) Although the undersigned tends to agree with Defendants that Plaintiffs will not be able to cure this causation defect, it appears they should be allowed an opportunity to do so.
Rule 15(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that "[t]he court should freely give leave [to amend pleadings] when justice so requires." Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2) . The Supreme Court has stated that "this mandate is to be heeded." Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178 , 182 , 83 S. Ct. 227 , 9 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1962). The Supreme Court further stated:
In the absence of any apparent or declared reason—such as undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment, futility of amendment, etc.—the leave sought should, as the rules require, be "freely given." Of course, the grant or denial of an opportunity to amend is within the discretion of the District Court, but outright refusal to grant the leave without any justifying reason appearing for the denial is not an exercise of discretion; it is merely abuse of that discretion and inconsistent with the spirit of the Federal Rules.
Id. 

In light of the above-stated standard, the undersigned recommends that Plaintiffs be allowed one, likely final, opportunity to attempt to state a viable claim. Although plausible allegations of causation appear unlikely, the undersigned does not yet conclude that repleading would be futile. Further, although Plaintiffs have failed to cure at least the causation deficiency identified in this Court's September 21, 2010 Order, no "repeated" failure to cure has yet been shown. 23 Defendants have made no other arguments opposing amendment, such as "undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive" or "undue [*11] prejudice." Foman, 371 U.S. at 182 . Accordingly, the undersigned recommends that the SAC be dismissed without prejudice, and that Plaintiffs be given twenty (20) days to file a third amended complaint.
RECOMMENDATION
Accordingly, it is respectfully RECOMMENDED that:
1. The Motions (Docs. 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155) be GRANTED to the extent that Plaintiffs' SAC (Doc. 141) be DISMISSED without prejudice; and
2. Plaintiffs be allowed to file their third amended complaint within twenty (20) days of the Court's order on this Report and Recommendation. 24

In response to this Court's Order of September 21, 2010, Plaintiffs reduced the length of the First Amended Complaint ("FAC") (Doc. 71) from 135 to 68 pages and from 566 to 151 paragraphs. However, many such paragraphs still contain lengthy, single-spaced subparts in run-on paragraph format. (See, e.g., Doc. 141 at 25-28.) The SAC, although some improvement over the FAC, continues to suffer from many of the same problems.

"The 'by reason of' requirement implicates two concepts: (1) a sufficiently direct injury so that a plaintiff has standing to sue; and (2) proximate cause." Williams, 465 F.3d at 1287 . In the context of civil RICO claims these two concepts overlap. Id. at n.4.

The district court in In re Schering-Plough Corp. also stated:
The gravamen of Plaintiffs' theory of injury is that they suffered economic loss where the price of the Subject Drugs increased as a result of misrepresentations made by [defendant] in the off-label promotion of [the drugs]. This is, by definition, a fraud-on-the-market theory and one which is not cognizable under RICO.
2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58900 , 2009 WL 2043604 at *21-22. This language is directly applicable here, with the simple substitution of real estate for drugs.

Although the Court agrees with Plaintiffs that they need not show that they relied on Defendants' alleged misrepresentations, "the complete absence of reliance [by anyone involved] may prevent [Plaintiffs] from establishing proximate cause." Bridge, 553 U.S. at 641-42 , 650 , 658-59 ; see also G&G TIC, LLC v. Alabama Controls, Inc., 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75269 , 2008 WL 4457876 , *4 (M.D. Ga. Sept. 29, 2008) (stating that "in wire fraud cases, there is no requirement that a plaintiff itself rely upon a misrepresentation," but the plaintiff must allege that "someone relied upon a misrepresentation by the defendants and that the reliance directly caused harm to the plaintiff").

The Court is not implying that such remote reliance would be sufficient at any rate. See Holmes, 503 U.S. at 271 ("The general tendency of the law, in regard to damages at least, is not to go beyond the first step.").

Although Plaintiffs attempt to distinguish all fraud-on-the-market cases on their facts, the undersigned has reviewed the relevant cases cited by both sides and is unconvinced that those cases, which essentially dealt with an inflated price theory, are distinguishable.

Moreover, even if Plaintiffs could rely on a fraud-on-the-market theory, it is likely that the restrictions placed on such a theory in Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336 , 125 S. Ct. 1627 , 161 L. Ed. 2d 577 (2005), would apply. "Normally, in cases such as this one (i.e., fraud-on-the-market cases), an inflated purchase price will not itself constitute or proximately cause the relevant economic loss."  Id. at 342. Thus, merely alleging an inflated purchase price, as Plaintiffs have done, would likely not be enough to establish causation, even under a fraud-on-the-market theory. However, the Court need not decide how Dura might apply to the instant case because the fraud-on-the-market theory is not viable in this context.

"It shall be unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any of the provisions of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section." 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) .

Although this Court's September 21, 2010 Order warned Plaintiffs that failure to properly replead the FAC will result in dismissal with prejudice of Counts I and II on Rule 9(b) grounds, that Order was "the first time the Court has been called upon to address the viability of a complaint in this case." (Doc. 139 at 8 n.11, 17.)

To the extent Plaintiffs' supplemental memorandum requests that "this Court allow discovery to proceed immediately" (Doc. 255 at 14), the request is not properly before the Court unless included in an appropriate motion filed in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Local Rules of this Court.

K. MICHAEL MOORE 
ORDER GRANTING THE WYETH DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO DISMISS
This cause is before the Court on Defendants Pfizer, Inc. and Wyeth LLC's (collectively, the "Wyeth Defendants") Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff Maggie Tsavaris's First Amended Complaint [D.E. 40]. For the reasons discussed below, the motion is granted.
I. BACKGROUND 
Tsavaris brings this action against several pharmaceutical companies, including the Wyeth Defendants, for personal injuries she allegedly sustained after consuming their products. The First Amended Complaint [D.E. 30] asserts claims against the Wyeth Defendants for strict products liability—design defect (Count I), strict products liability—failure to warn (Count III), negligence (Count V), and negligent misrepresentation (Count VII) based on the design, manufacture, and distribution of Prempro, a hormone replacement therapy drug Tsavaris claims caused her breast cancer. First Am. Compl. ("FAC") ¶¶ 1-229. As relief, Tsavaris seeks compensatory and punitive damages, attorney's fees and costs, and a recall of Prempro.  Id. at 72.
The First Amended Complaint alleges as follows. In 2005, Tsavaris's gynecologist, Dr. Ellen Schwartzbard, prescribed her Prempro. Id. ¶ 18. Before receiving the prescription, Tsavaris disclosed to Dr. Schwartzbard her mother's breast cancer diagnosis at the age of 79 or 80. Id. ¶ 19. Nevertheless, Dr. Schwartzbard gave Tsavaris a prescription for Prempro, believing that Tsavaris's mother's advanced age at the time of diagnosis meant that hormone therapy did not pose an increased risk of breast cancer for Tsavaris. Id. 
A few months later, a partner in Dr. Schwartzbard's practice advised Tsavaris to discontinue use of Prempro because her ovaries were producing hormones. Id. ¶ 20. Tsavaris did so. Id. Tsavaris, however, "probably" resumed taking Prempro sometime after, but discontinued the drug altogether about four [*2] months later. Id. She did not use Prempro or any other hormone therapy product manufactured by the Wyeth Defendants again.
Tsavaris claims that Dr. Schwartzbard's decision to prescribe Prempro, despite her family history of breast cancer, was the result of the Wyeth Defendants "misrepresenting, downplaying, and/or concealing material facts . . . from the Plaintiff, the public, and the medical profession [regarding] the nature and scope of the serious side effects of the risk of breast cancer from their [hormone therapy] drugs." Id. ¶ 32. She maintains that the Wyeth Defendants "minimized the risk in its package inserts by assuring physicians that while some studies indicated an increased risk [of breast cancer], other studies did not." Id. ¶ 41. The falsity of this statement, Tsavaris contends, is demonstrated by scientific studies available at the time she was prescribed Prempro. Id. Even so, Tsavaris acknowledges that the Wyeth Defendants received approval from the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") for inclusion of a black box warning on the Prempro packaging concerning the risks of breast cancer. Id. ¶ 47.
The Wyeth Defendants move to dismiss the First Amended Complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted.
II. LEGAL STANDARD 
To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter to "state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face." Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 , 678 , 129 S. Ct. 1937 , 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (quoting Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 , 570 , 127 S. Ct. 1955 , 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). It must also contain enough facts to suggest the required elements of a cause of action. Watts v. Fla. Int'l Univ., 495 F.3d 1289 , 1302 (11th Cir. 2007). "[C]onclusory allegations, unwarranted deductions of fact or legal conclusions masquerading as facts will not prevent dismissal." Oxford Asset Mgmt., Ltd. v. Jaharis, 297 F.3d 1182 , 1188 (11th Cir. 2002). The purpose of this requirement is "to give the defendant fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests." Id . When considering a motion to dismiss, the court must accept all of the plaintiff's allegations as true in determining whether the plaintiff has stated a claim for relief. Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69 , 73 , 104 S. Ct. 2229 , 81 L. Ed. 2d 59 (1984).
III. DISCUSSION 
As shown more fully below, the claims against the Wyeth Defendants do not survive dismissal. Tsavaris does not allege enough facts to sustain her strict products liability and negligence claims, and she does not plead her negligent misrepresentation claim with the requisite specificity. Accordingly, the Wyeth Defendants' motion to dismiss is granted.
A. Count I (Strict Products Liability—Defective Design) and Count III (Strict Products Liability—Failure to Warn) Are Dismissed Without Prejudice For Failure To State A Claim 
Tsavaris fails to put the Wyeth Defendants on notice of how Prempro is defective or how the warnings she received were insufficient. Accordingly, her strict products liability claims in Counts I and III are dismissed without prejudice.
1. Count I (Strict Products Liability—Design Defect) 
The manufacturer of a defective product can be held liable if the plaintiff shows that (1) the defendant manufactured [*3] or distributed the product in question, (2) the product has a defect that renders it unreasonably dangerous, and (3) the unreasonably dangerous condition is the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury. Jennings v. BIC Corp., 181 F.3d 1250 , 1255 (11th Cir. 1999). In the context of an allegedly defective hormone therapy drug, the plaintiff must make clear "what the alleged defect(s) of each drug is and how each drug is unreasonably dangerous," show "how each drug caused her particular form of breast cancer," and identify "potential defects in each of the drugs that could have caused her cancer." Kaufman v. Pfizer Pharms., Inc., No. 1:02-CV-22692, [2010 BL 439784], 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 146552 , 2010 WL 9438673 , at *3 (S.D. Fla. Nov. 23, 2010). Merely concluding that the drug is defective is insufficient. See id . 
Tsavaris fails to plead any facts identifying Prempro's purported design defect. Rather, she merely declares that the product was "unreasonably dangerous," that its "risks of breast cancer exceeded any benefits or utility associated with the design or formulation," and that the drug is "much more dangerous than other available and safe alternative HT drugs." FAC ¶¶ 137, 139. Such conclusory allegations, without more, fail to state a design defect claim.
The Court rejects Tsavaris's "shotgun" form of pleading. The allegations in a complaint "must be simple, concise, and direct," Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(d)(1) , and the complaint must "state its claims . . . in numbered paragraphs, each limited as far as practicable to a single set of circumstances," Fed. R. Civ. P. 10(b) . A "shotgun pleading"—one in which "it is virtually impossible to know which allegations of fact are intended to support which claim(s) for relief"—does not comply with the pleading standards for a complaint. Taft v. The Dade Cty. Bar Ass'n, Inc., No. 1:15-CV-22072-KMM, [2015 BL 324309], 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 134798 , 2015 WL 5771811 , at *2 (S.D. Fla. Oct. 2, 2015) (citing Anderson v. Dist. Bd. of Trs. of Ctr. Fla. Cmty. Coll., 77 F.3d 364 , 366 (11th Cir. 1996)). It forces the district court to sift through the facts presented and decide for itself which are material to the particular claims asserted. See Anderson, 77 F.3d at 366-67 . The Eleventh Circuit "has addressed the topic of shotgun pleadings on numerous occasions in the past, often at great length and always with great dismay." Strategic Income Fund, L.L.C. v. Spear, Leeds & Kellogg Corp., 305 F.3d 1293 , 1297 n.9 (11th Cir. 2002) (citations omitted). While the allegations set forth under Count I do little more than recite the bare elements of a design defect claim, Tsavaris argues this is enough, pointing to allegations scattered throughout the facts section of the First Amended Complaint, which spans 36 pages, to show how Prempro was defectively designed. In doing so, Tsavaris expects the Court to dig through the almost 80 pages of her submission to discover and puzzle together the grounds for her claim. Such shotgun pleading is unacceptable.
For these reasons, Count I is dismissed without prejudice.
2. Count III (Strict Products Liability—Failure to Warn) 
Count III fails for the same reasons. To state a strict liability failure to warn claim, the plaintiff must plead that the defendant did not adequately warn of a particular risk that was known or knowable in light of the generally recognized and prevailing scientific and medical knowledge [*4] available at the time of manufacture and distribution. Bailey v. Janssen Pharmaceutica, Inc., No. 06-80702 CIV, [2006 BL 149897], 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 82811 , 2006 WL 3665417 , at *4 (S.D. Fla. Nov. 14, 2006) (citing Ferayorni v. Hyundai Motor Co., 711 So. 2d 1167 , 1172 (Fla. 4th DCA 1998)). This requires the plaintiff to plead the content of the warning label or otherwise describe the manner in which the warning was inadequate. Bailey v. Janssen Pharmaceutica, Inc., 288 F. App'x 597 , 602 (11th Cir. 2008).
The First Amended Complaint, however, does not identify the content of the warnings in question or adequately present the alleged defects in the warnings. Although Tsavaris maintains that the Wyeth Defendants should have warned that "certain symptoms or family history could lead to breast cancer," of "the symptoms, scope or severity of the potential risk of breast cancer," and "that a safe alternative was available that should be tried first," FAC ¶ 158, she fails to identify what risks the Wyeth Defendants actually warned of, including whether those warnings accompanied the Prempro she received, and exactly how those warnings should have been rewritten to avoid any alleged inaccuracy. As such, Tsavaris has not pleaded enough facts to state a claim under a failure to warn theory.
Tsavaris's attempt to rescue her deficient failure to warn claim fails. Tsavaris relies almost exclusively on the 2005 Prempro label she included with her response, but which she never referenced nor attached to the First Amended Complaint. A plaintiff, though, cannot amend the complaint in a response to a motion to dismiss, for a court's review on dismissal is limited to the four corners of the complaint. See, e.g., St. George v. Pinellas Cnty., 285 F.3d 1334 , 1337 (11th Cir. 2002)). In addition, Tsavaris argues that her failure to warn claim is sufficient by pointing to allegations spread throughout the introductory paragraphs of the First Amended Complaint. She also tries to establish the sufficiency of her claim by relying on allegations asserted in other causes of action but not incorporated by reference into Count III. A shotgun pleading of this sort will not do.
For these reasons, Count III is dismissed without prejudice.
B. Count V (Negligence) Is Dismissed Without Prejudice For Failure To State A Claim 
To state a negligence claim, a "plaintiff must allege (1) a duty or obligation recognized by the law requiring the defendant to protect others from unreasonable risks, (2) a breach of that duty, (3) a reasonably close causal connection between the conduct and the resulting injury, and (4) actual loss or damages." Williams v. Davis, 974 So. 2d 1052 , 1056 (Fla. 2007).
Tsavaris alleges that the Wyeth Defendants owed her a duty of care, which they breached by (1) failing to conduct adequate pre-clinical testing and research to determine the safety of Prempro; (2) failing to conduct adequate post-marketing surveillance to determine the safety and risks of Prempro; (3) failing to warn of the risks of Prempro; and (4) continuing to "dismiss and distract" the consuming public, including Tsavaris, through deceptive marketing and media campaigns designed to downplay the risk of breast cancer associated with Prempro, despite knowing of the significant [*5] risks of breast cancer associated with the product. FAC ¶¶ 173-174.
First, Tsavaris's allegation of inadequate testing and post-market surveillance are problematic, at least as currently pleaded. Under Florida law, a manufacturer's duty to test is a subpart of its duty to design a product with reasonable care and, therefore, is subsumed in the plaintiff's claims for defective design and failure to warn. See, e.g., Adams v. G.D. Searle & Co., Inc., 576 So. 2d 728 (Fla. 2d DCA 1991). On that basis, the Court cannot analyze Tsavaris's inadequate testing allegation as supporting her negligence count, only as corroborating her design defect and failure to warn counts.1 
As for Tsavaris's allegation of insufficient post-market surveillance, the Wyeth Defendants argue that this is effectively a fraud-on-the-FDA claim, which is preempted by federal law. According to the Wyeth Defendants, by alleging that they failed to conduct adequate post-market surveillance of Prempro, Tsavaris is in effect claiming that they misled or defrauded the FDA by providing the agency false information. This position is unavailing. A fraud-on-the-FDA claim, like the name suggests, requires allegations of fraud. See Buckman Co. v. Plaintiffs' Legal Comm., 531 U.S. 341 , 347 , 121 S. Ct. 1012 , 148 L. Ed. 2d 854 (2001). But Tsavaris makes no such accusations. Instead, she asserts what purports to be a purely state law cause of action for negligence.
That alone does not avoid preemption, however. Federal law impliedly preempts state law when state and federal law "conflict"—that is, when "it is impossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal law" or when state law "stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress." PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing, 564 U.S. 604 , 131 S. Ct. 2567 , 2587 , 180 L. Ed. 2d 580 (2011)); see also William Hochul III, Enforcement in Kind: Reexamining the Preemption Doctrine In Arizona v. United States, 87 Notre Dame L. Rev. 2225 (2012). Stated differently, if complying with a state's laws would require a "party to violate federal law," then the state laws "are preempted and, thus, are 'without effect.'" Mut. Pharm. Co. v. Bartlett, 133 S. Ct. 2466 , 2470 , 186 L. Ed. 2d 607 (2013) (citation omitted). So, to present a viable state tort claim that falls outside the scope of federal preemption, Tsavaris would have to allege that (1) the Wyeth Defendants violated a state tort duty and (2) the Wyeth Defendants could have acted in line with their federal obligations while lawfully discharging their state duty. Based on the allegations in the First Amended Complaint, Tsavaris fails to make this showing. That being said, the Court is not ready to dismiss with prejudice her negligence claim based on inadequate post-market surveillance. Tsavaris will have another opportunity to avoid preemption should she choose to file an amended complaint.
Second, Tsavaris's negligence claim based on inadequate warnings fails for the same reasons as her strict products liability failure to warn claim discussed in section III(A)(2) above.
Given these points, and to avoid the piecemeal pleading of claims, the Court will dismiss the entire negligence claim without prejudice so that Tsavaris can amend her complaint to cure the deficiencies [*6] discussed above. See, e.g., Architectural Ingenieria Siglo XXI, LLC v. Dominican Republic, No. 1:13-CV-20544-KMM, [2015 BL 395712], 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 161493 , 2015 WL 7760057 , at *6 (S.D. Fla. Dec. 2, 2015) (dismissing the entire complaint in the interest of judicial economy to exclude certain claims barred under the law of the case doctrine).
For these reasons, Count V is dismissed without prejudice.
C. Count VII (Negligent Misrepresentation) Is Dismissed Without Prejudice For Failure To State A Claim 
A plaintiff may establish negligent misrepresentation by proving (1) a misrepresentation of a material fact; (2) the representor made the representation without knowledge as to its truth or falsity, or under circumstances in which the representor ought to have known of its falsity; (3) the representor intended to induce another to act on the misrepresentation; and (4) injury resulted to the party acting in justifiable reliance on the misrepresentation." Souran v. Travelers Ins. Co., 982 F.2d 1497 , 1503 (11th Cir. 1993) (citation omitted). Negligent misrepresentation, like fraud, must be pleaded with specificity. See, e.g., Chapman v. Abbott Labs., 930 F. Supp. 2d 1321 , 1324 (M.D. Fla. 2013). Adequate pleading of a negligent misrepresentation claim requires allegations of who made the false statement, the substance of the false statement, when the statement was made, and the context in which the statement was made. See Bailey, [2006 BL 149897], 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 82811 , 2006 WL 3665417 , *7.
Tsavaris alleges that the Wyeth Defendants misrepresented material facts regarding the "serious risk of breast cancer . . . on the Prempro label and through their sales force." FAC ¶ 193. One such misrepresentation, according to Tsavaris, is a statement made on the 2012 warning label for Prempro that "studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, doses, or routes of administration." Id. ¶ 196. Tsavaris claims that this was a material misrepresentation because several studies available at the time undermined this assertion. Id. But even if the statement on the 2012 warning label was a material misrepresentation, it was made approximately seven years after Tsavaris last used Prempro. As a result, Tsavaris cannot allege that her physician relied on this statement in prescribing the drug.2 Because Tsavaris is unable to show any justifiable reliance on the alleged misrepresentation, she fails to state a claim for negligent misrepresentation based on the 2012 warning label.
Another misrepresentation Tsavaris cites is a statement on the Prempro package insert that "the risk of breast cancer was 'unknown' and did not exceed that of the general population." FAC ¶ 198. Tsavaris, however, does not specify whether this was the package insert distributed with the Prempro she received from Dr. Schwartzbard. Nor does she state whether Dr. Schwartzbard relied on this statement in prescribing her the drug. By failing to allege critical facts like when the misrepresentation was made, as well as the context in which the statement was made, Tsavaris fails to state a claim for negligent misrepresentation based on the contents of the Prempro package insert.
Like some [*7] of the other causes of action, the Court rejects Tsavaris's shotgun pleading of her negligent misrepresentation claim. Tsavaris tries to cure her inadequate claim by citing introductory paragraph 41 of her 232-paragraph, 79-page complaint, buried in the facts section of the First Amended Complaint and incorporated by reference into Count VII. Again, the Court will not entertain such shotgun pleading.
The Court also rejects Tsavaris's effort to save her claim through her response. Tsavaris points to three statements contained on the 2005 Prempro label, which, together with the allegations set forth under Count VII, she contends make out a negligent misrepresentation claim. The 2005 label, however, was neither referenced in nor attached to the First Amended Complaint. Because a plaintiff cannot amend the complaint when responding to a motion to dismiss, the Court cannot consider the contents of the 2005 Prempro label.
For these reasons, Count VII is dismissed without prejudice.
IV. CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, it is ordered and adjudged that the Wyth Defendants' Motion to Dismiss [D.E. 40] is granted. Counts I, III, V, and VII are dismissed without prejudice.
All pending motions, if any, are denied as moot.3 The Clerk of Court is instructed to close this case.
Done and ordered in Chambers at Miami, Florida, this 1st day of February, 2016.

In Florida, manufacturers of prescription drugs have a duty to warn consumers of known risks or be subject to strict liability for any resulting harm. Dimieri v. Medicis Pharms. Corp., No. 2:14-CV-176-FTM-38, [2014 BL 194052], 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 95409 , 2014 WL 3417364 , at *2 (M.D. Fla. July 14, 2014) (citing Horrillo v. Cook Inc., No. 10-15327, 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 26317 , 2012 WL 6553611 , at *2 (11th Cir. Nov. 7, 2012)). When a physician is involved, however, the physician serves as a learned intermediary between the patient and the manufacturer, and the learned intermediary doctrine might apply. Id . (citing Christopher v. Cutter Labs., 53 F.3d 1184 , 1192 (11th Cir.1995)). Under that doctrine, if the manufacturer properly warns the physician regarding known risks, the manufacturer's duty to warn the consumer is discharged. Id . (citing Christopher, 53 F.3d at 1192 ). But even where the manufacturer fails to warn the physician properly, the learned intermediary doctrine will still discharge the manufacturer's duty to warn if the physician had independent knowledge of the risks associated with the drug. Id . (citing MacMorris v. Wyeth, Inc., 2:04CV596FTM-29DNF, [2005 BL 78026], 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46657 , 2005 WL 1528626 , at *2 (M.D. Fla. June 27, 2005)).

ELIZABETH M. TIMOTHY, UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE.

ELIZABETH M. TIMOTHY 
ORDER and REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
This case has been referred to the undersigned magistrate judge pursuant to the authority of 28 U.S.C. § 636(b) and Local Rules 72.1(A) , 72.2(D) and 72.3 of this court relating to review of administrative determinations under the Social Security Act ("Act") and related statutes, 42 U.S.C. § 401 , et seq. It is now before the court pursuant to 42 U. S.C. § 405(g) of the Act for review of a final determination of the Commissioner of Social Security ("Commissioner") denying Plaintiff's application for disability insurance benefits ("DIB") under Title II of the Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 401-34 .
Upon review of the record before this court, it is the opinion of the undersigned that the findings of fact and determinations of the Commissioner are supported by substantial evidence; thus, the decision of the Commissioner should be affirmed.
I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY
On June 3, 2008, Plaintiff filed an application for DIB and alleged therein disability beginning December 4, 2006 (tr. 34).2 Her application was denied initially and on reconsideration, and Plaintiff then requested a hearing before an administrative law judge ("ALJ"). A hearing was held on January 27, 2011, and on February 14, 2011, the ALJ issued a decision in which he found Plaintiff "not disabled," as defined under the Act, at any time through September 30, 2010, the date Plaintiff was last insured for DIB purposes 3 (tr. 34-41). On November 13, 2012, the Appeals Council denied Plaintiff's request for review (tr. 2), which made the decision of the ALJ the Commissioner's final determination, subject to review in this court. See Poellnitz v. Astrue, 349 F. App'x 500 , 501 (11th Cir. 2009) (unpublished) ("When the ALJ denies benefits and the AC denies review, we generally review the ALJ's decision as the Commissioner's final decision."); see also Ingram v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec., 496 F.3d 1253 , 1262 , 1265-66 (11th Cir. 2007) ("a reviewing court must consider whether that new evidence [submitted to the AC] renders the denial of benefits erroneous"). This appeal followed.
II. FINDINGS OF THE ALJ
The ALJ made the following findings relative to the issues raised in this appeal (tr. 34-41):
a) Plaintiff did not engage in substantial gainful activity during the relevant period.
b) Plaintiff had two severe impairments during the relevant period, back pain status-post lumbar spine compression fracture repair and history of a transient ischemic attack, but she had no impairment or combination of impairments that met or medically equaled one of the impairments listed in 20 C.F.R. Part 404 , Subpart P, Appendix 1.
c) Plaintiff had the residual [*2] functional capacity ("RFC") to perform the full range of sedentary work during the relevant period, and thus she could perform her past relevant work as a customer service representative and, correspondingly, was not disabled.

III. STANDARD OF REVIEW
Review of the Commissioner's final decision is limited to determining whether the decision is supported by substantial evidence and whether the correct legal standards were applied. Wilson v. Barnhart, 284 F.3d 1219 , 1221 (11th Cir. 2002); Lewis v. Callahan, 125 F.3d 1436 , 1439 (11th Cir. 1997). "Substantial evidence is something more than a mere scintilla, but is less than a preponderance," Dyer v. Barnhart, 395 F.3d 1206 , 1210 (11th Cir. 2005) (quotation marks and citations omitted), and "is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion." Crawford v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec., 363 F.3d 1155 , 1158 (11th Cir. 2004) (quotation marks and citations omitted). "Even if the evidence preponderates against the Commissioner's findings," the Commissioner's decision must be affirmed if it is supported by substantial evidence.  Id. at 1158-59 (quotation marks and citations omitted). "The court need not determine whether it would have reached a different result based upon the record," Barnes v. Sullivan, 932 F.2d 1356 , 1358 (11th Cir. 1991), and should not substitute its judgment for that of the Commissioner. Walden v. Schweiker, 672 F.2d 835 , 838 (11th Cir. 1982).
A claimant applying for disability benefits must prove she is disabled. 20 C.F.R. § 404.1512 ; Moore v. Barnhart, 405 F.3d 1208 , 1211 (11th Cir. 2005). The Social Security Regulations outline a five-step sequential evaluation process for determining whether a claimant is disabled. 20 C.F.R. § 404.1520 ; Jones v. Apfel, 190 F.3d 1224 , 1228 (11th Cir. 1999). At the first step, the claimant must show that she has not engaged in substantial gainful activity. Jones, 190 F.3d at 1228 . At the second step, she must prove she has a severe impairment or combination of impairments. At step three, if her impairment meets or equals a listed impairment, she is automatically found disabled. If her impairment does not meet or equal a listed impairment, she must prove, at step four, that she is unable to perform her past relevant work. Finally, if a claimant proves she cannot perform her past relevant work, the burden shifts to the Commissioner at step five to show that there is other work available in significant numbers in the national economy that the claimant is able to perform.

IV. PLAINTIFF'S PERSONAL, EMPLOYMENT, AND MEDICAL HISTORY
A. Personal and Employment History
Plaintiff was born on August 14, 1954 (tr. 190), and was between the ages of fifty-two and fifty-six during the relevant period. She has a high school education and past relevant work as a customer service representative, which she performed at a sedentary level of exertion, and home health aide, which she performed at a medium level of exertion (tr. 50-51).
During her hearing before the ALJ, Plaintiff generally testified that she experiences disabling pain, limitations, and other symptoms due to a lower back injury (see tr. 51-77). When asked what might prevent her return to work as a customer service representative, Plaintiff indicated that she would have difficulty driving to the job and, once there, [*3] concentrating and dealing with people due to a loss of concentration (tr. 68-69). In response to later questioning, Plaintiff testified that if "it weren't for [her] back and leg problems" she would be able to work, although the later questioning concerned work in general, not specifically her work as a customer service representative (see tr. 75).
B. Relevant Medical History
On December 4, 2006, Plaintiff was attempting to lift a patient off the floor at work when she "felt and heard a 'pop' in her back" and began to experience severe pain (tr. 395). She was transported to an emergency room where "unremarkable" x-rays of the lumbar spine were obtained, and Plaintiff was evaluated, treated conservatively, and released (tr. 393, 395). The following day Plaintiff presented to Merle Stringer, M.D., with complaints of lower back pain without radiation, numbness, weakness, paresthesia, or bladder dysfunction (tr. 395). On examination, Dr. Stringer noted thoracic and lumbar paravertebral muscle spasm, moderate limitation of back flexion and extension secondary to non-radicular pain, and tenderness to palpation over both sacroiliac ("SI") joints and the facet joints, bilaterally, at L4-5 and L5-S1 (tr. 394). A straight leg raising ("SLR") test produced some mild lower back pain (tr. 393), but otherwise the examination was normal (see id. (reflecting in relevant part normal lower extremity strength, hip flexion and extension, deep tendon reflexes, and gait)). Additionally, computerized tomography ("CT") of the lumbar spine, obtained December 6, 2006, revealed minimal lumbar spondylosis with diffuse osteopenia but no definite disc herniation or spinal stenosis (tr. 391-92). Dr. Stringer restricted Plaintiff from work for at least one week; assessed status post lifting type injury, low back pain with no evidence of lumbar nerve root compression or cauda equina compression, SI joint tenderness, and bilateral lumbar facet irritation at L4-5 and L5-S1; referred Plaintiff for physical therapy ("PT"); and prescribed pain medication (tr. 393).
Plaintiff returned to Dr. Stringer's office on December 12, 2006, and saw Douglas L. Stringer, M.D. (tr. 388).4 She reported continued back pain and stated she had not yet started PT (tr. 390). Plaintiff's physical examination was essentially the same as before, as were the diagnoses assessed by Dr. Stringer (see tr. 389-90). Dr. Stringer advised Plaintiff to begin PT as soon as possible and stated she should remain off work (tr. 389).5 
On January 11, 2007, upon referral by Dr. Springer, Plaintiff underwent magnetic resonance imaging ("MRI") of the lumbar spine (tr. 385). The MRI revealed a compression deformity of L5 with a height loss of approximately 20% and "an interval development of an annular tear" at L4-5 (tr. 386). After reviewing the MRI and examining Plaintiff, Dr. Stringer prescribed a lumbar brace and scheduled a whole body scan (tr. 382), which Plaintiff obtained on January 23, 2007 (tr. 380). The scan revealed an "uptake in [the] lower lumbar spine," which was consistent with degenerative disease (at L4-5 and L5-S1)( id.). Plaintiff continued to treat with Dr. Stringer from January through [*4] March 2007, and based on Plaintiff's continued complaints of pain Dr. Stringer administered lumbar facet injections at L4-5 and L5-S1 (see, e.g., tr. 376, 378). Dr. Stringer also prescribed Lortab for pain and Zanaflex for muscle spasm (tr. 370, 378). On February 20, 2007, Plaintiff reported that the injections initially improved her pain, but the pain had recurred (tr. 375). She underwent additional injections, and Dr. Stringer recommended that Plaintiff return to work with "no heavy lifting" (tr. 374; see also tr. 371, 363, 356, reflecting additional injections in March, April, and May 2007).
A lumbosacral spine x-ray was obtained on April 4, 2007, and revealed an irregularity at L5 (tr. 367), as was seen on the January 2007 MRI (i.e., the compression deformity) and which appeared to be unchanged since the MRI (see tr. 365). And a thoracic spine CT was obtained on April 27, 2007 (tr. 357). The CT revealed kyphosis and likely osteopenia but no evidence of an acute compression fracture, metastatic disease, or spinal stenosis ( id.). Also in April 2007, Dr. Stringer examined Plaintiff and noted some evidence of paravertebral muscle spasm and moderate limitation of back flexion and extension, secondary to non-radicular lower back pain, but Plaintiff exhibited full strength in her lower extremities, normal sensation, equal and symmetrical deep tendon reflexes, negative Babinski testing, and a normal gait (tr. 365).
On May 3, 2007, Dr. Stringer performed an open reduction and internal fixation of the compression fracture at L5, with kyphoplasty (tr. 354). The surgical report indicates that a kyphoplasty balloon was inserted and expanded at two different areas on the left and right side of L5 and that at each area Dr. Stringer was able to achieve some movement of the end plate to a more normal position ( id.). Additionally, the void created by the balloon was successfully filled, with no extrusion of the cement material within the canal ( id.). Plaintiff was discharged from the hospital the following day (tr. 352).
Plaintiff returned to Dr. Stringer for follow-up on May 15, 2007, and reported "significant improvement" in her symptoms, although she was not totally pain free (tr. 352).6 She also reported some numbness in her feet but denied difficulty with ambulation ( id.). Examination revealed some muscle spasm and moderate limitation of back flexion and extension, secondary to pain, which was localized in Plaintiff's lower back and described as non-radicular (tr. 351).
On May 17, 2007, Plaintiff presented to an emergency room with complaints of back and leg pain (see tr. 316). Lumbosacral spine x-rays revealed degenerative disc disease ("DDD") at L5-S1, the vertebral repair at L5, and mild degenerative changes of the articular facets (tr. 349). She returned to Dr. Stringer one week later and reported pain in her back and lower extremities, paresthesia in the lower extremities, and "increasing difficulty" since the kyphoplasty (tr. 348). Upon examination, Dr. Stringer noted moderate tenderness of the lumbar spine, limitation of forward bending to 70% of normal, and back pain with SLR tests (tr. 347). Sensory examination [*5] showed spotty loss of sensation to pinprick in both feet and a limping gait ( id.). Dr. Stringer prescribed a course of steroids, Lyrica, and Flexeril and instructed Plaintiff to increase her Lortab dosage to one every six hours for pain ( id.). On June 1, 2007, Plaintiff saw Dr. Stringer and stated she was "much better" with the steroids but had experienced an increase in pain in her back and legs, with leg numbness, when she tried to do laundry (tr. 346). The results of Dr. Stringer's examination were similar to those obtained in late May (compare tr. 345 with tr. 347). Dr. Stringer assessed lumbar disc disease causing low back and leg pain with paresthesias of the lower extremities, some evidence suggestive of nerve root irritation and/or compression, "some increasing difficulty after doing some laundry work," and history of L5 kyphoplasty with "significant improvement in her bone pain from the compression fracture[]" (tr. 345). Dr. Stringer prescribed Lortab, to be taken once every twelve hours for pain, and Lyrica, and he scheduled additional testing (i.e., a lumbar MRI and electromyogram and nerve conduction velocity ("EMG-NCV") studies) pending authorization by the workers' compensation insurer (tr. 344).
On June 13, 2007, Plaintiff reported that she was "much better" (tr. 344). More specifically, she reported that she was walking more and experiencing less back pain, leg pain, and paresthesia ( id.). Aphysical examination was generally the same, and Dr. Stringer continued—but increased the dosage of—the Lyrica (tr. 342). Dr. Stringer's diagnoses remained the same ( id.).
The EMG-NCV testing was conducted on June 19, 2007. The NCV study, which was of the lower extremities, was normal (tr. 306), but the EMG was "suspicious for [or consistent with] L5-S1 radiculopathy" (tr. 336, 306). The lumbar spine MRI was obtained on June 26, 2007, and revealed minimally bulging disc material at the lower three lumbar levels with no focal disc abnormality, nerve root impingement/compression, or spinal stenosis (tr. 337, 340).7 Plaintiff exhibited some evidence of paravertebral muscle spasm and moderate limitation of back flexion and extension secondary to pain (tr. 337).
On July 26, 2007, Plaintiff saw Dr. Stringer and reported "very little pain in her back" but some parethesia at the S1 area, bilaterally, worse on the right (tr. 335). Plaintiff also stated she was walking more but doing so caused some increased back pain ( id.). Dr. Stringer advised Plaintiff to increase her activity, stay off work for two more weeks, and then return to light duty work with lifting of no more than twenty pounds (tr. 333). On August 27, 2007, Plaintiff reported ongoing pain and muscle spasm in her back, worse with increased activity, as well as occasional paresthesias of her left leg ( id.). Dr. Stringer noted that Plaintiff had "good" pain relief with medication and an "adequate" activity level (tr. 330). In late September 2007, after Plaintiff had apparently resumed PT, she told Dr. Stringer that PT was making her symptoms worse, and she complained of back, leg, and foot pain with numbness in the feet (tr. 329). Following a physical examination, which yielded [*6] largely the same results as prior examinations (see tr. 328), Dr. Stringer advised Plaintiff there were no available neurosurgical treatment options and, from a "neurosurgical standpoint, she ha[d] reached maximum medical improvement" ("MMI") with an 8% impairment rating "based on the Florida Impairment Guidelines," with 5% based on the compression fracture at L5 and 3% for the back spasms and "loss of mobility" (tr. 327-28). He also noted that Plaintiff would be referred for a functional capacity assessment ("FCA"),8 and he released Plaintiff "to return to work at light duty" (see tr. 327).
On October 19, 2007, Plaintiff saw Mark Akerson, M.D., a family care physician, and complained of lower back swelling with pain and numbness from the knees through the feet (tr. 451). Upon examination, Plaintiff had mild lower lumbar pain and some spasm, as well as limited range of motion and pain with movement ( id). Dr. Akerson assessed back pain, weakness, and numbness, and he prescribed medication for inflammation (meloxicam and Flexeril) but noted Plaintiff would need to get prescriptions for Lyrica and Lortab from a workers' compensation physician ( id.).
On January 30, 2008, Plaintiff presented to the Tallahasee Neurological Clinic, P.A., and primarily complained of back pain, which she stated began on December 4, 2006, and foot pain, which reportedly began on May 3, 2007 (see tr. 409). She stated that the May 2007 kyphoplasty worsened her back pain and coincided with the onset of the pain, numbness, and/or tingling in her lower extremities ( id.). Joshua Fuhrmeister, M.D., noted that Plaintiff was taking Lortab and Lyrica, and that according to Plaintiff her medications relieved 70% of her pain (tr. 414). Upon examination, Plaintiff had a mildly antalgic gait but a normal station, minimal lumbar spine tenderness, and (as reported by Plaintiff) pain with range of motion (tr. 418). SLR testing was negative, and strength and sensation in the lower extremities were normal ( id.). Dr. Fuhrmeister opined that "the etiology of her ongoing low back pain and leg pain is unclear" ( id.). He assessed low back pain, closed lumbar fracture, and lumbar radiculopathy, and he discussed with Plaintiff possible treatment options, including increased use of Lyrica and a lumbar epidural steroid injection ("ESI") (tr. 418-19). Plaintiff chose the latter option (and the ESI was administered in early February 2008) (tr. 418, 420). Dr. Fuhrmeister also completed workers' compensation forms (hereafter "WC forms") and opined—by checking boxes—that Plaintiff had not yet reached MMI and was not able to perform even sedentary exertional activities (tr. 413). Plaintiff returned to Dr. Fuhrmeister on February 26, 2008 (tr. 423). She complained of back pain and leg weakness, and she stated that the ESI had not helped and that her pain had actually increased following the ESI ( id.). A physical examination was largely normal. More specifically, strength and sensation were normal in the upper and lower extremities; Plaintiff's station was normal; SLR tests were negative, bilaterally, as was rotation of the hips; and Plaintiff had only minimal lumbar tenderness [*7] over the paraspinal muscles ( id.). The only abnormalities noted were a mildly antalgic gait and, per Plaintiff's report, pain with lumbar movement ( id.). Dr. Fuhrmeister again stated that the etiology of her back pain was unclear, and he could not explain the symptoms Plaintiff reported following the ESI (tr. 427). He ordered a MRI and noted that Plaintiff was poor surgical candidate, "[r]egardless of what the MRI shows" ( id.). Dr. Fuhrmeister also filled out additional WC forms (tr. 421-22). On these forms, Dr. Fuhrmeister did not opine—by checking boxes or otherwise—that Plaintiff had not yet reached MMI or was unable to perform even sedentary exertional activities (see tr. 422, reflecting that Dr. Fuhrmeister failed to respond to the questions in this regard).
Plaintiff obtained the lumbar MRI on March 17, 2008 (tr. 428). It revealed spondylosis at L3-4 through L5-S1, the prior vertebral healed fracture with vertebroplasty at L5, and dehydration and shrinkage of the L4-5 discs, but no evidence of root effects at any of these levels ( id.).
Plaintiff returned to Dr. Fuhrmeister on March 26, 2008 (tr. 431). Dr. Fuhrmeister's treatment notes are essentially the same as those from Plaintiff's earlier visits, with the exception of his diagnoses and notes as to Plaintiff's complaints. With regard to the diagnoses, after review of the recent MRI Dr. Fuhrmeister no longer assessed lumbar radiculopathy (see tr. 434-35). With regard to Plaintiff's complaints, on this occasion she reported additional symptoms of headaches, fingernail changes, and skin color changes at the feet (tr. 435). Dr. Fuhrmeister again stated he could not explain Plaintiff's symptoms ( id.). Additionally, he opined that Plaintiff was at MMI from a pain management perspective, and he adopted the restrictions from the FCA (see id.), which—as explained infra—are for sedentary work. Plaintiff returned on May 23, 2008, and advised Dr. Fuhrmeister that if "she was not taking the medication [i.e., Lortab and Lyrica] she would be in severe pain" (tr. 438). The treatment notes reflect complaints of ongoing low back and leg pain, which Plaintiff described as "severe with prolonged driving"; she also complained of lower extremity muscle spasm (tr. 441). Dr. Fuhrmeister discussed with Plaintiff adding a muscle relaxant to her medication regimen, but Plaintiff declined ( id.). He assessed low back pain (but not lumbar radiculopathy), continued Plaintiff's other medications, and advised her to return in two months ( id.).
On May 28, 2008, Plaintiff returned to Dr. Akerson (tr. 454). She told Dr. Akerson she had fallen due to weakness in her legs, and she hurt her ribs in the fall and had chest pain ( id.). Dr. Akerson prescribed a chest x-ray and medication ( id.). Plaintiff returned in June 2008 and again complained of chest pain, as well as numbness in her left arm (tr. 455). Dr. Akerson administered an electrocardiogram ("EKG") and assessed non-cardiac chest pain (tr. 455-56). On July 15, 2008, Plaintiff returned to Dr. Akerson's office with "disability papers from her back pain [sic] and lower ext[remity] weakness" and asked that the "paperwork [be] filled out by Dr. Akerson" (tr. 501). Dr. [*8] Akerson indicated that he filled out the paperwork (as described next), and he noted that "subjectively" Plaintiff was in a lot of pain and unable to get comfortable ( id.). Dr. Akerson also examined Plaintiff and noted positive SLR tests, bilaterally, and limited leg range of motion with pain, bilaterally ( id.). He assessed lumbar disc disease and back pain ( id.).
On July 15, 2008, Dr. Akerson completed a form outlining Plaintiff's physical limitations, which form is presumably part of the disability paperwork mentioned in his treatment record (see tr. 458-61). He opined that Plaintiff was limited to lifting, carrying, or pulling less than ten pounds; standing no more than two hours in an eight-hour workday; and sitting less than five minutes in an eight-hour workday 9 (tr. 458-59). Dr. Akerson explained that these limitations were assessed in light of Plaintiff's compression fracture at L5 (tr. 459). With regard to postural limitations, Dr. Akerson opined that Plaintiff could occasionally (i.e., up to one-third of an eight-hour workday) crawl or stoop, but she could never climb, balance, kneel, or crouch ( id.). In explaining these opinions, Dr. Akerson stated, "[Plaintiff] has severe pain (subjective) when doing above [postural] activities." ( id.). Although Dr. Akerson assessed no manipulative limitations, when asked to explain the basis for assessing any such limitations he noted, "[Plaintiff] drops all items since injury per [Plaintiff]." (tr. 460). Next, Dr. Akerson assessed a variety of environmental limitations, including restrictions regarding exposure to temperature extremes, vibrations, machinery, heights, fumes, odors, chemicals, and gases; when asked to explain these limitations he stated, "[Plaintiff must refrain from] any climbing or walking due to fall risk." (tr. 461). Continuing, Dr. Akerson opined that Plaintiff would be absent from work more than three times a month ( id.). Finally, Dr. Akerson stated that the limitations he assessed apply from "12/4/06 to ?" ( id.). Also in July 2008, Dr. Akerson completed a form titled Assistive Device Questionnaire (tr. 463). In pertinent part, he indicated on this form that Plaintiff occasionally used a cane for ambulation and that the cane was medically necessary, but he also indicated that Plaintiff could walk and stand without it ( id.). Additionally, in response to a question that asks, "When is the walker/can[e] medically necessary," Dr. Akerson stated, "N/A" ( id.).
Plaintiff returned to Dr. Fuhrmeister on July 23, 2008, with complaints of low back pain and swelling, tenderness in her upper back, and numbness and burning, bilaterally, in the lower extremities (tr. 581). A physical examination was essentially unremarkable, revealing "grossly normal extremity strength" and intact sensation, with only mild tenderness in the lumbar and thoracic muscles (but no evidence of spasm) and a mildly antalgic gait (tr. 583). Dr. Fuhrmeister assessed low back pain and opined that Plaintiff's upper back pain was most likely due to deconditioning (tr. 584). He prescribed home exercises, Flexeril, Lyrica, and Lidoderm patches for back pain (tr. 584, 586). Plaintiff returned to Dr. Fuhrmeister [*9] in September and December 2008, and his treatment records from these visits are generally the same as his earlier, but recent, records (tr. 586-93). Of note, in September Plaintiff complained of right leg numbness and swelling in the feet, and Dr. Fuhrmeister opined that the swelling was not related to her work injury and thus Plaintiff would have to seek treatment for it elsewhere (i.e., from her primary care physician) (tr. 586, 589). And in December Plaintiff complained of headaches and similar symptoms as before but stated that, overall, her medication regimen was "working well" (tr. 590).
Plaintiff returned to Dr. Akerson in January 2009 (tr. 502). She reported swelling in the hands, feet, and face, as well as pain in the feet at night (tr. 503). She also stated she was smoking two pack of cigarettes daily, and Dr. Akerson noted a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ("COPD") (tr. 502). Plaintiff made no complaints of back pain, although a history of "pain management" is noted in the treatment record, and Dr. Akerson assessed no back-related diagnoses; he diagnosed only a vitamin deficiency and a possible allergic reaction (see tr. 502-03).
Plaintiff returned to Dr. Fuhrmeister on three occasions in 2009 (tr. 594-606).10 Plaintiff's complaints were generally the same as before (see tr. 594, 598, 602), although she reported additional complaints in March (tr. 594 (pain behind the knees)), June (tr. 598 (sleep difficulties)), and October (tr. 602) (wrist pain)). Plaintiff's physical examinations were also generally the same (i.e., normal extremity strength and sensation (tr. 597), mildly antalgic gait (tr. 597, 600; see also tr. 604, noting same but indicating that Plaintiff was using a cane). Dr. Fuhrmeister, however, noted no musculoskeletal abnormalities during these visits (see tr. 597, 600, 604). Dr. Fuhrmeister's diagnosis (i.e., back pain) remained the same, as did his course of treatment/prescriptions, generally (see tr. 597, 601, 605). Plaintiff returned to Dr. Fuhrmeister in April 2010. The treatment notes are basically the same (see tr. 606-09), although on this occasion Dr. Fuhrmeister advised Plaintiff she need not return for six months (tr. 609) (as can be seen supra, Dr. Fuhrmeister previously scheduled shorter intervals).
Plaintiff returned to Dr. Akerson in May 2010 with complaints of nausea and other symptoms, none of which related to her back, and a physical examination was essentially normal (see tr. 550-51).
Plaintiff was hospitalized from July 14 through July 16, 2010, after complaining of right-sided weakness and face numbness, preceded by a month of "on and off' headaches (tr. 576). An EKG was normal (tr. 561), and Plaintiff was assessed with transient ischemic attack ("TIA") (see tr. 576). She returned to the hospital on July 18, 2010, and reported weakness in all extremities and difficulty with speech (tr. 569).11 Plaintiff also complained of intermittent headaches, extreme nausea (but no vomiting), and visual disturbances ( id.). Plaintiff reported a thirty-year history of smoking a pack of cigarettes daily, and chest x-rays suggested COPD (tr. 578).12 A magnetic resonance angiography ("MRA") of the brain showed a narrowing [*10] of the right anterior cerebral artery at its origin (tr. 574). Plaintiff was discharged on July 21 with a diagnosis of TIA and narrowing of the right anterior cerebral artery (tr. 572). She was urged to quit smoking in order to reduce the chance of another TIA ( id.). On July 22, 2010, Plaintiff advised Dr. Akerson that she had no problems since she was treated for the TIA and discharged from the hospital (tr. 554).
Plaintiff returned to Dr. Fuhrmeister on October 22, 2010 (which was after her date last insured (9/30/10) for DIB purposes), and reported increased pain since a fall in September (tr. 613). She also reported more frequent leg numbness, and she had an antalgic and shuffling gait ( id.). Plaintiff stated that although Lortab was effective, she was only allowed to take one a day and therefore was unable to remain active throughout the day (tr. 614). Dr. Fuhrmeister adjusted her dosage to twice a day ( id.). He also noted that Plaintiff's workers' compensation case had settled, and he assessed low back pain and advised Plaintiff to return in six months (tr. 613-14).
A December 14, 2010, brain MRI revealed only an insignificant abnormality (see tr. 565). Similarly, a MRA of the brain obtained the same day resulted in the following impression: "stable minimal narrowing of the proximal left ICA [internal carotid artery], likely of no significance. Otherwise, unremarkable MRA." (tr. 624). Finally, a lumbar spine MRI obtained the same day revealed the old compression fracture and repair, as well as a slight posterior protrusion of the bone of the compressed vertebra but no evidence of stenosis (tr. 567-68). The MRI report also notes, "findings are questionable regarding nerve root compression, but it is possible that there is compression of the descending nerve roots" at L4-5, related to ligament hypertrophy and the slightly protruding disc, which also resulted in a reduction of the spinal canal area (tr. 568).
On December 28, 2010, Plaintiff saw neurologist Karin Maddox, M.D., for follow up as to the recent MRI and MRA, as well as a pain management assessment (tr. 618).13 Upon examination, Plaintiff was tender to palpation over the lumbar spine with paravertebral muscle spasm, trigger point tenderness, and decreased range of motion ( id.). Dr. Maddox noted that Plaintiff's gait was antalgic and she used a cane for ambulation (tr. 617). Otherwise, Plaintiff's examination was largely unremarkable (see tr. 617-18). Dr. Maddox diagnosed a history of TIA, migraines, and lumbar radiculopathy, and she continued Plaintiff's medications and referred Plaintiff for lumbar facet injections (tr. 617).
C. Evidence and Opinions from Non-Treating Sources
On October 2, 2007, upon referral from Dr. Stringer, Terra R. Towne, MOT, OTR, conducted a FCA (tr. 311-15). Ms. Towne observed Plaintiff perform a series of tasks—such as lifting, carrying, pushing, pulling, sitting, standing, walking, climbing, and balancing—in order to determine Plaintiff's physical capacities, including the amount of weight she could lift, carry, push, or pull, and the length of time she could sit, stand, or walk (see tr. 313). Ms. Towne noted that Plaintiff "self-limited" [*11] on five of the fourteen tasks (or approximately 36% of the tasks) she was asked to perform (tr. 313, 315). Ms. Towne then explained that, in general, self-limiting behavior on less than 20% of the tasks is normal, when compared with motivated individuals; but self-limiting behavior on 21 to 33% of the tasks exceeds normal limits, and self-limiting behavior on more than 33% of the tasks—as Plaintiff did—significantly exceeds normal limits (tr. 315 (citing research conducted by the University of Alabama at Birmingham and reported in the Journal of Occupational Medicine, Sept. 1994)). Ms. Towne noted that Plaintiff previously performed her work as a home health aide at a medium level of exertion but, based on Plaintiff's performance on the tasks, she could not return to such work. Rather, Ms. Towne opined, Plaintiff could perform only sedentary work (tr. 311, 315). Ms. Towne specifically noted, however, that her opinion was "significantly influenced by [Plaintiff's] self-limiting behavior" and that the restriction to sedentary work indicated Plaintiff's "minimal rather than her maximal ability" (tr. 315). She also noted that Plaintiff's self-limiting behavior prevented an opinion as to Plaintiff's maximum capacities ( id.).
On August 30, 2008, Plaintiff was examined by Adam Berliner, D.O., at the Commissioner's request (tr. 465-70). Plaintiff reported back pain and numbness that radiated into both legs and feet, as well as lower extremity weakness (tr. 465). She explained that the pain was intermittent but present most days and precipitated by activities of daily living, such as taking clothes out of the dryer, mopping, driving, and dressing ( id.). She alleged that her pain increased with activity, but rest, medication, and use of a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ("TENS") unit helped alleviate it ( id.). Plaintiff reported that she occasionally used a cane for ambulation, but she was not using one at the time of Dr. Berliner's examination and did not need one to ambulate independently (tr. 465-66). Upon examination, Dr. Berliner noted that Plaintiff did not demonstrate pain behaviors, exhibit any difficulties getting on and off the examining table, or "appear acutely ill" (tr. 466). Dr. Berliner did note tenderness to palpation at L5-S1 and in the lower lumbar paraspinal muscles and bilateral SI joints, but a Patrick's test and SLR tests were negative bilaterally, and Plaintiff had full muscle strength in the upper and lower extremities, bilaterally (tr. 467). Plaintiff had an altered posture and some limits in range of motion with flexion and extension of the lumbar spine (see tr. 467-68). Range of motion was full, however, in all other areas tested, including the cervical spine, shoulders, hands, hips, knees, and ankles (see tr. 468-70). Additionally, Plaintiff could toe-walk and tandem-walk but had minor difficulty heel-walking, bilaterally, and could not squat (tr. 467). Dr. Bernliner diagnosed a compression fracture at L5, status post kyphoplasty ( id.).
On September 23, 2008, a non-examining agency physician, P.S. Krishnamurthy, M.D., opined that Plaintiff could perform work at the light level [*12] of exertion (see tr. 485-92).
On January 16, 2009, at the Commissioner's request, Plaintiff presented to Iqbal Faruqui, M.D., for a consultative examination (tr. 494-97). Plaintiff described her injury, pain, limitations, and course of treatment (tr. 494-95), and Dr. Faruqui reviewed the results of Plaintiff's previous consultative examination by Dr. Berliner (see tr. 496). He then examined Plaintiff. He noted mild diffuse tenderness of the paraspinal muscles with no significant spasm and no spinal column point tenderness (tr. 497). Plaintiff had full ranges of motion in all areas tested except with lumber extension and flexion, which were slightly reduced ( id.). Plaintiff could not squat, and her gait was slightly antalgic ( id.). A SLR test was negative for low back pain but reportedly caused "some pulling in [the] right foot" ( id.). Finally, Dr. Faruqui noted that deep tendon reflexes were normal, as was Plaintiff's ability to tandem-walk, grip with full strength, and perform fine manipulation ( id.). He assessed history of chronic back pain secondary to a compression fracture ( id.). In closing, Dr. Faruqui stated that Plaintiff's examination was "generally unremarkable except that she looks uncomfortable all the time and somewhat anxious, depressed and irritable," and he noted that Plaintiff walked without an assistive device ( id.).
On February 7, 2009, a second non-examining agency physician, Janet Gibson, D.O., opined Plaintiff could perform light exertional activity with the ability to alternate between sitting and standing (see tr. 505-12).
D. Evidence Submitted to the Appeals Council (but not considered by the ALJ)
On February 28, 2011, Plaintiff submitted a letter from Dr. Maddox to the Appeals Council in conjunction with her request for review (tr. 285). In the letter Dr. Maddox noted Plaintiff's diagnosis of "severe degenerative disc disease resulting in chronic low and mid back pain with radiculopathy into [the] lower extremities," and in support of this diagnosis she referenced MRI results and findings on examination ( id.).14 She stated Plaintiff was being treated with pain medications and bilateral lumbar facet injections with "some success" but noted that Plaintiff's "condition has proven to be permanent and progressive" ( id.). She also stated that Plaintiff's use of a cane was medically necessary "due to episodes of leg buckling and imbalance from the radiculopathy" ( id.). Dr. Maddox also noted she had reviewed records from Dr. Stringer and "more recent [but unidentified] notes" and—apparently based on that review—opined that Plaintiff is capable of working at "no more than the sedentary level," which she described as lifting no more than ten pounds and "standing/walking no more than a total of 2 hours in an 8 hour day" ( id.). Continuing, Dr. Maddox opined that Plaintiff would likely "experience an increase in pain with prolonged upright sitting, computer use, etc., and as a result she may often be incapable of completing a full 8 hour day" ( id.). Thus, Dr. Maddox opined, Plaintiff would be more suited for part time work (i.e., four to six hours a day), with a sit/stand option and, ideally, flexible [*13] hours ( id.). Finally, Dr. Maddox opined that the limitations she assessed were applicable as of at least October 2, 2007, the date of Ms. Towne's FCA ( id.).
V. DISCUSSION
In this appeal, Plaintiff alleges the ALJ erred by: (1) finding her less than fully credible; and (2) adopting the opinions of non-examining agency physicians and Ms. Towne, an occupational therapist, over those of Plaintiff's treating physicians. She also contends the Appeals Council erred in denying her request for review.
A. ALJ's Credibility Determination
After considering the medical evidence of record and Plaintiff's complaints of pain and other symptoms, the ALJ concluded that Plaintiff's medically determinable impairments could reasonably be expected to cause the symptoms she alleges, but her statements concerning the intensity, persistence, and limiting effects of those symptoms are not credible to the extent they are inconsistent with her RFC (that is, for the full range of sedentary work) (tr. 37, 39, 40).15 Plaintiff contends the ALJ erred in making this finding and asserts, in relevant part, that the ALJ failed to consider significant medical evidence of record, made erroneous findings, and/or failed to sufficiently explain his findings (doc. 19 at 1, 16-20).
In Holt v. Sullivan, 921 F.2d 1221 , 1223 (11th Cir. 1991), the Eleventh Circuit articulated the "pain standard," which applies when a disability claimant attempts to establish a disability through her own testimony of pain or other subjective symptoms. The pain standard requires: (1) evidence of an underlying medical condition and either (a) objective medical evidence that confirms the severity of the alleged pain arising from that condition, or (b) that the objectively determined medical condition is of such a severity that it can be reasonably expected to give rise to the alleged pain. Holt, 921 F.2d at 1223 (internal citation omitted). If a claimant testifies as to her subjective complaints of disabling pain and other symptoms, as Plaintiff did here, the ALJ must clearly "articulate explicit and adequate reasons" for discrediting the claimant's allegations of completely disabling symptoms. Foote v. Chater, 67 F.3d 1553 , 1561-62 (11th Cir. 1995). Additionally, "'[a]lthough this circuit does not require an explicit finding as to credibility, . . . the implication must be obvious to the reviewing court.'"  Id. at 1562 (quoting Tieniber v. Heckler, 720 F.2d 1251 , 1255 (11th Cir. 1983)). The credibility determination need not cite "'particular phrases or formulations,'" but it cannot merely be a broad rejection which is "not enough to enable [the court] to conclude that [the ALJ] considered her medical condition as a whole.'" Id . (quoting Jamison v. Bowen, 814 F.2d 585 , 588-90 (11th Cir. 1987)).
Here, the ALJ first articulated the correct pain standard (see tr. 37). He then identified various reasons for discounting Plaintiff's complaints of disabling pain and limitations. First, the ALJ found that the objective medical evidence of record does not support Plaintiff's allegations (tr. 37). In support, he pointed to the CT scan of the lumbar spine, which Plaintiff obtained two days after the fall at work, which showed only minimal spondylosis with [*14] diffuse osteopenia (tr. 37). The ALJ acknowledged that subsequent testing, including a MRI and x-rays from January and April of 2007, revealed a compression fracture, but the ALJ also noted that Plaintiff underwent an open reduction and internal fixation of the fracture, with kyphoplasty, in May 2007 to address these abnormalities (see id.). Thereafter, objective tests obtained during the relevant period (i.e., on or before September 30, 2010) were largely unremarkable, including lumbosacral x-rays in late May 2007, which revealed only mild degenerative changes; a normal NCV study in June 2007; a lumbar MRI from June 2007, which revealed minimal findings; and the lumbar MRI from March 2008, which revealed some spondylosis but no evidence of root effects. In light of this evidence, the ALJ did not err in concluding that diagnostic tests, such as MRIs and x-rays, do not substantiate Plaintiff's complaints of ongoing, constant, and disabling back pain and other symptoms.
Plaintiff nevertheless contends that the ALJ erred because he cited a negative test result (i.e., the Patrick's test result) in support of his credibility findings, but—Plaintiff contends—the results of the Patrick's test do not undermine her complaints (doc. 19 at 17). Plaintiff also argues that the ALJ failed to mention "the numerous positive [SLR] tests, indicating nerve root compression [and other 'significant abnormalities' ] and supporting Plaintiff's allegations," and failed to mention the abnormal EMG study (doc. 19 at 17-18). Plaintiff's arguments are not persuasive. Initially, with regard to the Patrick's test, the ALJ accurately described Dr. Berliner's findings. To illustrate, Dr. Berliner's report states, specifically with regard to his examination of Plaintiff's spine: "[Plaintiff] has tenderness to palpation in the midline at L5-S1 region and in the lower lumbar paraspinals. She also has tenderness to palpation in the bilateral sacral iliac joints. However, Patrick's test was negative bilaterally." (tr. 467). And the ALJ stated, with regard to Dr. Berliner's examination, "[Plaintiff] displayed tenderness to palpation in the midline at L5-S1 region and in the lower lumbar paraspinals, as well as tenderness to palpation in the bilateral sacral iliac. However, Patrick's test was negative bilaterally." (tr. 38). Thus, the ALJ did not err in considering the negative Patrick's test as part of his overall evaluation of Plaintiff's spinal condition and complaints of pain and numbness/weakness in the lower extremities.16 With regard to SLR tests, Plaintiff claims the ALJ failed to consider "numerous" positive SLR tests, but the record does not support a finding that there were indeed numerous positive SLR tests. For example, in her memorandum Plaintiff references the following notations in Dr. Stringer's treatment records: (1) SLR tests that produced some mild low back pain at 75 degrees in December 2006 and May and June 2007; (2) SLR tests that caused low back pain "with no true radicular component" in May 2007; and (3) various SLR tests conducted between December 2006 and August 2007 (i.e., before [*15] or within a few months of Plaintiff's surgery) that were simply noted to cause pain (doc. 19 at 2-7, citing tr. 393, 351, 337, 347, 345, 342, 334, 331). None of these SLR tests, however, were specifically described as "positive," even though Dr. Stringer noted Plaintiff's reports of some pain with SLR testing (see id.). Stated another way, a SLR test is not deemed positive merely because a testee reports pain with testing.17 To be sure, Dr. Fuhrmeister conducted SLR tests on June 20, 2008, and he specifically characterized the test results as "negative," even though Plaintiff reported lower back pain during the testing (tr. 418). Likewise, although Plaintiff reported pain with SLR testing by Dr. Stringer on May 24, 2007, approximately three weeks after her surgery, Dr. Stringer specifically noted that Plaintiff's lower back pain had "no true radicular component" (tr. 347). Plaintiff is correct in noting that Dr. Akerson, her family physician, reported a positive SLR on July 15, 2008 (tr. 501) and, further, that the ALJ did not mention this positive SLR test. However, given the multiple other negative SLR tests, the court finds that the ALJ's failure to mention this one test is—at best—harmless. As noted, Dr. Fuhrmeister found negative SLR tests less than one month before Dr. Akerson's test, and Dr. Berliner also (specifically) reported negative SLR tests when he examined Plaintiff a month after Dr. Akerson's test in August 2008 (tr. 467). Additionally, in January 2009 Dr. Faruqui noted negative SLR tests at 90 degrees, with no back pain. Thus, the undersigned concludes the ALJ did not err in failing to address "numerous" positive SLR tests that allegedly corroborate Plaintiff's complaints of pain, as the record contains no such evidence. To the contrary, the record contains only one notation of a positive SLR test. Therefore, the overall record in this regard may fairly be construed as establishing that Plaintiff's SLR tests did not confirm the presence of radiculopathy or other significant abnormalities. Moreover, there is no reversible error based solely on the ALJ's failure to mention the notation in Dr. Akerson's records. See Dyer v. Barnhart, 395 F.3d 1206 , 1211 (11th Cir. 2005) ("there is no rigid requirement that the ALJ specifically refer to every piece of evidence in his decision," as long as the ALJ's decision "is not a broad rejection which is 'not enough to enable [the district court or this Court] to conclude that [the ALJ] considered her medical condition as a whole.'") (quoting Foote, 67 F.3d at 1561 ).
Finally, Plaintiff contends the ALJ noted a normal NCV study from June 2007 in support of his credibility findings, but failed to note the abnormal EMG study obtained at the same time (doc. 19 at 17). Plaintiff is mistaken. The ALJ specifically stated, "A nerve conduction study of the lower extremities was normal, but an electromyography was abnormal with a finding consistent with [or suspicious for] L5-S1 radiculopathy." (tr. 37). Thus, the ALJ indeed acknowledged the abnormal EMG and considered it, along with other evidence of record, in evaluating Plaintiff's credibility. Further, even though the June 2007 EMG suggested possible [*16] radiculopathy, other evidence obtained after the EMG suggested no radiculopathy, including Dr. Fuhrmeister's negative SLR tests in January 2008 (tr. 418); the March 2008 lumbar MRI, which showed some abnormalities but no evidence of any root effects (tr. 428); Dr. Berliner's negative SLR tests in August 2008 (tr. 467); and Dr. Faruqui's negative SLR tests in January 2009 (tr. 497). Although the December 2010 MRI noted "possible" and "questionable" nerve root compression, this MRI was obtained after the date Plaintiff was last insured for DIB purposes. Thus, during the relevant period, the only objective evidence of possible nerve root involvement is the EMG study from June 2007 and Dr. Akerson's positive SLR test on July 15, 2008 (tr. 501) (which date, incidentally, is the same day Plaintiff asked Dr. Akerson to fill out disability paperwork). On this record, the undersigned concludes that the ALJ's finding—with regard to the lack of objective medical evidence to support Plaintiff's complaints of disabling pain and limitations—is substantially supported by evidence in the record as a whole. As this court is well aware, the findings of the ALJ must be supported by substantial evidence, not unanimous evidence.
In further discounting Plaintiff's complaints, the ALJ noted that Plaintiff's medication was generally effective in controlling her pain (tr. 39). In support the ALJ pointed to evidence in the record, such as treatment notes indicating that Plaintiff's medication prevented her pain from being severe and that her pain improved with rest, medication, and the use of a TENS unit (see, e.g., tr. 39, referencing tr. 444, 495). Plaintiff asserts error as to this finding, arguing that her "medications did not always control her pain" and, essentially, that they controlled her pain only to the extent she refrained from performing basic activities of daily living (doc. 19 at 17). In support, Plaintiff points to instances in the record where she reported that her pain relief was "not good" or that her medications had to be adjusted (doc. 19 at 17). Even if evidence to the contrary of the ALJ's findings exists in the record, as Plaintiff suggests, the ALJ's findings cannot be overturned where "there is substantially supportive evidence" of his findings. Barron v. Sullivan, 924 F.2d 227 , 230 (11th Cir. 1991). And here, there is such supportive evidence. For example, in July 2007 Plaintiff reported very little pain in her back and no radicular leg pain, and she stated she was walking more (tr. 335). Additionally, Dr. Stringer noted that Plaintiff experienced relief of her pain, and her activity level was adequate and could even be increased (tr. 330, 333). He also opined she could perform light duty work (see, e.g., tr. 333). Dr. Fuhrmeister noted in January 2008 that Lyrica was "very effective in helping Plaintiff's leg pain" and that 70% of her back/leg pain was relieved with medication (tr. 414). Dr. Fuhrmeister also noted that Plaintiff's pain improved with sleeping, massage, and heat, and that she performed exercises such as weight lifting four times a week (tr. 415-16). Further, on December 23, 2008, Plaintiff reported that [*17] her medication regimen was working well (tr. 590). In July 2010, Dr. Akerson stated that Plaintiff was stable on Lortab (tr. 571). Also in 2010, Plaintiff advised Dr. Fuhrmeister that she was doing relatively well on her medications (tr. 593). Thus, the ALJ's finding has substantial support in the record, and he did not err in considering this factor—that Plaintiff's medication was generally effective in controlling her pain—in evaluating Plaintiff's credibility, even if evidence in the record arguably supports a contrary finding. Martin v. Sullivan, 894 F.2d 1520 , 1529 (11th Cir. 1990) ("Even if the evidence preponderates against the Commissioner's findings, we must affirm if the decision reached is supported by substantial evidence."); Crawford, 363 F.3d at 1158 (same); Barnes, 932 F.2d at 1358 (same); Walden, 672 F.2d at 838 (the court must abstain "from reweighing the evidence or substituting its own judgment for that of the [Commissioner]") (citations omitted); Barron, 924 F.2d at 230 ("Substantial evidence may even exist contrary to the findings of the ALJ, and we may have taken a different view of it as a factfinder. Yet, if there is substantially supportive evidence, the findings cannot be overturned.").
Continuing, the ALJ noted Plaintiff's relatively benign physical examinations, including those conducted by Dr. Berliner, Dr. Fuhrmeister, and Ms. Towne (tr. 38, 40), as well as Dr. Fuhrmeister's inability to explain Plaintiff's symptoms based on his review of objective medical evidence (tr. 38). These findings are well supported by the record.
Next, the ALJ considered evidence related to Plaintiff's activities of daily living and stated:
Although the claimant has described daily activities which are fairly limited, two factors weigh against considering these allegations to be strong evidence in favor of finding the claimant disabled. First, allegedly limited daily activities cannot be objectively verified with any reasonable degree of certainty. Secondly, even if the claimant's daily activities are truly as limited as alleged, it is difficult to attribute that degree of limitation to the claimant's medical condition, as opposed to other reasons, in view of the relatively weak medical evidence and other factors discussed in this decision. Overall, the claimant's reported limited daily activities are considered to be outweighed by the other factors discussed in this decision.
(tr. 39).

Plaintiff also challenges this finding. She contends that no objective verification of limited daily activities is required and that attributing Plaintiff's limitations to unspecified "other factors" is too vague to enable meaningful review by this court (doc. 19 at 20, citing Wolfe v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec., No. 6:11-CV-1316-ORL-DAB, [2012 BL 203255], 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 112668 , 2012 WL 3264916 , at *6 (M.D. Fla. Aug. 10, 2012)). Even if the Wolfe decision supports Plaintiff's arguments, nearly identical arguments were rejected by the Eleventh Circuit in Anderson v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec., 427 F.App'x 761 , 764 (11th Cir. 2011), albeit in an unpublished decision. In Anderson, the court stated:
The ALJ did not create additional hurdles to the pain standard that required Anderson to objectively prove her limited daily activity; rather, the ALJ merely indicated [*18] that Anderson's testimony about her allegedly limited activities was insufficient to prove that she suffered from disabling pain. The ALJ pointed out that (1) Anderson's statements about limited daily activities were hard to objectively verify, and (2) the limited nature of her activities could have been due to reasons other than pain given the weak medical evidence and other factors indicating that Anderson did not suffer from disabling pain.
Anderson, 427 F. App'x at 764 .

Here, as in Anderson, the ALJ did not require Plaintiff to prove her limited daily activities by some method other than her own testimony. He merely indicated that Plaintiff's statements regarding her limited activities did not compel a finding that she suffered from disabling pain during the relevant period and, similarly, that if her activities were truly as limited as she alleged, they must have been so based on factors other than her pain, in view of the relatively weak medical evidence (and other considerations). Thus, consistent with the findings made in Anderson, the undersigned finds no error here.
In sum, the ALJ applied the correct pain standard and articulated his reasons for finding Plaintiff less than fully credible. Moreover, the reasons he identified are supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole and were otherwise properly considered. Thus, Plaintiff is not entitled to relief on this claim.
B. The Opinions of Dr. Akerson 18 
The ALJ acknowledged the opinions of Dr. Akerson, as contained on the forms he completed in July 2008 (which opinions are detailed, supra, and need not be repeated here (see also tr. 458-63)). The ALJ then assigned little weight to those opinions because Dr. Akerson "relied quite heavily" on Plaintiff's subjective complaints of pain and other symptoms, yet (for the reasons discussed in the preceding section of this Report) Plaintiff was not fully credible (tr. 40). Plaintiff contends the ALJ erred here, noting in part Dr. Akerson's status as a treating physician and arguing that the ALJ impermissibly assigned greater weight to the opinions of non-treating sources over those of Dr. Akerson.
Substantial weight must be given to the opinion, diagnosis and medical evidence of a treating physician unless there is good cause to do otherwise. See Lewis v. Callahan, 125 F.3d 1436 , 1439-1441 (11th Cir. 1997); Edwards v. Sullivan, 937 F.2d 580 , 583 (11th Cir. 1991); Sabo v. Chater, 955 F. Supp. 1456 , 1462 (M.D. Fla. 1996); 20 C.F.R. § 404.1527(d) . "'[G]ood cause' exists when the: (1) treating physician's opinion was not bolstered by the evidence; (2) evidence supported a contrary finding; or (3) treating physician's opinion was conclusory or inconsistent with the doctor's own medical records." Phillips v. Barnhart, 357 F.3d 1232 , 1240-41 (11th Cir. 2004) (citation omitted). The ALJ may discount a treating physician's opinion or report regarding an inability to work if it is unsupported by objective medical evidence or is wholly conclusory. See Edwards, 937 F.2d 580 (finding that the ALJ properly discounted treating physician's report where the physician was unsure of the accuracy of his findings and statements). However, if a treating physician's opinion on the nature and severity of a claimant'[*19] s impairments is well supported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques, and is not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in the record, the ALJ must give it controlling weight. 20 C.F.R. § 404.1527(c)(2) .
When a treating physician's opinion does not warrant controlling weight, the ALJ must nevertheless weigh the medical opinion based on 1) the length of the treatment relationship and the frequency of examination; 2) the nature and extent of the treatment relationship; 3) medical evidence supporting the opinion; 4) consistency with the record as a whole; 5) specialization in the medical issues at issue; and 6) other factors which tend to support or contradict the opinion. Id . Generally, a treating physician's opinion is entitled to more weight than a consulting physician's opinion. See Wilson v. Heckler, 734 F.2d 513 , 518 (11th Cir. 1984).
Here, the ALJ did not err in rejecting the opinions of Dr. Akerson because they were based on Plaintiff's subjective complaints. First, the ALJ's statement is accurate, as the forms completed by Dr. Akerson indicate that he indeed largely based his opinions on Plaintiff's subjective complaints. For example, in explaining his opinions Dr. Akerson stated, "[Plaintiff] has severe pain (subjective) when doing above [postural] activities." (tr. 459). He also stated, "[Plaintiff] drops all items since injury per [Plaintiff]." (tr. 460). And he wrote on the form Plaintiff's report that her "legs go numb after 45 minutes" (see tr. 458).19 Second, the ALJ properly considered this reason in rejecting the opinions. See, e.g., Hartline v. Astrue, 605 F. Supp. 2d 194 , 209 (D.D.C. 2009) ("Because the ALJ found that the opinions of [two treating physicians] were not well-supported by objective findings and/or treatment records and appeared to overly rely on the claimant's subjective complaints he was justified in according them less weight in his analysis.") (internal quotations and alteration omitted).
Additionally, while not stated directly, the ALJ's finding—that Dr. Akerson's opinions are based on Plaintiff's subjective complaints—may reasonably be construed as a finding that Dr. Akerson's opinions are not "well-supported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques," as is required for the opinions to have controlling authority under 20 C.F.R. § 404.1527(c)(2) . Or, similarly, the ALJ's finding is akin to a finding that Dr. Akerson's opinions are not bolstered by credible evidence in the record. Phillips, 357 F.3d at 1240-41 . Thus, the undersigned concludes that the ALJ articulated good cause for rejecting the opinions.
It should also be noted that preprinted forms, such as those completed by Dr. Akerson, do not provide persuasive evidence of the validity of the opinions expressed therein. See, e.g., Hammersley v. Astrue, No. 5:08cv245-Oc-10GRJ, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92697 , 2009 WL 3053707 , at *6 (M.D. Fla. Sept. 18, 2009) ("check-off forms . . . have limited probative value because they are conclusory and provide little narrative or insight into the reasons behind the conclusions") (citing Spencer ex rel. Spencer v. Heckler, 765 F.2d 1090 , 1094 (11th Cir. 1985) (rejecting opinion from a non-examining physician who merely checked boxes on a form without providing any explanation [*20] for his conclusions); Mason v. Shalala, 994 F.2d 1058 , 1065 (3d Cir. 1993) (noting that "[f]orm reports in which a physician's obligation is only to check a box or fill in a blank are weak evidence at best.")).
Thus, having properly discounted the extreme limitations assessed by Dr. Akerson on the check-off forms, the ALJ did not err in relying on other evidence in the record to determine that Plaintiff could perform work at a sedentary level of exertion. The ALJ noted that the RFC for sedentary work is consistent with the opinions of Ms. Towne (who opined that, at a minimum, Plaintiff could perform sedentary work), to which he assigned significant weight (tr. 40). The ALJ also assigned significant weight to the opinions of the non-examining agency physicians ( id.), who—incidentally—both opined that Plaintiff had greater physical capacities than those set forth in the RFC and those assessed by Ms. Towne. Finally, the ALJ evidently considered Plaintiff's performance on multiple physical examinations in support of his overall conclusions (see, e.g., tr. 38, discussing the examinations by Dr. Berliner and Dr. Faruqui).
Although Ms. Towne is not a physician, and Plaintiff claims the ALJ erred in relying on her opinions (doc. 19 at 23-24), any such error does not entitle Plaintiff to relief. Initially, in March 2008, Dr. Fuhrmeister—a treating physician—noted that he concurred with Ms. Towne's opinions and he adopted those opinions (see tr. 435, assessing "[w]ork restrictions as per previous [FCA]"). Moreover, having properly discounted Dr. Akerson's opinions, the ALJ could have relied on the opinions of the non-examining agency physicians, Dr. Krishnamurthy and Dr. Gibson, the only other opinions of record that directly address Plaintiff's RFC (save for Dr. Maddox's opinions, which are discussed in the following section of this Report). And had the ALJ done so, Plaintiff's RFC would have been for light work. Thus, in actuality, the ALJ gave Plaintiff "the benefit of the doubt" by adopting Ms. Towne's opinions, even though Ms. Towne directly stated that Plaintiff self-limited on an inordinately large percentage of the tasks she was asked to perform, and it is evident from Ms. Towne's report that she believed Plaintiff could likely work at a greater exertional level, as did Dr. Krishnamurthy and Dr. Gibson. Therefore, any error in assigning significant weight to Ms. Towne's opinions is harmless.
Finally, to the extent Plaintiff contends that in determining her RFC the ALJ was required to choose the opinion of a particular physician, such as Dr. Akerson (see doc. 19 at 21-22), the contention is unavailing. See, e.g., Schmidt v. Astrue, 496 F.3d 833 , 845 (7th Cir. 2007) (holding that in determining a claimant's RFC, "the ALJ is not required to rely entirely on a particular physician's opinion or choose between the opinions of the claimant's physicians"). Similarly, as the Tenth Circuit recently noted:
[T]here is no requirement in the regulations for a direct correspondence between an RFC finding and a specific medical opinion on the functional capacity in question. "[T]he ALJ, not a physician, is charged with determining a claimant's RFC from the [*21] medical record." Howard v. Barnhart, 379 F.3d 945 , 949 (10th Cir. 2004) (following 20 C.F.R. § 416.927(e)(2) and SSR 96-5p, 1996 SSR LEXIS 2 , *14, 1996 WL 374183 , at *5); see also 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1546(c) and 416.946(c) . We have thus "rejected [the] argument that there must be specific, affirmative, medical evidence on the record as to each requirement of an exertional work level before an ALJ can determine RFC within that category." Howard, 379 F.3d at 949 ; see, e.g., Wall [v. Astrue], 561 F.3d [1048 ,] 1068-69 [(10th Cir. 2009)] (upholding ALJ's findings on mental impairment where record did not contain any treating or examining medical opinions as to allegedly disabling pain disorder); Bernal v. Bowen, 851 F.2d 297 , 302-03 (10th Cir. 1988) (holding ALJ properly made mental RFC findings without expert medical assistance).
Chapo v. Astrue, 682 F.3d 1285 , 1288-89 (10th Cir. 2012) (footnote omitted). See also Nation v. Barnhart, 153 F. App'x 597 (11th Cir. 2005) (unpublished) ("The ALJ is not required to seek additional independent expert medical testimony before making a disability determination if the record is sufficient and additional expert testimony is not necessary for an informed decision."); Poke v. Astrue, No. 1:10CV768-CSC, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7676 , 2012 WL 174472 , at *4 & n.10 (M.D. Ala. Jan. 23, 2012) ("[T]he court disagrees to the extent that these cases [from other district courts] suggest that the fourth-step [RFC] determination must be based on a medical source evaluation. . . . Nation does not stand for the proposition that an ALJ must always secure an [sic] residual functional capacity evaluation [or assessment] from a medical source."). As can be seen then, an ALJ must develop the RFC based on the entire record, not the opinion of one physician. Here, the ALJ did as he was required to do.

C. Evidence Submitted to the Appeals Council
As previously noted, Plaintiff requested review by the Appeals Council ("AC") of the ALJ's unfavorable decision, and she submitted additional evidence to the AC in support of her request (that is, Dr. Maddox's letter dated February 28, 2011) (see tr. 5-6, 284-85). The AC denied review after determining, in relevant part, that Dr. Maddox's "narrative opinion" had no "material bearing on the [ALJ's] decision and would not change the [ALJ's] findings" (tr. 6). Plaintiff claims the AC erred in so concluding (see doc. 19 at 24-25).
A social security claimant generally is permitted to present new evidence at each stage of the administrative process. See 20 C.F.R. § 404.900(b) ; see also Ingram, 496 F.3d at 1261 . The AC has the discretion not to review the ALJ's denial of benefits. 20 C.F.R. § 404.967 . But the AC must consider "new and material evidence" that "relates to the period on or before the date of [the ALJ] hearing decision" and must review the case if the ALJ's "action, findings, or conclusion is contrary to the weight of the evidence currently of record." 20 C.F.R. § 404.970(b) .
Additionally, there are two methods by which a reviewing court may remand a cause under 42 U.S.C. § 405(g) —" sentence four remands" and "sentence six remands." Ingram, 496 F.3d at 1261 . A sentence four remand is appropriate when the claimant submitted new evidence to the AC, which the AC did not adequately consider in denying the claimant's request for review.20  Id. at 1268 . To obtain a sentence four remand, the claimant must show that, in light of the new evidence submitted to the AC, the ALJ's decision to deny benefits is not supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole [*22] or, similarly, that the new evidence renders the denial of benefits erroneous.21  Id. at 1262 , 1266-67 ; see also 20 C.F.R. § 404.970(b) .
Here, Plaintiff has not made, and cannot make, the requisite showing to warrant a sentence four remand based on the new evidence she presented to the AC. Initially, Dr. Maddox's letter is dated February 28, 2011, and in it she offers retrospective opinions as to Plaintiff's capacities (e.g., Dr. Maddox states that she reviewed records from the Brain and Spine Center/Dr. Springer and "more recent [but unidentified] notes" and then opines that Plaintiff is limited to functioning in a work setting at no more than the sedentary level and that Plaintiff's restrictions "would have been in place at least back to 10/2/2007 [the date of Ms. Towne's FCA]" (tr. 285)). Dr. Maddox, however, did not begin treating Plaintiff until late December 2010, which was after Plaintiff's date last insured for DIB purposes. See Carroll v. Soc. Sec. Admin., Com'r, 453 F. App'x 889 , 893 (11th Cir. 2011) (unpublished) (finding that, in discounting treating physician's opinion, ALJ did not err in considering that the physician did not treat the claimant until after her date last insured or conclude she was disabled during the eligibility period at issue; also noting that the treating physician's records "do not reflect that he conducted any psychological tests during his treatment of Carroll, much less any that could retrospectively establish her disability."). Moreover, as noted supra, in support of her opinions Dr. Maddox specifically referenced MRI results that "confirm impingement of the L5 vertebral body" (tr. 285). This MRI, however, was obtained on December 14, 2010, after the relevant period. " Evidence is irrelevant and immaterial when it relates to a time period after the eligibility determination at issue."  Id. at 892 (citing Wilson v. Apfel, 179 F.3d 1276 , 1278-79 (11th Cir. 1999) (per curiam) (explaining that a medical opinion given one year after the denial of benefits "may be relevant to whether a deterioration in [the claimant's] condition subsequently entitled her to benefits" but is not probative to the issue of eligibility during the time period for which benefits were denied)). Further, Dr. Maddox's opinions contradict those of Dr. Stringer, a neurologist who treated Plaintiff during the relevant period and released her to light duty work, as well as the opinions of Dr. Fuhrmeister, another treating physician, who found Plaintiff capable of performing sedentary work during the relevant period. Finally, it is worth noting that Dr. Maddox's opinions are not substantially inconsistent with the ALJ's RFC determination. As previously discussed, Dr. Maddox found Plaintiff capable of performing work at a sedentary level, with lifting no more than ten pounds and walking or standing no more than two hours in an eight-hour workday. Cf. 20 C.F.R. § 404.1567(a) ("Sedentary work involves lifting no more than 10 pounds at a time and occasionally lifting or carrying articles like docket files, ledgers, and small tools. Although a sedentary job is defined as one which involves sitting, a certain amount of walking and standing is often necessary in carrying out [*23] job duties. Jobs are sedentary if walking and standing are required occasionally and other sedentary criteria are met."). Although Dr. Maddox additionally opined that Plaintiff might experience pain with long bouts of sitting, might be unable to complete eight-hour workdays all the time, and might be unable to work more than six hours a day, she nevertheless found Plaintiff capable of working. Importantly, she rendered these opinions after reviewing the December 2010 MRI, which arguably demonstrates a worsening of Plaintiff's condition (after her date last insured), but she nevertheless concluded that Plaintiff could work—and—could work with restrictions that are quite similar to those set forth in the RFC.
In sum, the information contained in Dr. Maddox's letter dated February 28, 2011, does not render the ALJ's actions, findings, or conclusions contrary to the weight of the evidence of record, and does not render the denial of benefits erroneous. 20 C.F.R. § 404.970(b) . Thus, a remand pursuant to sentence four of § 405(g) is not warranted.
VI. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Commissioner's decision is supported by substantial evidence and should not be disturbed. 42 U.S.C. § 405(g) ; Lewis, 125 F. 3d at 1439 ; Foote, 67 F.3d at 1560 . Furthermore, Plaintiff has failed to show that the ALJ or the AC applied improper legal standards, erred in making their findings, or that any other ground for reversal exists.
Accordingly, it is ORDERED that:
Carolyn W. Colvin is substituted for Michael J. Astrue as Defendant in this action. And it is respectfully RECOMMENDED that:
The decision of the Commissioner be AFFIRMED, this action be DISMISSED, and the clerk be directed to close the file.
At Pensacola, Florida this 3rd day of January 2014.

All references to "tr." refer to the transcript of Social Security Administration record filed on February 28, 2013 (docs. 10, 11, 12). Moreover, the page numbers refer to those found on the lower right-hand corner of each page of the transcript, as opposed to those assigned by the court's electronic docketing system or any other numbers that may appear.

fn

Thus, the time frame relevant to this appeal is December 4, 2006 (alleged onset) through September 30, 2010 (date last insured), which time frame will hereafter be referred to as the "relevant period."

fn 
4
Neurologists Douglas Stringer and Merle Stringer—who work in the same facility (the Brain and Spine Center, L.L.C. (see, e.g., tr. 395))—each treated Plaintiff during the relevant period. For the sake of simplicity, the court will hereafter refer to these physicians as one individual, "Dr. Stringer."

fn 
5
A treatment record dated January 15, 2007, reflects that Plaintiff had completed PT (tr. 384). Thus, although there are no PT records in the file, it appears that Plaintiff underwent a short course of PT between (approximately) December 12, 2006, and January 15, 2007. She reported, however, that the PT resulted in only "minimal improvement in her symptomatology" ( id).

fn 
6
Previously, on May 8, 2007, Plaintiff called Dr. Stringer and stated she was experiencing leg cramps despite taking Zanaflex, and had back and hip discomfort when sitting (tr. 352). Dr. Stringer called the pharmacy and switched Plaintiff from Zanaflex to Flexeril ( id.).

fn 
7
Thus, although Dr. Stringer had previously assessed lumbar disc disease "with some evidence suggestive of nerve root irritation and/or compression" (tr. 342, 345), after reviewing the MRI that revealed no evidence of nerve root impingement or compression (tr. 337, 340), his diagnosis changed to "lumbar disc disease ... [with] no evidence of lumbar nerve root compression" (see, e.g., tr. 336).

fn 
8
The FCA was conducted on October 2, 2007 (tr. 311-15), and the results of this FCA are included, infra, in section IV.D. of this Report.

fn 
9
The form offered two options regarding the duration Plaintiff can sit; one indicates "[l]ess than about 6 hours in an 8-hour workday," and the other indicates "about 8 hours in an 8-hour workday" (tr. 459). Dr. Askerson selected the former option but wrote next to it, "Less than 5 minutes." (tr. 459).

fn 
10
Plaintiff also saw Dr. Akerson in 2009 for a variety of issues, including problems with urination, a sinus infection, a cyst, abdominal pain, and ringing in her ears (tr. 540, 533, 536, 541, 547, respectively).

fn 
11
Plaintiff's musculoskeletal system was described as "normal" in one record, as were her "gait and station" (see tr. 559, 560), and in another record the only musculoskeletal abnormality noted was "myalgias" (tr. 562).

fn 
12
Dr. Akerson attended to Plaintiff in the hospital, and he noted that Plaintiff had DDD but was "[s]table on Lortab," and he directed staff to continue administering the Lortab (tr. 571).

fn 
13
Dr. Maddox referenced a previous examination of Plaintiff and stated that Plaintiff's condition was "essentially unchanged from my previous evaluation" (tr. 618), but there is no evidence of a prior examination by Dr. Maddox in the record. Dr. Maddox is in practice with Dr. Elzawahry, but he conducted NCV/EMG studies of Plaintiff in June 2007, not a physical examination (see tr. 306-09). Dr. Maddox's reference to a prior examination thus appears to have been made in error.

fn 
14
Dr. Maddox did not identify the date the date of the MRI she reviewed, but it must have been the MRI obtained in December 2010 because Plaintiff presented to Dr. Maddox two weeks after that MRI and did so specifically for follow up as to that MRI (as well as the MRA). Moreover, the December 2010 MRI is the only lumbar MRI of record that indicates nerve root compression.

fn 
15
In one section of his opinion, in an obvious scrivener's error, the ALJ stated that Plaintiff's RFC was for light work (tr. 40). The parties do not dispute—and it is clear to the undersigned—that the ALJ found that Plaintiff had the RFC to perform the full range of sedentary work and, as such, could return to her past relevant work as a customer service representative, which work she performed at a sedentary level of exertion (see, e.g., tr. 37, 41, 50).

fn 
16
The record shows that other diagnostic tests were also negative, such as the Babinski's test (see, e.g., tr. 365, 467), Hoffmann's test (tr. 467), and deep tendon reflex tests (tr. 365, 393, 497), not to mention the numerous physical examinations that were largely unremarkable (with the exception of tenderness to palpation, some limits in lumbar range of motion, and at times a mildly antalgic gait).

fn 
17
See, e.g., http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1495170/ (last visited Dec. 21, 2013) ("A positive response [to SLR testing] reproduces radiating leg pain when the limb is raised to less than 60 °."); http://www.sh.lsuhsc.edu/fammed/outpatientmanual/lowbackpain.htm (last visited Dec. 21, 2013) ("A positive SLR is present when the patient experiences both back pain and pain into the posterior thigh at 60 degrees or less.")

fn 
18
Plaintiff refers to the opinions of "Dr. Ackerman" (see doc. 19 at 21-22), but there are no records from a Dr. Ackerman in the file, and the records Plaintiff references in support of this claim are those of Dr. Akerson (see, e.g., id., citing tr. 459-60). It is thus evident that this claim relates to Dr. Akerson, Plaintiff's primary care physician.

fn 
19
As Plaintiff points out, Dr. Akerson did indicate that Plaintiff's lifting, carrying, standing, and sitting limitations were assessed in light of Plaintiff's compression fracture at L5 (doc. 19 at 21, citing tr. 459). However, as previously noted, the ALJ's findings need not be based on a unanimous record, only substantial evidence. It is clear from a review of the forms completed by Dr. Akerson that his opinions were largely—nearly exclusively—based on Plaintiff's subjective complaints (see tr. 458-61).

fn 
20
In contrast, a sentence six remand is appropriate only when the claimant submits evidence for the first time to the district court that might have changed the outcome of the administrative proceeding. Ingram, 496 F.3d at 1267-68 . As Plaintiff submitted no new evidence to this court, a remand under sentence six would be inappropriate.

fn 
21
The fourth sentence of § 405(g) , which is applicable here, provides the federal court with the "power to enter, upon the pleadings and transcript of the record, a judgment affirming, modifying, or reversing the decision of the Commissioner of Social Security, with or without remanding the cause for a rehearing." 42 U.S.C. § 405(g) .

K. MICHAEL MOORE 
[*679] ORDER GRANTING IN PART PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO STRIKE OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR A MORE DEFINITIVE STATEMENT
This cause is before the Court on Plaintiff's Motion to Strike Defendant Breckenridge Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s Affirmative Defenses or, in the Alternative, Plaintiff's Motion for a More Definitive Statement (the "Motion" or "Motion to Strike") (ECF No. 50). The matter has been fully briefed and is ripe for review. For the reasons that follow, the Motion to Strike is granted in part and denied in part.
I. BACKGROUND 
This is an action by Plaintiff Maggie Tsavaris against several pharmaceutical companies, including Defendant Breckenridge Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Breckenridge"), arising out of personal injuries she allegedly sustained after consuming the defendants' medications. The eight-count Amended Complaint (ECF No. 30) asserts claims for negligence, negligent misrepresentation, and strict products liability based on the defendants' design, manufacture, and distribution of Prempro and Activella, hormone replacement therapy drugs Tsavaris alleges caused her breast cancer. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 1-229. As relief, Tsavaris seeks compensatory and punitive damages, attorney's fees and costs, and a recall of Prempro and Activella. Am. Compl. at 72.
In response, Breckenridge asserts twenty-nine "defenses and affirmative defenses."1 See Breckenridge's Answer to Am. Compl. ("Answer") at 29-34 (ECF No. 42). They challenge the Amended Complaint on various grounds, including a failure to state a claim for relief, federal preemption, [**2] statute of limitations, [*680] and comparative negligence. See Answer at 31-34.
Tsavaris, in turn, moves to strike Breckenridge's defenses as legally insufficient. See Pl.'s Mot. to Strike at 2 (ECF No. 50). She argues that the twenty-nine defenses are mere conclusions of law unsupported by any facts. Id. Breckenridge, on the other hand, argues that the Court should deny the Motion because the defenses (1) comply with the applicable pleading standard, (2) do not prejudice Tsavaris, and (3) raise legitimate issues of fact and law related to Tsavaris's claims. See Breckenridge's Mem. of Law in Opp'n to Pl.'s Mot. to Strike at 1.
II. DISCUSSION 
The issue presented is whether Breckenridge's "defenses and affirmative defenses" survive Tsavaris's Motion to Strike. Before answering that question, however, this Court must first determine the appropriate pleading standard for affirmative defenses. As discussed more fully below, district courts around the country, including in this circuit, disagree over the applicable standard, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has yet to resolve this split.
A. Legal Standard 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(f) authorizes a district court to "strike from a pleading an insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter." Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f) . Although a court has broad discretion when considering a motion to strike, see Morrison v. Exec. Aircraft Refinishing Co., 434 F. Supp. 2d 1314 , 1317-18 (S.D. Fla. 2005), striking a defense from a pleading is a drastic remedy generally disfavored by courts. Pujals ex rel. El Rey De Los Habanos, Inc. v. Garcia, 777 F. Supp. 2d 1322 , 1327 (S.D. Fla. 2011). For that reason, a motion to strike an affirmative defense is typically denied unless the defense (1) has no possible relation to the controversy, (2) may cause prejudice to one of the parties, or (3) fails to satisfy the general pleading requirements of Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure . Nobles v. Convergent Healthcare Recoveries, Inc., No. 8:15-CV-1745-T-30MAP, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 115448 , [2015 BL 281614], 2015 WL 5098877 , at *1 (M.D. Fla. Aug. 31, 2015). Tsavaris moves to strike based on the third ground.
But district courts disagree over the standard required for pleading affirmative defenses. Some courts have held that affirmative defenses are subject to the heightened pleading standard of Rule 8(a) set forth in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 , 127 S. Ct. 1955 , 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007), and Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 , 129 S. Ct. 1937 , 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). See, e.g., In re Checking Account Overdraft Litig., No. 1:09-MD-02036-JLK, 307 F.R.D. 656 , 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74667 , [2015 BL 179984], 2015 WL 3551527 , at *19 (S.D. Fla. June 8, 2015); Grovenor House, L.L.C. v. E.I. Du Pont De Nemours And Co., No. 09-21698-CIV, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 91905 , [2010 BL 186646], 2010 WL 3212066 , at *1 (S.D. Fla. Aug. 12, 2010); Castillo v. Roche Labs. Inc., No. 10-20876-CIV, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87681 , [2010 BL 400180], 2010 WL 3027726 , at *2 (S.D. Fla. Aug. 2, 2010). Under this standard, an affirmative defense that "merely offer[s] labels and conclusions or a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do." Adams v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., No. 3:11-CV-337-J-37MCR, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 79366 , [2011 BL 190520], 2011 WL 2938467 , at *2 (M.D. Fla. July 21, 2011) (citation omitted). Instead, a defense would have to contain enough factual matter to "raise a right to relief above the speculative level." Id. (citation omitted).
Courts adopting this position advance two main arguments in support. The first is based on considerations of fairness. It is unfair, these courts reason, "to require a plaintiff to provide [the] defendant with enough notice that [**3] there is a plausible, factual basis for . . . [the plaintiff's] claim under one pleading standard and then permit the defendant under another pleading standard simply to suggest that some defense may possibly apply in the case." E.g., Castillo, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87681 , [2010 BL 400180], 2010 WL 3027726 , at *2 (citation omitted). The second argument is based on considerations of policy. Courts embracing a higher pleading standard maintain that boilerplate defenses clutter the docket, create unnecessary work, and delay discovery. E.g., id. (citing Palmer v. Oakland Farms, Inc., No. 5:10CV00029, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63265 , [2010 BL 142147], 2010 WL 2605179 , at *1 (W.D. Va. June 24, 2010).
Other courts, however, have held that the heightened pleading standard of Twombly [*681] and Iqbal does not apply to affirmative defenses. See, e.g., Tarasewicz v. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., No. 14-CIV-60885, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45923 , [2015 BL 100090], 2015 WL 1566398 , at *2 (S.D. Fla. Apr. 8, 2015); Sparta Ins. Co. v. Colareta, No. 13-60579-CIV, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 146700 , [2013 BL 398794], 2013 WL 5588140 , at *1 (S.D. Fla. Oct. 10, 2013); Gonzalez v. Midland Credit Mgmt., Inc., No. 6:13-CV-1576-ORL-37, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 160093 , [2013 BL 311555], 2013 WL 5970721 , at *3 (M.D. Fla. Nov. 8, 2013); Ramnarine v. CP RE Holdco 2009-1, LLC, No. 12-61716-CIV, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60009 , [2013 BL 112258], 2013 WL 1788503 , at *1 (S.D. Fla. Apr. 26, 2013); Adams v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., No. 3:11-cv-337-J-37MCR, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 79366 , [2011 BL 190520], 2011 WL 2938467 , at *2-3 (M.D. Fla. July 21, 2011); Floyd v. SunTrust Banks, Inc., No. 1:10-CV-2620-RWS, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 65190 , [2011 BL 422441], 2011 WL 2441744 (N.D. Ga. June 13, 2011); Jackson v. City of Centreville, 269 F.R.D. 661 (N.D. Ala. 2010); Blanc v. Safetouch, Inc., No. 3:07-cv-1200-J-25TEM, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68158 , [2008 BL 193592], 2008 WL 4059786 , at *1 (M.D. Fla. Aug. 27, 2008). In support, these courts point to the differences between Rule 8(a), which governs the pleading of claims, and Rules 8(b) and (c), which apply to affirmative defenses. Sparta, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 146700 , [2013 BL 398794], 2013 WL 5588140 , at *2. Rule 8(a)(2) requires that a claim for relief contain "a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief," while Rule 8(b)(1)(A) provides only that, when responding to a pleading, a party must "state in short and plain terms its defenses to each claim asserted against it." Id .; see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2) , (b)(1)(A). Similarly, Rule 8(c) requires a party to "affirmatively state any avoidance or affirmative defense." Sparta, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 146700 , [2013 BL 398794], 2013 WL 5588140 , at *2; see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c) .
Courts offer at least three justifications for applying a less stringent standard to affirmative defenses. First, these courts maintain that the Twombly standard is rooted in Rule 8(a) 's "showing" requirement. See, e.g., E.E.O.C. v. Joe Ryan Enterprises, Inc., 281 F.R.D. 660 , 662 (M.D. Ala. 2012) (citing cases). As proof, they cite various parts of the Twombly opinion, including one particularly telling passage where the United States Supreme Court explains that "Rule 8(a)(2) still requires a 'showing,' rather than a blanket assertion, of entitlement to relief." Sparta, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 146700 , [2013 BL 398794], 2013 WL 5588140 , at *3 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 n.3). Juxtaposing the "showing" language in Rule 8(a) with the "stating" language in Rules 8(b) and (c) , these same courts then point out the difference between requiring the statement of something and requiring the showing of something:
"To state" means "[t]o set forth in words; declare," while "to show" refers to the practice of "demonstrat[ing] by reasoning or procedure" or "demonstrat[ing] to by reasoning or procedure; inform[ing] or prov[ing] to: showed him how to fix the camera; showed her that it could really happen." Thus, showing requires significantly more than stating alone.
Id . (internal citations omitted).

Second, relying on well-settled principles of statutory construction, courts applying a lower pleading [**4] standard to affirmative defenses maintain that,
if the drafters of Rule 8 had intended for the "showing" requirement to apply to the pleading of defenses, they knew how to say it, as demonstrated by Rule 8(a) , and would have written that requirement into Rules 8(b) and (c) . The drafters of Rules 8(b) and (c) having not done so, these courts reason, the judiciary is not free to engraft the "showing" requirement onto these rules itself. Thus, these courts conclude, where, as with Rule 8 , the language of the provision being construed is clear, the analysis ends with the language, and the court may not take into account policy considerations.
Id . (internal citations omitted).

Lastly, and at least for courts in this circuit, a lower pleading standard is consistent with binding case law. While the Eleventh Circuit has addressed affirmative defenses, it has not extended the pleading requirements of Rule 8(a) beyond claims. Rather, the appeals court has stressed that notice is the main purpose of Rule 8(c) . See Hassan v. U.S. Postal Serv., 842 F.2d 260 , 263 (11th Cir.1988) ("The purpose of Rule 8(c) is simply to guarantee that the opposing party has notice of any additional issue that may be raised at trial so that he or she is prepared to properly litigate it."). In fact, in Hassan, the Eleventh Circuit allowed the defendant [*682] to raise an affirmative defense it did not even plead because the plaintiff had notice. Id .; see also Hewitt v. Mobile Research Tech., Inc., 285 F. App'x 694 , 696 (11th Cir. 2008) ("When a plaintiff has notice that an affirmative defense will be raised at trial, the failure of defendant to plead the affirmative defense does not prejudice the plaintiff, and it is not error for the district court to hear evidence on the issue.").
Based on these rationales, this Court joins the growing number of courts in this circuit and others in finding that a lower pleading standard applies to affirmative defenses. Such an approach is faithful both to the letter and the spirit of Rules 8(b) and (c) , as revealed through the plain language of Rule 8 and Eleventh Circuit precedent.
B. Breckenridge's Defenses 
Having established the pleading standard applicable to affirmative defenses, the next issue the Court must decide is whether Breckenridge's "defenses and affirmative defenses" are well-pleaded under that standard.
1. Defenses Nos. 5, 7, 8, 13, 14, 16, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 
The Court finds that affirmative defenses nos. 5, 7, 8, 13-14, 16, and 20-24 do not satisfy even the lower pleading standard articulated above. Although Rule 8 does not obligate a defendant to set forth detailed factual allegations, a defendant must give the plaintiff "fair notice" of the nature of a defense and the grounds on which it rests. Adams v. Jumpstart Wireless Corp., 294 F.R.D. 668 , 671 (S.D. Fla. 2013); see also Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 . "A court must not tolerate shotgun pleading of affirmative defenses, and should strike vague and ambiguous defenses which do not respond to any particular count, allegation or legal basis of a complaint." Morrison v. Exec. Aircraft Refinishing, Inc., 434 F. Supp. 2d 1314 , 1318 (S.D. Fla. 2005) (internal citations omitted). Here, affirmative defenses nos. 5, 7, 8, 11, 13-17, and 20-24 are bare-bone conclusions of law without [**5] any supporting facts, failing to give Tsavaris "fair notice" of the defenses Breckenridge intends to raise and develop in this case. Therefore, they are stricken with leave to replead.
2. Defenses Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 17, 18, 19, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 
The Court, however, finds that defenses nos. 1-4, 6, 9, 10-12, 15, 17-19, and 25-29 are not affirmative defenses, but rather denials, contrary to Tsavaris's characterization. "An affirmative defense is established only when a defendant admits the essential facts of a complaint and sets up other facts in justification or avoidance." Royal Caribbean Cruises, Ltd. v. Jackson, 921 F. Supp. 2d 1366 , 1372 (S.D. Fla. 2013). For that reason, a defense that simply points out a defect or lack of evidence in a plaintiff's case is not an affirmative defense. See In re Rawson Food Service, Inc., 846 F.2d 1343 , 1349 (11th Cir. 1988). When a defendant mislabels a specific denial as a defense, the proper remedy is to treat the claim as a denial, not to strike it. FDIC v. Bristol Home Mortgage Lending, LLC, No. 08-81536-CIV, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74683 , [2009 BL 368369], 2009 WL 2488302 at *3 (S.D. Fla. Aug. 13, 2009). Here, defenses nos. 1-4, 6, 9, 10-12, 15, 18-19, and 25-29 do not attempt to avoid liability while admitting to the essential facts of the Amended Complaint. Instead, they attack the Amended Complaint, either by denying the allegations outright or identifying a defect or lack of evidence in Tsavaris's case. Because the proper remedy is to construe these defenses as denials, Tsavaris's request to strike them is denied.
III. CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, it is hereby ordered and adjudged that Tsavaris's Motion to Strike (ECF No. 50) is granted in part and denied in part as follows:
1. The Motion to Strike is granted with leave to replead as to affirmative defenses nos. 5, 7, 8, 13, 14, 16, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24; and
2. The Motion to Strike is denied as to defenses nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 17, 18, 19, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29.

Breckenridge has until October 9, 2015, to replead the stricken defenses.
Done and ordered in Chambers at Miami, Florida, this 25th day of September, 2015.

CECILIA M. ALTONAGA, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE.

CECILIA M. ALTONAGA 
ORDER
Defendant, the Coca-Cola Company ("Defendant" or "Coca-Cola") filed a Motion to Transfer Venue Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) ("Motion") [ECF No. 34] on March 17, 2016. Plaintiff, Rothschild Connected Devices Innovations, LLC ("Plaintiff" or "RCDI") filed its Opposition to Defendant's Motion to Transfer Venue to Atlanta ("Response") [ECF No. 42] on April 8, 2016. The Court need not wait for a reply to resolve the matter. The Court has carefully considered the parties' written submissions, including exhibits attached to their papers; the record; and applicable law. For the reasons explained below, the Motion is granted.
I. BACKGROUND 
Plaintiff is a limited liability company incorporated in Texas with a single member, Leigh M. Rothschild ("Rothschild"), who resides in Miami, Florida. (See Complaint [ECF No. 1] ¶ 1). Defendant is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Atlanta, Georgia. (See id. ¶ 2). Rothschild is an inventor and owns the two patents at issue in this case, which describe customized beverage mixing capability via a user interface. (See id. ¶¶ 7-8). Plaintiff argues Defendant's "Freestyle" personalized beverage dispenser infringes on these patents. (See id. ¶¶ 15-48). Defendant argues it created the Freestyle dispenser in Atlanta on its own, between 2004 and 2009, and has not infringed Plaintiff's patents. (See Mot. 2-3; see generally Answer . . . [ECF No. 12]).
Defendant requests transfer of the case to the Northern District of Georgia, which encompasses Atlanta, arguing both RCDI and this case have only limited connections to Florida, whereas the witnesses; evidence; and alleged infringement are almost exclusively in and/or concerning Atlanta. (See Mot. 2-4). Plaintiff argues this case has strong connections to Florida (see Resp. 3, 5-6), but rests its opposition mostly on the purported untimeliness of the Motion (see  id. 6-7), and the argument its choice to litigate in its home forum "weighs heavily, deferentially and conclusively in favor of RCDI, who resides in Florida" ( id. 2).
II. LEGAL STANDARD 
Federal law provides "[f]or the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought." 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) (alteration added). The purpose of section 1404(a) is to "avoid unnecessary inconvenience to the litigants, witnesses, and the public, and to conserve time, energy, and money." Cellularvision Tech. & Telecomms., L.P. v. Alltel Corp., 508 F. Supp. 2d 1186 , 1189 (S.D. Fla. 2007) (citation omitted). [*2] Courts have broad discretion "to adjudicate motions for transfer according to an 'individualized, case-by-case consideration of convenience and fairness.'" Stewart Org., Inc. v. Ricoh Corp., 487 U.S. 22 , 29 , 108 S. Ct. 2239 , 101 L. Ed. 2d 22 (1988) (quoting Van Dusen v. Barrack, 376 U.S. 612 , 622 , 84 S. Ct. 805 , 11 L. Ed. 2d 945 (1964)); accord Meterlogic, Inc. v. Copier Solutions, Inc., 185 F. Supp. 2d 1292 , 1299 (S.D. Fla. 2002).
Once a court finds an action could have been brought in the transferee forum, the court "must weigh various factors . . . to determine if a transfer . . . is justified." Windmere Corp. v. Remington Prods., Inc., 617 F. Supp. 8 , 10 (S.D. Fla. 1985) (alterations added; citation omitted). Courts should consider at least the following private and public interest factors to determine whether transfer is appropriate:
(1) the convenience of the witnesses; (2) the location of relevant documents and the relative ease of access to sources of proof; (3) the convenience of the parties; (4) the locus of operative facts; (5) the availability of process to compel the attendance of unwilling witnesses; (6) the relative means of the parties; (7) a forum's familiarity with the governing law; (8) the weight accorded a plaintiff's choice of forum; and (9) trial efficiency and the interests of justice, based on the totality of the circumstances.
Manuel v. Convergys Corp., 430 F.3d 1132 , 1135 n.1 (11th Cir. 2005) (citation omitted); see also Meterlogic, 185 F. Supp. 2d at 1300 .

It is the movant's burden to establish transfer is warranted. See Cent. Money Mortg. Co. [IMC], Inc. v. Holman, 122 F. Supp. 2d 1345 , 1346 (M.D. Fla. 2000). This burden is high: a plaintiff's choice of forum "should not be disturbed unless it is clearly outweighed by other considerations." Robinson v. Giarmarco & Bill, P.C., 74 F.3d 253 , 260 (11th Cir. 1996) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); accord Mason v. Smithkline Beecham Clinical Labs., 146 F. Supp. 2d 1355 , 1359 (S.D. Fla. 2001) ("Transfer can only be granted where the balance of convenience of the parties strongly favors the defendant." (emphasis in original; citations omitted)). However, "where the operative facts underlying the cause of action did not occur within the forum chosen by the Plaintiff, the choice of forum is entitled to less consideration." Windmere Corp., 617 F. Supp. at 10 (citations omitted).
III. ANALYSIS 
A. Timeliness 
Plaintiff argues the Motion is untimely because it was not brought with "reasonable promptness." (Resp. 6 (citing In re Wyeth, 406 F. App'x 475 , 477 (Fed Cir. 2010))). In Wyeth, the court denied transfer of a case that had gone on for 17 months prior to the motion to transfer, finding the transfer would waste judicial resources already expended. See 406 F. App'x at 476-77 . Here, Defendant sought transfer four and a half months after the filing of the Complaint — roughly a quarter as long as in Wyeth — and soon after the parties reached an impasse in mediation. (See [ECF No. 31]). Additionally, as discussed below, the Court does not find transfer would waste judicial resources, as few resources have been expended to date and virtually no duplication of effort will be required. Thus, the Court disagrees with Plaintiff's assertion "the facts of this case lead[] to the ineluctable conclusion that Coca-Cola's motion to transfer was not timely filed" (Resp. 6 (alteration added; emphasis in original)), and considers the Motion on the merits.
B. The Section 1404(a) Analysis 
1. This Action Might Have Been Brought [*3] in the Northern District of Georgia 
An action might have been brought in a transferee district if that district has subject matter jurisdiction over the action, venue is proper, and the parties are amenable to service of process in the transferee forum. See Meterlogic, 185 F. Supp. 2d at 1299 . Defendant argues this action could have been brought in the Northern District of Georgia because Coca-Cola's principal place of business is in Atlanta, Georgia. (See Mot. 5-6). Plaintiff does not explicitly address this point, and therefore effectively concedes it. This preliminary inquiry being satisfied, the Court turns to an examination of the remaining factors.
2. The Private Interest Factors Weigh in Favor of Transfer 
The next consideration is whether transfer would be for the convenience of the parties and witnesses and in the interest of justice. "Private [interest] factors . . . include the relative ease of access to sources of proof, access to unwilling and willing witnesses, ability to compel testimony, the possibility of view of [the] premises, and the enforceability of a judgment." Wilson v. Island Seas Invs., Ltd., 590 F.3d 1264 , 1270 (11th Cir. 2009) (alterations added) (citing Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert, 330 U.S. 501 , 508 , 67 S. Ct. 839 , 91 L. Ed. 1055 (1947); Liquidation Comm'n of Banco Intercontinental, S.A. v. Renta, 530 F.3d 1339 , 1356 (11th Cir. 2008)). "These factors are not exhaustive, and the district court should be flexible in applying them." Wilson, 590 F.3d at 1270 (citing King v. Cessna Aircraft Co., 562 F.3d 1374 , 1381-82 (11th Cir. 2009)).
a. Weight Accorded Plaintiff's Choice of Forum 
In balancing the factors, the Court must account for the "strong presumption against disturbing . . . [a plaintiff's] initial forum choice." La Seguridad v. Transytur Line, 707 F.2d 1304 , 1307 (11th Cir. 1983) (quoting Pain v. United Tech. Corp., 637 F.2d 775 , 784-85 , 205 U.S. App. D.C. 229 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (alterations added)). Yet courts accord plaintiffs less deference "when the operative facts underlying the action occurred outside the district chosen by the plaintiff." Moghaddam v. Dunkin Donuts, Inc., No. 02-60045-CIV, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14952 , 2002 WL 1940724 , at *3 (S.D. Fla. Aug. 13, 2002) (citation omitted). A plaintiff's choice also deserves less weight when the plaintiff resides outside the forum. See Soler v. Indymac Mortg. Servs., No. 14-CIV-22541, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84091 , [2015 BL 207549], 2015 WL 3952620 , at *3 (S.D. Fla. June 29, 2015) (noting where plaintiff does not reside in the forum state and seeks to represent a putative nationwide class, the general presumption in favor of a plaintiff's forum choice remains neutral).
Defendant argues little deference is owed to Plaintiff's choice of forum because Texas, not Florida, is RCDI's home forum. (See Mot. 6-7). Further, Defendant argues patent infringement cases brought somewhere other than a plaintiff's home forum are often transferred to the site of the defendant's center of management, development, testing, research, production, and marketing — where most of the operative facts likely are found. (See  id. 6 (citing Rothschild Storage Retrieval Innovations, LLC v. Sony Mobile Commc'ns (USA) Inc., No. 14-22652-CIV, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4867 , [2015 BL 10316], 2015 WL 224952 , at *6 (S.D. Fla. Jan. 15, 2015) ("RSRI"))).
Plaintiff insists "RCDI is a citizen of Florida that has sought judicial relief in its home district." (Resp. 10). "Infecting Coca-Cola's entire transfer analysis is the faulty premise that Miami, Florida is not RCDI's home. That assertion, however, [*4] is wrong. It disregards the rule of law that an LLC is deemed a citizen of the state where its members are citizens — not where the LLC was formed." ( Id. 8 (citing Rolling Greens MHP, L.P. v. Comcast SCH Holdings, L.L.C., 374 F.3d 1020 , 1022 (11th Cir. 2004))). Because Rothschild is the sole member of RCDI and a long-time resident of Miami, Plaintiff concludes "RCDI's formation in Texas is thus irrelevant." ( Id. 9). Similarly, Plaintiff would have the Court believe RCDI's recent filing of 59 patent cases in the Eastern District of Texas "of absolutely no relevance here." ( Id.).
The argument concerning RCDI's citizenship is misplaced here; in making it, Plaintiff plainly conflates venue and jurisdiction. Plaintiff asserts "[r]egardless of the state where it is organized, an LLC is deemed a citizen of the state where its members are citizens." ( Id. 4 (alteration added) (citing Rolling Greens MHP, L.P., 374 F.3d at 1022 )). In fact, Plaintiff does not just cite, but even directly quotes Rolling Greens, resulting in the following excerpt from the Response revealing the argument's shortcoming: "'This circuit has not previously decided how to determine the citizenship of a limited liability corporation for diversity jurisdiction purposes. We do so now. . . .' RCDI is thus deemed a citizen of Florida for venue purposes . . . ." ( Id. (alterations and emphases added) (quoting 374 F.3d at 1022 )). This is flatly incorrect; diversity jurisdiction is clearly not at issue here, so Rolling Greens is completely inapplicable. Citizenship for diversity purposes is separate from citizenship for venue.
Under 28 U.S.C. section 1391(c) , titled "Residency," "for all venue purposes," "an entity with the capacity to sue and be sued in its common name under applicable law, whether or not incorporated, shall be deemed to reside, . . . if a plaintiff, only in the judicial district in which it maintains its principal place of business." Id. § 1391(c)(2) (alteration and emphasis added). Accordingly, courts explicitly ignore the citizenship of a limited liability corporation's membership in determining citizenship for venue. See, e.g., Brownsberger v. Gexa Energy, LP, No. 10-CV-81021, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5214 , [2011 BL 15002], 2011 WL 197464 , at *5 n.3 (S.D. Fla. Jan. 20, 2011) (internal citations omitted), aff'd sub nom. Brownsberger v. Nextera Energy, Inc., 436 F. App'x 953 (11th Cir. 2011). Nonetheless, Plaintiff writes, "[i]n fact, the Texas Secretary of State's records reflect Mr. Rothschild's Florida address," as if this document vindicates its position rather than defeat it. (Resp. 9 n.1 (alteration added) (citing Ex. 2 ("Corporate Filings") [ECF No. 34-4] 3)). Instead, while that record does reflect Rothschild's "Original Address" is in Florida, it clearly lists RCDI — the Plaintiff in this case — as having its original and standard business addresses in Plano, Texas. (See Corporate Filings 2). Consequently, the Court accords Plaintiff's forum choice little deference, and this factor does not strongly weigh against transfer.1 See Capella Photonics, Inc. v. Cisco Sys., Inc., No. 14-20529-CIV, [2014 BL 203540], 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 100283 , [2014 BL 203540], 2014 WL 3673314 , at *6 (S.D. Fla. July 23, 2014).
b. Convenience of Witnesses and Limitations on Compelling Appearance of Witnesses 
The convenience of party and non-party witnesses is an important factor in the analysis whether to grant a motion to transfer. See Gonzalez v. Pirelli [*5] Tire, LLC, No. 07-80453-CIV, [2008 BL 296145], 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13492 , [2008 BL 296145], 2008 WL 516847 , at *2 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 22, 2008). The Court lacks compulsory process over unwilling witnesses, see Bell v. Kerzner Int'l Ltd., No. 10-23755-CIV, [2011 BL 421323], 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 155097 , [2011 BL 421323], 2011 WL 12656691 , at *9 (S.D. Fla. July 14, 2011), aff'd, 503 F. App'x 669 (11th Cir. 2012), and a federal court's subpoena powers are geographically limited, see FED. R. CIV. P. 45(c)(1) .
Defendant has identified six potential witnesses, at least five of whom are in Atlanta. (See [ECF No. 34-1] 5-6). In contrast, Defendant argues Plaintiff has only identified a single potential witness located in this District: Rothschild.2 (See Mot. 9). Of course both parties acknowledge this inquiry revolves more around the relevance of witnesses who would be inconvenienced than just the comparative sizes of the parties' witness lists. See Mason v. Smithkline Beecham Clinical Labs., 146 F. Supp. 2d 1355 , 1362 (S.D. Fla. 2001). Along that line, Defendant argues Rothschild's location is largely inconsequential for this factor, as courts have previously determined his testimony as the inventor is likely to be of little relevance and thus have minimal impact in this analysis. (See Mot. 7 (citing RSRI, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4867 , [2015 BL 10316], 2015 WL 224952 , at *4)). Compared to Defendant's six relevant potential witnesses in Atlanta, Defendant argues this factor weighs in favor of transfer. (See  id. 8-10).
Plaintiff does not contest the irrelevance of Rothschild's testimony. Instead, Plaintiff only challenges whether Defendant would truly be inconvenienced by transporting its six potential witnesses, and questions whether those witnesses have relevant testimony. (See Resp. 10-12). With regard to the burden, Plaintiff states "[p]arty-controlled witnesses are simply not a legally significant factor on a motion to transfer. On that basis alone, this factor is either neutral or weighs against transfer." ( Id. 10 (alteration added; emphasis in original; internal citations omitted)). Emphasis notwithstanding, Plaintiff misrepresents the holdings of the cases it cites for this proposition.3 It also fails to explain how "this basis alone" could result in this factor weighing against transfer, as opposed to simply remaining neutral.
As to relevant testimony, Plaintiff argues: "Three of the six witnesses listed by Coca-Cola will purportedly testify about marketing efforts related to the infringing products. Marketing efforts, even if somehow relevant to the question of infringement, would certainly not qualify as 'key.'" ( Id. 11 (internal citation omitted)). The Court agrees marketing is likely of little relevance to this action.4 Yet Plaintiff exaggerates how much of the potential testimony relates to marketing. True, it appears5 Eric Lewis and Scott Cuppari, both marketing directors for Coca-Cola Freestyle, would be able to testify to little more than marketing. (See [ECF No. 34-1] 6). But the remaining potential witnesses ostensibly have technical knowledge of the product, including the third witness Plaintiff dismisses as merely a marketing witness, Jennifer Mann; while this witness professes to have knowledge of marketing, as a former Vice President and General Manager for Coca-Cola Freestyle, her familiarity with "marketing, promotion, advertising, sales, [*6] technical, engineering, operations, and manufacturing related to the Freestyle Dispensing Platform" could well yield relevant testimony. ( Id.).
Plaintiff also discounts the value of a finance witness. (See Resp. 11). Yet even if the finance witness has no relevant testimony, that would still leave three witnesses with relevant testimony in Atlanta, and none in this District. On balance, then, this factor weighs slightly in favor of transfer.
c. Location of Relevant Documents and Relative Ease of Access to Sources of Proof 
Defendant argues this factor weighs strongly in favor of transfer because "'[i]n patent infringement cases, the bulk of the relevant evidence usually comes from the accused infringer. Consequently, the place where the defendant's documents are kept weighs in favor of transfer to that location.'" (Mot. 8 (alteration added) (quoting RSRI, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4867 , [2015 BL 10316], 2015 WL 224952 , at *5)). Indeed, Defendant asserts "[n]one of the documents and other evidence related to the function and operation of the Freestyle accused products are located in Florida. The vast majority of the evidence that will be produced in this litigation[] is . . . in Atlanta, Georgia." ( Id. 9 (alterations added)).
According to Plaintiff, "document production should be complete already" and "has been electronic, using an FTP site for file transfers." (Resp. 12). Therefore, "[b]ecause the bulk of the evidence and sources of proof in this matter are already in this District, and because any further production can take place electronically following Coca-Cola's prior procedures, this factor weighs squarely in favor of keeping the case in this District." ( Id. (alteration added)).
The Court agrees with Plaintiff's assertion this factor is of greatly diminished value on account of electronic discovery. See Matthews v. Whitewater W. Ind., Ltd., No. 11-24424-CIV, [2012 BL 113602], 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 64271 , [2012 BL 113602], 2012 WL 1605184 , at *7 n.6 (S.D. Fla. May 8, 2012); Beaman v. Maco Caribe, Inc., 790 F. Supp. 2d 1371 , 1377 (S.D. Fla. 2011). Nonetheless, Plaintiff completely fails to make any argument supporting its conclusion this factor "weighs squarely" against transfer; Plaintiff does not reference a single item of evidence or documentation in this District,6 as opposed to significant, if predominantly digital, documentation in Atlanta. This factor is of little significance or slightly favors transfer.
d. Convenience of the Parties 
Defendant argues the Northern District of Georgia is the most convenient forum for itself and contains most of the relevant evidence and witnesses. (See Mot. 10). As for Plaintiff's convenience, Defendant argues Atlanta is closer to Plaintiff's place of incorporation, Texas, than is Miami, and "RCDI clearly has no objection against litigating virtually identical claims outside of this District" because recently it "has filed 59 related actions in the Eastern District of Texas." ( Id.). Thus, Defendant argues this factor favors transfer because the Northern District of Georgia is "far more convenient for Coca-Cola and no less convenient for RCDI." ( Id.).
The entirety of Plaintiff's Response on this issue asserts Defendant's argument "is incorrect because it is based on a faulty premise. RCDI's residence [*7] is Florida, and its formation in Texas is inconsequential. This factor thus weighs against transfer." (Resp. 12-13). As above, Plaintiff is incorrect. And as also mentioned, negating Defendant's arguments — even if successful - only establishes a factor's neutrality; it is not, without more, itself an argument for a factor weighing against transfer.
In a separate section of the Response, Plaintiff also argues Defendant mischaracterizes the nature of the 59 suits in Texas, because they do not all involve both of the same patents at issue here, and Plaintiff fears Defendant therefore may have given the Court a "false impression" that "the Eastern District of Texas has ample working knowledge of the '377 patent and its claim terms." ( Id. 6). The Court's conclusion here has nothing to do with the Eastern District of Texas's familiarity with anything; rather, the Court agrees with Defendant these 59 suits in another district reveal Plaintiff is not substantially inconvenienced by patent litigation outside the Southern District of Florida. This factor weighs in favor of transfer.
e. Locus of Operative Facts 
Defendant argues the Northern District of Georgia is the locus of operative facts because "[t]he research, design, and development of the Freestyle accused products all occurred primarily at Coca-Cola's headquarters in Atlanta," and "Coca-Cola's employees in Atlanta were responsible for and directed the conception, design, development, and engineering for the overall functionality and technology used in the Freestyle accused products." (Mot. 10-11 (alteration added; record citation omitted)).
Plaintiff claims Defendant "grossly understates its activities in this District." (Resp. 5; see also  id. 13). As proof, Plaintiff describes in detail how important a market Miami was and is for the Freestyle products, with an emphasis on Defendant's substantial marketing efforts and commercial success in this District. (See  id. 13). Plaintiff informs the Court Defendant continues to deploy its product in Miami with three partners, has convened focus groups in Miami, and has received media coverage for its marketing efforts. (See id.). None of this matters. As Plaintiff itself notes just two pages earlier in its Response while objecting to the relevance of Defendant's proposed witnesses, there is no explanation for why Defendant's advertising efforts have anything to do with the outcome of this patent action. (See  id. 11 ("Marketing efforts, even if somehow relevant to the question of infringement, would certainly not qualify as 'key.'")). Plaintiff does claim Defendant "hired a design partner" based in Miami ( id. 13), but provides no indication this company's work was central to project development and/or somehow outweighs the bulk of the design and technical work which for years occurred in, and was managed from, Atlanta (see Mot. 9-10). Whether or not the Court utilizes the "center of gravity"7 approach, this factor weighs in favor of transfer — and provides another ground for according less deference to Plaintiff's forum selection. See Moghaddam, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14952 , 2002 WL 1940724 , at *3.
f. Relative [*8] Means of the Parties 
At first blush, the relative means of the parties appears to weigh in favor of retaining this action, as Defendant is a multinational corporate entity and Plaintiff is not. (See Resp. 14-15). However, given Plaintiff has filed at least 59 actions outside the Southern District of Florida in the last 14 months alone — in a forum twice as far from Miami as Atlanta — Plaintiff has demonstrated a willingness to litigate patents elsewhere. (See Ex 2. [ECF No. 34-4]). Accordingly, this factor only marginally weighs against transfer. See RSRI, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4867 , [2015 BL 10316], 2015 WL 224952 , at *6. In sum, the private factors weigh strongly in favor of transfer.
3. The Public Interest Factors Weigh in Favor of Transfer 
Public factors include the chosen forum's familiarity with governing law, trial efficiency, and the interests of justice. See Manuel, 430 F.3d at 1135 n.1. Courts also consider administrative difficulties flowing from court congestion, the local interest in having localized controversies decided at home, the avoidance of unnecessary problems in conflict of laws or application of foreign law, and the unfairness in imposing jury duty on citizens in an unrelated forum. ShadeFX Canopies, Inc. v. Country Lane Gazebos, LLC, No. 13-80239-CIV, [2013 BL 372902], 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 188993 , [2013 BL 372902], 2013 WL 9827411 , at *2 (S.D. Fla. June 14, 2013) (citation omitted).
a. Forum's Familiarity with Governing Law 
This factor is of little value regarding an action grounded solely in federal law. Accordingly, it does not weigh against transfer.
b. Trial Efficiency and Interests of Justice in Totality 
Defendant maintains court congestion favors transfer because this District has one of the busiest dockets in the country, and thus the interests of justice are not well served by retaining cases that could have been filed elsewhere on less congested dockets and have "virtually no meaningful connection to the District." (Mot. 13). Defendant also argues, "[t]he Northern District of Georgia has a legitimate interest in the outcome of this litigation, because that is where economic harm would result from a finding of liability." ( Id. (alteration added) (citing RSRI, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4867 , [2015 BL 10316], 2015 WL 224952 , at *4)). The Court agrees.
Plaintiff insists "[t]rial efficiency and the interests of justice strongly favor keeping the case in this forum." (Resp. 15 (alteration added)). Plaintiff makes a number of arguments on this front, such as expressing concern for duplication of judicial effort. (See id.). This last point fails to persuade, as the Court's only substantive involvement to date has been this Order, and the only effort the Northern District of Georgia would be required to duplicate is issuing a scheduling order. Plaintiff focuses more on a transfer's potential effect on timing, arguing "transfer at this stage of the proceedings will result in significant administrative delay" and "a total loss of the February 2017 trial date." ( Id. (emphasis in original)). Plaintiff goes so far as to suggest transfer would delay trial until November of 2018. (See id.). This argument is disingenuous. Plaintiff arrives at this date by assuming, upon transfer, the parties would begin at square one, completely disregarding what [*9] discovery and initial claim construction efforts have been completed to date.
Similarly, Plaintiff argues "the ongoing claim construction briefing and the imminence of the Markman hearing in just three weeks weigh very heavily against transfer" ( id. 15), because "transfer to Atlanta would reset not just the trial period, but the entire Markman process" ( id. 16). Again, this argument rings needlessly melodramatic. Provided Plaintiff does not shred its briefing and wipe its hard drives upon receipt of this Order, the parties will arrive in Atlanta exactly as prepared for their Markman hearing as they are today. Accordingly, there is no reason why the parties could not advise the Northern District of Georgia of what progress has occurred in this District and even request the same trial date they were given here. In sum, the public interest factors also weigh in favor of transfer.
* * *
Based on the foregoing section 1404(a) analysis, the Court finds both the private factors and the less-important public interest factors weigh in favor of transfer to the Northern District of Georgia. Particularly in light of Plaintiff's selection of this District rather than its home forum, Defendant has met its burden of establishing the balance of factors strongly favors transfer.
IV. CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, it is
ORDERED AND ADJUDGED as follows:
1. The Motion [ECF No. 34] is GRANTED. 
2. The Clerk is directed to transfer this proceeding to the Northern District of Georgia, and mark this case as CLOSED in this District.

DONE AND ORDERED in Miami, Florida this 15th day of April, 2016.

Discussed as a separate factor below, Defendant also convincingly argues the locus of operative facts is in the Northern District of Georgia (see Mot. 10-11), which provides an additional ground to give diminished deference to Plaintiff's forum selection, see Moghaddam, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14952 , 2002 WL 1940724 , at *3.

In a separate section of the Response, despite having previously named only a single potential witness in the District, Plaintiff raises the prospect of calling Royal Caribbean Cruises, Ltd. ("RCCL") as a third-party witness residing in Miami — outside the subpoena power of the Northern District of Georgia. (See Resp. 14). Plaintiff argues RCCL has "intimate knowledge of the infringing products" and "is a key witness because it has deployed the dispensers throughout its cruise ships." ( Id.). Plaintiff then attempts to further expand its potential witness list: "Other early adopters of the Freestyle dispenser include Miami Subs Grill and Burger King Corporation, both based in this District, and both of whom have likely made similar modifications to their beverage dispensers. Only this District is vested with the power to issue subpoenas and enforce these witnesses' attendance at trial." ( Id.).
Assuming RCCL and other dispenser customers have "intimate knowledge" from their involvement as "early adopters," Plaintiff fails to explain how their testimony would be both relevant to this action regarding Coca-Cola's alleged patent infringement, and not duplicative of Coca-Cola's presumably superior knowledge of its own product development. While the language RCCL and others "made similar modifications" insinuates their active involvement in product development (see id.), to the extent Plaintiff wishes to make this argument, testimony regarding modifications made by RCCL and other companies would seem relevant only as to legal action regarding their own alleged patent infringements. In short, this argument — even if properly made — does not alter the Court's analysis.

HollyAnne Corporation v. TFT, Incorporated does not hold inconvenience to a party's employees is "not a legally significant factor"; rather, it states in dicta "[employees'] location is not as important a factor as it would be if they were not under the defendant's control." 199 F.3d 1304 , 1307 n.2 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (alteration added). Similarly, to the extent the other two cited cases speak to this issue, they appear to comment on concerns for a court's subpoena power, not witnesses' relative convenience. See Ward v. Kerzner Int'l Hotels Ltd., No. 03-23087-CIV, [2005 BL 14522], 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11081 , [2005 BL 14522], 2005 WL 2456191 , at *3 (S.D. Fla. Mar. 30, 2005); Ashmore v. Ne. Petroleum Div. of Cargill, Inc., 925 F. Supp. 36 , 38 (D. Me. 1996).

That said, the Court finds it odd Plaintiff would make this argument just before resting nearly its entire position regarding Defendant's involvement with the District on marketing activities, as discussed below.

fn 
5
The Court agrees with Plaintiff's lament this list includes only job descriptions and areas of knowledge, as opposed to areas of anticipated testimony. (See Resp. 11). The list is also sloppy: the entry for Scott Cuppari appears to accidentally include an entry for an as-of-yet unnamed "Director of Electronics Systems Group for the Coca-Cola Freestyle," who would seem likely to have relevant testimony but has been omitted. (See [ECF No. 34-1] 6).

fn 
6
As far as can be gleaned from the parties' submissions, to the extent relevant documents currently reside in this District, they do so primarily because they have been produced by Defendant. (See Resp. 4).

fn 
7
Defendant notes "several district courts" have employed the "center of gravity" test in transfers of patent cases (Mot. 10), including some within this District, see, e.g., RSRI, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4867 , [2015 BL 10316], 2015 WL 224952 , at *5. Plaintiff argues the Eleventh Circuit has not adopted this test, so it should not supplant the conventional locus of operative facts analysis. (See Resp. 9). For this case, this is a distinction without a difference, as Plaintiff fails to show the locus of operative facts lies anywhere but in the Northern District of Georgia.

January 28, 2015, Filed January 28, 2015, Decided 
For Advantor Systems Corporation, a Florida Corporation, Plaintiff: Lauren Lynn Millcarek, LEAD ATTORNEY, Holland & Knight, LLP - Orlando, Orlando, FL; Min K. Cho, LEAD ATTORNEY, Holland & Knight, LLP, Orlando, FL; Brandon Elledge, PRO HAC VICE, Holland & Knight, LLP, Tysons Corner, VA.

DAVID A. BAKER, UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE.

DAVID A. BAKER 
Order 
This cause came on for consideration with oral argument on the following motions filed herein:
MOTION: MOTION FOR SANCTIONS AGAINST DEFENDANT FOR SPOLIATION OF EVIDENCE (Doc. No. 40) 
FILED: October 7, 2014 
THEREON it is ORDERED that the motion is DENIED for the reasons set forth below.
MOTION: MOTION TO COMPEL ANSWER TO INTERROGATORY 12 AND TO PRODUCE CERTAIN DOCUMENTS (Doc. No. 47) 
FILED: November 5, 2014 
THEREON it is ORDERED that the motion is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part as set forth below. DRS is ORDERED to produce the billing information for, compensation paid to, and time spent on projects by Larson, Ellfeldt, and Alvarez; the Motion is DENIED in all other respects.

Plaintiff Advantor Systems Corporation filed suit against Defendant DRS Technical Services, Inc. asserting a breach of contract claim for the alleged "poaching" by DRS of Advantor's employees and the receipt and potential use of Advantor's proprietary information in violation of the parties' Nondisclosure Agreement. Doc. 1. Advantor has since filed an Amended Complaint asserting additional claims against DRS for tortious interference with the contracts of three former Advantor employees — Greg Larson, John Ellfeldt, and Axel Alavarez. Doc. 32. Advantor now moves for sanctions against Defendant DRS Technical Services, Inc., for its intentional bad faith spoliation of evidence. Based on the materials submitted and the arguments made at the hearing1, the Court finds that sanctions are not warranted.
Factual Background 
Advantor is a security technology company that provides computer-based security services2 that meet the specifications and requirements of its customers, including the United States Air Force Major Commands and Reserve Components, which represents the largest single customer group for Advantor. Doc. 32 ¶ 7. Advantor is one of only three security systems manufacturers certified by the United States Air Force to produce the equipment and software to protect priority level resources; Advantor additionally provides the installation, training and ongoing logistics support for the maintenance and testing of the systems. Doc. 32 ¶ 7. Defendant DRS also provides security system services, including maintenance of security equipment to defense organizations such as the United States Air Force, as one of [*2] many companies3 that provide security equipment located at certain Air Force bases. Doc. 34 at 1; Doc. 34 at 17, Coen Aff. ¶ 6.
In July 2013, DRS received notice that the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command ("SPAWAR") might be issuing a request for proposals ("RFP") for the maintenance of intrusion detection systems at various Air Force bases. Coen Aff. ¶ 6. On July 17, 2013, DRS and Advantor entered into a written Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement (the "NDA" or the "Agreement"), based on DRS's form document, since the parties contemplated working together on the SPAWAR Project, with DRS as the prime contractor and Advantor as the subcontractor. See Doc. 32-1; Doc. 32 ¶ 8; Coen Aff. ¶ 12.
Among other things, the NDA between DRS and Advantor contained several relevant clauses which provided as follows:
9. This Agreement should not be construed as a sales agreement, teaming agreement, joint venture or similar arrangement.
10. Neither Party has an obligation to supply Proprietary Information to the other Party; furthermore, neither Party has an obligation under this Agreement to purchase any item or service from the other Party.
* * *
14. Upon written request of the disclosing Party, the receiving Party shall return all originals, copies, reproductions and summaries of Proprietary Information in the receiving Party's possession or control or, at the disclosing Party's option, destroy and certify to such destruction.
15. The Parties agree that, during the term of this Agreement and for a one (1) year period thereafter, neither Party shall knowingly or actively seek to hire any employee of the other Party. This restriction shall not prohibit either Party from hiring any person as a result of the use of an independent employment agency (so long as the agency was not directed by such party to solicit such person) or as the result of the use of a general solicitation (such as an advertisement) not specifically directed to employees of the other Party.
Doc. 32, Am. Comp., Exhibit A at ¶¶ 9, 10, 14, 15. Doc. 32 ¶ 10.

On August 20, 2013, SPAWAR officially issued the RFP. Coen Aff. ¶ 12. The RFP permitted awardees to include subcontractors as part of their bid. Coen Aff. ¶ 13. DRS contacted Advantor and other manufacturers, including Open Roads Consulting, Inc., Diebold, and Honeywell. The responses to the RFP were due no later than September 12, 2013. Coen Aff. ¶ 13. DRS's position is that, despite its many requests, Advantor never provided DRS with all of the information necessary to include Advantor as a subcontractor in the bid and DRS was forced to submit its bid on September 12, 2013, without Advantor as a subcontractor; for subcontractors to be approved, SPAWAR required very specific information to be submitted, including pricing data in a particular format. Coen Aff. ¶ 16-18.
On September 30, 2013, DRS was awarded the SPAWAR Project. Doc. 32 ¶ 11; Doc. 34 at Coen Aff. ¶ 20. DRS contends that, since Advantor was not approved by SPAWAR, it could not work on the IBDSS contract as a subcontractor. Coen Aff. ¶ 23-27. Advantor's theory of the case is that DRS planned to "self-perform" on the SPAWAR Project by recruiting Advantor's certified [*3] personnel after excluding Advantor from the Project. Doc. 28. The parties dispute the efforts made to work together after the SPAWAR Project was awarded.
DRS subsequently informed Advantor in October 2013 that DRS had employed or offered employment to three recent Advantor employees. Doc. 32 ¶ 15. Advantor learned that DRS had hired Axel Alvarez (an ESS Administrator), Greg Larson (a Senior Field Trainer), and John Ellfeldt (a Lead Installer), allegedly in violation of the Non-Disclosure Agreement. Doc. 32 ¶¶ 16, 28.
All three former Advantor employees resigned in November 2013. Doc. 32 ¶¶ 25-27. Advantor alleges that Mr. Larson had access to Advantor's proprietary information and, once he was hired by DRS, provided certain files to DRS4. Doc. 32 ¶¶ 26, 33-41; Doc. 28-4 at 18-24. Advantor also alleges that DRS in fall of 2013 posted a job description on Monster.com specifically targeting Advantor employees by mentioning ESS programs and requiring experience with Advantor's IDS equipment. Doc. 32 ¶ 30. On March 18, 2014, DRS issued its notice of termination of the NDA. Doc. 32 ¶ 48.
Advantor filed suit on April 3, 2014, and discovery in the lawsuit subsequently began. After conducting some discovery, on October 7, 2014, Advantor filed its Motion for Sanctions against Defendant for Spoliation of Evidence, i.e., the reformatting of the laptop used by Greg Larson during the brief time he was employed by DRS5. Doc. 40. Most of the background facts and the dates surrounding Larson's hiring and possession of the DRS laptop are not disputed. Larson was a Senior Field Trainer for Advantor's certified IDS systems, with access to Advantor's proprietary information. Doc. 32 at ¶ 20.
Larson had a confidentiality agreement with Advantor which prohibited him from using, appropriating, or disclosing Advantor's confidential information to any person or entity other than in connection with his position and for the benefit of Advantor; it also prohibited him from removing such information unless in connection with his employment with and for the benefit of Advantor and required him, upon termination or resignation, to immediately return all confidential information in his possession, whether on his person or at any other location6. Doc. No. 32-2.
Putting aside for the moment the dispute over how DRS recruited and hired the former Advantor employees, it is undisputed that Larson resigned from Advantor on November 10, 2013 and was hired by DRS on November 18, 2013. Doc. 40-2 (McNeill Decl.) ¶ 3; Doc. 57-22, Larson Ex. 91 ¶7. Larson received the laptop from DRS on November 21, 2013. Doc. 57-25, Larson Dep. (p. 199). Advantor learned of Larson's hiring and sent a letter on November 22, 2013 to DRS stating:
Demand is hereby made that DRS immediately terminate its relationship with Mr. Larson, provide Advantor with written notice of such termination, and take all steps necessary to identify, preserve (without alteration), and return to Advantor all confidential and/or proprietary information of Advantor including without limitation, all documents (including any electronically stored information or [*4] other data generated by and/or stored on DRS' computers and other storage media), in DRS' possession, custody, or control.
Doc. 40, Ex. B-1. On December 3, 2013, DRS conducted an investigation and on December 10, DRS terminated Larson's employment. Doc. 56-1, Coen Aff. ¶¶ 60-63. On December 12, 2013, Larson's DRS laptop was reformatted, and, on January 6, 2014, it was issued to a new employee, as part of the company's normal, established routine. Doc. 56-2, Torrico Aff. ¶¶ 6-7. The parties engaged in discussions in January 2014 about the return of eight files7 that Larson had sent to DRS employees in October 2013. Doc. 40, Ex. B; Doc. 32 ¶ 33-39.

Discussions between the parties broke down, and Advantor subsequently filed suit against DRS in April 2014, having sent a second preservation notice in March 2014. Doc. 40-11 (Letter from B. Elledge). Following a discussion between the parties in June 2014, when DRS confirmed that Larson's laptop hard drive had been reformatted and a new operating system installed by DRS (Doc. 40, Ex. E, F), an extensive investigation of Larson's DRS computer hard drive followed, with the assistance of the parties' respective computer forensic experts. DRS, through its computer expert and beginning in July 2014, produced listings of file and folder names that had been on Larson's DRS computer. Doc. 40. However, as noted by DRS in the parties' later filed Joint 502(d) Order Motion, much of Larson's reformatted computer was determined to be "nearly unreadable" and "[t]he detection of protected information under these circumstances with ESI in this condition is extremely difficult." Doc. 36 at ¶ 5. In late July 2014, DRS made a production of "files" from the Larson computer, but the files were overwhelmingly, if not totally, corrupted or otherwise not able to be processed or opened due to the reformatting. Doc. 40-7.
Advantor's computer forensic expert independently found, in September 2013, an even longer list of files that had once existed on Larson's DRS computer during his late 2013 employment period. See Doc. 40-8 (file list). The parties do not dispute that the contents of the files on these lists (from DRS and Advantor experts) were not recoverable due to the reformatting and installation of a new operating system that occurred on the machine. Doc. 40-9 Supp. Sun Decl. ¶¶ 6-7, 9-10. Advantor believed, based on its review of the file names that these files appeared to be proprietary to Advantor or to have come from Advantor's computer systems. Doc. 40-10 (Whirley Decl.) ¶¶ 3-8.
Advantor filed its Motion for Sanctions on October 7, 2014, alleging that spoliation of Larson's DRS computer had occurred and submitted the March 28, 2014 Declaration of Gregory A. Larson in support of Advantor's Motion. Docs. 40, 40-3. Larson stated that he had sent Advantor information to a DRS recruiter (Ms. Morrison), including training manuals on October 5-6, 2013 (before he was hired). Doc. 40-3 (Larson Decl.) ¶ 5. Larson also stated that "DRS, through Coen, further advised me how to terminate my employment with Advantor, specifically telling me to give no advance notice of my resignation with Advantor. Coen advised me to exit my employment [*5] this way because of my access to Advantor documentation and with the intent and understanding that such information would be shared with DRS." Doc. 40-3 ¶ 10. "Coen specifically told me to not dispose of Advantor information, that it was fine to have Advantor information at my house, and to be careful not to bring it on the Air Force base." Id. According to Larson, DRS wanted him to come to Vance Air Force Base as soon as possible to begin work on the SPAWAR project for DRS, which he did beginning December 2, 2013, although DRS began paying him before that, as of November 18, 2013, when he was in the process of moving to Vance Air Force Base in Oklahoma; the first day he could be on site at Vance AFB for DRS was December 2, 2013. Id. ¶ 12.
Though the precise nature of a resolution of the dispute between Advantor and Mr. Larson is not crystal clear8, they appear to have reached some sort of agreement which led Advantor to provide (among other things) a proposed affidavit for him to sign. Doc. 57-1 (Larson Dep. Ex. 8). In Mr. Larson's January 27, 2014 Affidavit he states that he only sent, via e-mail, the eight allegedly-proprietary Advantor documents, (which DRS returned) and he did not distribute any information or documents to any other person. Doc. 57-2. He also noted through interlineation his opinion that he did not consider the documents to be confidential as they were publically accessible or taken word for word from manufacturer's manuals, and he signed "documents [with] additions to prevent self-incrimination (5th amendment right) and he had returned Advantor documents and CD/DVD's in his custody. Doc. 57-2. Advantor did not produce Larson's January 27, 2014 Affidavit until approximately ten months later when Larson was initially scheduled to be deposed in October 2104. Doc. 56 at 7.
When Larson was deposed, on November 18 to 19, 2014, he testified that he had only used his DRS-issued laptop for 3 days (Doc. 57-25 at 237) and he did not remember loading anything from his Advantor employment on his DRS-issued laptop. Doc. 57-26 at 312. He testified that he did not recall anyone taking any documents from the computer with a thumb drive or other device and no one other than him had accessed his DRS-issued laptop ( Id. at 313); Larson had some discs and manuals when he left Advantor but they were in a box while he was moving from Florida to Oklahoma, and he testified that he returned them to Advantor.  Id. at 71, 76-81, 294-95. Larson stated in an e-mail to Advantor: "So if you read this correctly, I only worked for [DRS] for two weeks before being terminated and I sent them nothing because they flat out ignored me up until firing me. Advantor can rest assured that DRS does not have their manuals or documents, at least not from me." Doc. 57-26 at 441; Doc. 57-24.
Larson testified, between November 20, 2013 and December 10, 2013 — for the three days he was not traveling and he used the computer -- he had saved documents on his DRS-issued laptop that he needed for his job. Doc. 57-25 at 237. Larson also testified that the file names from Advantor's list (created by its expert) found in Larson's DRS-issued laptop were names of documents, [*6] obtained by Larson from the internet, given to him by someone on the Air Force base, were authored or created by a non-Advantor entity such as the government, or related to Advantor's legal case against him. Doc. 57-25 at 220-226, 228-232, 251-271, Exs. 77-89. Other than the list of documents identified by Advantor and DRS's forensic experts, which were shown to him during his deposition, Larson does not recall saving any other documents to his DRS-issued laptop in the days he used it; his belief was that none of the documents were confidential, proprietary or constituted trade secrets of Advantor. Doc. 57-26 at 246. Larson spoke to Advantor's attorneys three or four times and they did not ask him what he had on his laptop. Doc. 57-25, Larson Dep. (pp. 247, 249). Larson's DRS-issued laptop was retrieved on December 10, 2013 by DRS. Doc. 57-25, Larson Dep. (p. 236). According to DRS, all email and attachments are stored on DRS' central email servers, not individual computers, and the email that may have been located on the local hard drive would be duplicative of email stored and preserved on the server. Doc. 40-6 at 3.
Analysis 
Standards 
"Spoliation" is the "intentional destruction, mutilation, alteration, or concealment of evidence." Blacks Law Dictionary 1437 (8th Ed. 2004). Federal law, not state law, controls the imposition of sanctions for failure to preserve evidence in a diversity case. See Flury v. Daimler Chrysler Corp., 427 F.3d 939 (11th Cir. 2005) (federal law governs the imposition of spoliation sanctions), cert. denied, 548 U.S. 903 , 126 S. Ct. 2967 , 165 L. Ed. 2d 950 (2006); see also King v. Illinois Central R.R. Co. 337 F.3d 550 , 556 (5th Cir. 2003) (same); Assimack v. J.C. Penney Corp., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20463 , 2005 WL 2219422 , *2 (M.D. Fla.. 2005) (same). The Court has broad discretion to impose sanctions derived from its inherent power to manage its own affairs and to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of cases. Id. at 944 (citing Chambers, 501 U.S. at 43 ). Sanctions for discovery abuses are intended to prevent unfair prejudice to litigants and to insure the integrity of the discovery process. Id. The courts have the inherent power to enter sanctions as punishment for a defendant's destruction of documents:
Sanctions may be imposed against a litigant who is on notice that documents and information in its possession are relevant to litigation, or potential litigation, or are reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, and destroys such documents and information. While a litigant is under no duty to keep or retain every document in its possession once a complaint is filed, it is under a duty to preserve what it knows, or reasonably should know, is relevant in the action, is reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, is reasonably likely to be requested during discovery, and/or is the subject of a pending discovery request.
Telectron, Inc. v. Overhead Door Corp., 116 F.R.D. 107 , 126 (S.D. Fla. 1987) (quoting Wm. T. Thompson v. General Nutrition, 593 F.Supp. 1443 , 1455 (C.D. Cal. 1984)).

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37 also authorizes a panoply of sanctions for a party's failure to comply with the rules of discovery. [*7] Subsection (d) provides that where a party fails to serve a written response to a request for inspection submitted under Rule 34, after proper service of the request, the court may order sanctions, including those actions authorized by Rule 37(b)(2)(A)(i)-(vi), which provide the following remedies: (i) directing that the matters embraced in the order or other designated facts be taken as established for purposes of the action, as the prevailing party claims; (ii) prohibiting the disobedient party from supporting or opposing designated claims or defenses, or from introducing designated matters in evidence; (iii) striking pleadings in whole or in part; (iv) staying further proceedings until the order is obeyed; (v) dismissing the action or proceeding in whole or in part; or (vi) rendering a default judgment against the disobedient party; Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b) . Although Rule 37(b) applies when a party fails to comply with a court order, Rule 37(d)'s requirement that a party participate in discovery that is not regulated by the court expressly adopts most of the sanctions in Rule 37(b)(2), including the power to grant a default judgment. See Telectron, 116 F.R.D. at 128-29 n. 8.
Although federal law controls spoliation sanctions, the Court's opinion may be "informed" by state law, as long as it is consistent with federal law, because federal law in the Eleventh Circuit does not set forth specific guidelines on spoliation. Flury, 427 F.3d at 944 . Under Florida law, the remedy for a party failing to produce crucial but unfavorable evidence that is destroyed or inexplicably disappears is an adverse inference or discovery sanctions. Martino v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 908 So.2d 342 (Fla. 2005). Prior to the court exercising any leveling mechanism due to spoliation of evidence, the court must decide: 1) whether the evidence existed at one time, 2) whether the spoliator had a duty to preserve the evidence, and 3) whether the evidence was critical to an opposing party being able to prove its prima facie case or a defense. Smith v. Sohaan Dev., Inc. No. 6:12-cv-1369-Orl-18DAB, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150849 , 2013 WL 5720163 at *2 (M.D.Fa. Oct. 1, 2013) (citing Golden Yachts, Inc. v. Hall, 920 So.2d 777 , 781 (Fla. 4th DCA 2006)); see Flury, 427 F.3d at 944 (applying Georgia spoliation and sanctions law).
In addition to the factors applied by Florida courts, under federal law in the Eleventh Circuit, the most severe sanction of default, for instance, should be exercised only when there is a showing of bad faith and lesser sanctions will not suffice. See Flury, 427 F.3d at 944-45 ; see also Aldrich v. Roche Biomedical Laboratories, 737 So.2d 1124 , 1125 (Fla. 5th DCA 1999) (the appropriate sanction when a party fails to preserve evidence in its custody depends on the willfulness or bad faith of the party responsible), rev. denied, 751 So.2d 1250 (Fla. 2000). An adverse inference is drawn from a party's failure to preserve evidence only when the absence of that evidence is predicated on bad faith; thus, negligence in losing or destroying records is not enough for an adverse inference, as "'it does not sustain an inference of consciousness of a weak case.'" Bashir v. Amtrak, 119 F.3d 929 [*8] , 931 (11th Cir. 1997) (quoting Vick v. Texas Employment Comm'n, 514 F.2d 734 , 737 (5th Cir. 1975)). The Court should not infer that the missing evidence was unfavorable unless the circumstances surrounding the evidence's absence indicate bad faith. Id.
Application 
Duty to Preserve 
Based on the facts as presented in the moving papers and the Response, and as the Court stated at the hearing, under the facts of this case, DRS had a duty to preserve the contents of the Larson laptop as of November 22, 2013, once DRS received notice from Advantor that it was contesting the hiring of Larson. "[O]nce a party reasonably anticipates litigation, it has an obligation to make a conscientious effort to preserve electronically stored information that would be relevant to the dispute." United States v. DSE, Inc., No. 8:08-cv-2416-T-23EAJ, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22245 , 2013 WL 610531 , at *7 (M.D. Fla. Jan. 17, 2013); Simon Prop. Group, Inc. v. Lauria, No. 6:11-cv-01598-0rl-3 lKRS, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 184638 , 2012 WL 6859404 , at *6 (M.D. Fla. Dec. 13, 2012), adopting Report and Recommendation, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5945 , 2013 WL 152525 (M.D. Fla. Jan. 15, 2013) ( Presnell, J.). The preservation notice Advantor sent on November 22, 2013 was clear, litigation should have been reasonably anticipated, and DRS had an obligation to preserve Larson's DRS laptop. At the hearing, when the Court questioned why DRS had chosen not to preserve the laptop, counsel for DRS explained the failure to preserve was simply a "mistake" by in-house counsel.
Unlike some cases, the identification of ESI and its preservation here would have been easy and straight-forward. No designation of likely custodians or deep search of servers and archives was necessary. Larson's laptop was already in hand and could, without meaningful effort, have been preserved or forensically copied. The failure to take the obvious steps to preserve the evidence while taking serious action to terminate an employee is mystifying. Nonetheless, that decision does not appear to be the product of any actual intent to destroy specific evidence inasmuch as there is no indication that anyone from DRS ever even knew what was on the laptop.
Advantor does argue that many of the file names found on the listing of file names that its computer forensic expert (Mr. Sun) had independently found as once existing on Larson's DRS computer during his November-December 2013 employment period were suspiciously not found by DRS's computer forensic expert as having been on Larson's DRS laptop. Doc. 40-9 ¶¶ 8-9. Advantor also argues that many of these files appear to be proprietary to Advantor or to have come from Advantor's computer systems. Nonetheless, from Larson's testimony and the circumstances of his brief employment, these suspicions do not rise to the level of inference that anything of significance was compromised.
DRS argues that, without a showing that Larson's DRS laptop contained relevant and crucial information, Advantor's Motion fails. DRS argues that, despite having access to Larson and obtaining his March 2014 Affidavit, Advantor's argument is based upon pure speculation, and that Advantor has failed to provide evidence that Larson provided [*9] Advantor's confidential documents to DRS once saved or from his DRS-issued laptop. DRS also points out Mr. Larson's revisions to the proposed January 27, 2014 affidavit prepared by Advantor's lawyers contradicts Larson's later March Affidavit and does not support Advantor's Motion.
Based on the record as a whole, there is no real likelihood that important or protected files were ever on Larson's DRS computer. Further, even if there were some files copied onto the laptop that should not have been, there is no showing that they ever went anywhere that could harm Advantor's legally protected interests. Advantor has failed to show that there was any evidence on Larson's DRS laptop or that the evidence (if any) was critical to being able to litigate the issues in this case. Under these circumstances, despite the essentially unexplained reformatting of Larson's laptop, no sanctions are warranted.
Each party shall bear its own motion costs.

JOHN J. O'SULLIVAN 
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
THIS CAUSE is before the Court following an evidentiary show cause hearing held before the undersigned on October 15, 2015. This matter was referred to the undersigned by the Honorable Cecilia M. Altonaga, United States District Court Judge for the Southern District of Florida, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b) . The undersigned previously held a show cause hearing in this matter on September 16, 2015, and previously recommended that the United States' Motion for Sanctions Pursuant to Rule 37(b) (DE # 37, 7/8/15) be granted and that the Court strike the defendant Lucvens Francois' answer to the complaint and that a default be entered against Mr. Francois as a sanction for failing to comply with this Court's Orders. Having held another show cause hearing in this matter on October 15, 2015, and for the reasons stated on the record during the October 15, 2015, show cause hearing, the undersigned persists in his prior recommendation and respectfully RECOMMENDS that the United States' Motion for Sanctions Pursuant to Rule 37(b) (DE # 37, 7/8/15) be granted and that the Court strike defendant Lucvens Francois' answer to the complaint and that a default be entered against Mr. Francois as a sanction for failing to comply with this Court's Orders.
BACKGROUND
On March 12, 2015, the undersigned issued an Order in this matter (DE # 26, 3/12/15) in which the Court required the defendant to provide certain discovery responses to the government including copies of tax returns. On April 21, 2015, the undersigned issued an Order (DE # 29, 4/21/15) requiring electronic discovery of tax returns to be provided by the defendant to the plaintiff. On May 26, 2015, the undersigned issued an Order (DE # 32, 5/26/15) requiring the defendant to either provide the government with certain discovery responses, including tax returns, or submit a memorandum of law as to the applicability of the 5th Amendment privilege to this case. A memorandum of law was not submitted to the Court.
On July 8, 2015, the plaintiff filed United States' Motion for Sanctions Pursuant to Rule 37(b) (DE # 37, 7/8/15) seeking sanctions against Mr. Francois for his failure to comply with three discovery Orders: Order (DE# 26, 3/12/15), Order (DE# 29, 4/21/15) and Order (DE# 32, 5/26/15). Mr. Francois did not file a response to the plaintiff's motion and on August 11, 2015, the undersigned [*2] issued an Order and Notice of Hearing (DE# 55, 8/11/15) requiring Mr. Francois to file a written response to the plaintiff's motion. The Order (DE# 55) warned Mr. Francois that "[t]he failure to file a response may result in an Order that United States' Motion for Sanctions Pursuant to Rule 37(b) (DE # 37, 7/8/15) be granted in its entirety." See Order (DE# 55 at 1, 8/11/15). The Order (DE# 55) also set the sanctions motion for hearing on September 1, 2015 before the undersigned.
Mr. Francois failed to file a response to the sanctions motion and did not appear at the September 1, 2015 hearing. Following the September 1, 2015 hearing, the undersigned issued an Order and Notice of Hearing (DE# 60, 9/1/15). The Order (DE# 60) required that by September 8, 2015, Mr. Francois provide certain discovery documents to the plaintiff and further required Mr. Francois to:
file with this Court a memorandum addressing why the defendant should not be held in contempt of court for failure and refusal to abide by the Court's August 11, 2015, Order (DE # 55) in this case, the Court's March 12, 2015, Order (DE # 26) in this case, the Court's April 21, 2015, Order (DE # 29) in this case, and the Court's May 26, 2015, Order (DE # 32) in this case. The defendant shall also address in the memorandum why his answer to the complaint in this matter should not be stricken, and why a default judgment should not be entered against him.
Order (DE# 60 at 2, 9/1/15).

The Order (DE# 60) also set a show cause hearing before the undersigned on September 16, 2015. With respect to the September 16, 2015 show cause hearing, the Order (DE# 60) stated:
LUCVENS FRANCOIS, shall be present, in person, at the hearing and shall be prepared to discuss why he failed to comply with Orders of this Court, why his answer to the complaint in this matter should not be stricken, and why a default judgment should not be entered against him.
Id. at 2. The Order (DE# 60) warned Mr. Francois that:
the failure of the defendant to appear in person before the undersigned for the aforementioned hearing or the failure of the defendant to file the aforementioned memorandum, may result in a recommendation that the defendant be held in contempt and sanctions be imposed, including, but not limited to, the defendant's answer to the complaint in this matter being stricken, a default judgment be entered against the defendant, monetary fines being assessed against the defendant, and/or incarceration of the defendant.
Id. at 2-3.

On September 8, 2015, Mr. Francois filed a document entitled Constructive Notice of Conditional Acceptance (DE# 61, 9/9/15). The document states that Mr. Francois failed to appear at the September 1, 2015 hearing because the Court failed to properly notify him of the hearing. The undersigned notes that the Court's CM/ECF system indicates that the Order (DE# 55) setting the September 1, 2015 hearing was mailed to the address on record for Mr. Francois.
It is clear from the Constructive Notice of Conditional Acceptance (DE# 61 at 1, 9/9/15), that Mr. Francois did receive the September 1, 2015 Order (DE# 60) which required his appearance in Court on September 16, 2015. The September 1, 2015 Order (DE# 60) warned Mr. Francois [*3] that he could be subject to sanctions including the striking of his answer to the complaint and the entry of a default judgment against him if he failed to comply with the Order (DE# 60). See supra.
On September 16, 2015, the Court held a show cause hearing. The hearing was noticed for 9:00 AM. The Court waited until 9:22 AM and Mr. Francois failed to appear. At the hearing, the plaintiff represented to the Court that it had not received from Mr. Francois the discovery documents ordered to be produced in this Court's prior Orders. The undersigned issued a Report and Recommendation on September 16, 2015, (DE # 63) recommending that the United States' Motion for Sanctions Pursuant to Rule 37(b) (DE # 37, 7/8/15) be granted and that the Court strike defendant Lucvens Francois' answer to the complaint and that a default be entered against Mr. Francois as a sanction for failing to comply with this Court's Orders
On September 21, 2015, the defendant filed a Motion (DE # 64, 9/21/15) requesting the Court to reschedule the September 16, 2015, hearing because the defendant was in the hospital at the time of the September 16, 2015, hearing. On September 22, 2015, the undersigned issued an Order and Notice of Hearing (DE # 65, 9/22/15), setting a show cause hearing for October 6, 2015, to determine if the defendant should be held in contempt for failing to comply with this Court's Orders. The defendant appeared at the October 6, 2015 show cause hearing and convinced the Court that he was hospitalized at the time of the September 16, 2015, show cause hearing and the Court decided that sanctions for his failure to appear at that hearing were not appropriate. The undersigned determined that an evidentiary hearing was necessary to decide if the defendant should be held in contempt of Court or sanctioned for failing to comply with this Court's discovery Orders. On October 6, 2015, the undersigned issued an Order (DE # 67, 10/6/15) and set this matter for an evidentiary hearing on October 15, 2015.
The undersigned held an evidentiary hearing in this matter on October 15, 2015, and the defendant presented two witnesses, one of whom was his prior attorney in this matter, Rashad Taylor. The defendant also gave testimony at the October 15, 2015, hearing, and had a composite exhibit of copier machine service records admitted into evidence.
FACTS
The defendant called two witnesses to the stand during the evidentiary hearing. Those witnesses were Rashad Taylor, Esq. and Kevin Lewis. Mr. Taylor was the defendant's former attorney in this matter. The defendant also gave testimony at the evidentiary hearing.
Mr. Taylor testified that to his knowledge, the 2010 tax returns had been copied by the defendant for submission to the government, and that perhaps some of the 2011 tax returns had also been copied to give to the government. Mr. Taylor further testified that neither of the government attorneys with whom he had phone contact ever directly told him that the government did not want hard copies of the requested tax returns. Mr. Taylor testified that after the March 2015 hearing before the undersigned, [*4] he had a discussion with one of the government attorneys on the case and it was decided that electronic production of the tax returns was preferable. It was Mr. Taylor's impression that the government preferred to not receive the tax returns in hard copy. The tax returns were provided to the government in electronic format, but the government was unable to read the electronic medium on which the tax returns were provided. Mr. Lewis testified that he helped move a large number of boxes, and that he helped the defendant dispose of shredded documents.
The defendant testified that he had 12 boxes of documents for the government, and that he disposed of the boxes because the government did not want the volume of paper he wanted to deliver. The defendant also testified that he made so many copies that he had to have his copier serviced. Copies of the service bills reveal the following: (1) the first page is an invoice dated January 19, 2015, from Magnified Imaging Solutions, in the amount of $130.54 for toner for the copy machine; (2) the second page is an invoice dated February 4, 2015, from Magnified Imaging Solutions, in the amount of $331.70 for a service call; and (3) the third page is a work order from Magnified Imaging Solutions dated February 3, 2015, and appears to be a work order related to the February 4, 2015, invoice. It is the defendant's contention that he was prepared to give boxes of photocopied tax returns to the government, but that the government refused to accept the paper copies.
STANDARD OF REVIEW
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37 grants a district court the authority to impose sanctions for the failure to make disclosures or cooperate in discovery. Rule 37 also allows a district court to dismiss an action if a party fails to obey an order to provide or permit discovery. Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(A)(v) . The dismissal of a claim or the entry of a default as a sanction for violating a discovery order is a drastic remedy which should only be employed where lesser sanctions would be insufficient. See Malautea v. Suzuki Motor Co., Ltd., 987 F.2d 1536 , 1542 (11th Cir. 1993) (stating that "the severe sanction of a dismissal or default judgment [under Rule 37 ] is appropriate only as a last resort, when less drastic sanctions would not ensure compliance with the court's orders.") (citing Navarro v. Cohan, 856 F.2d 141 , 142 (11th Cir. 1988)).
ANALYSIS
The plaintiff seeks the following sanctions against Mr. Francois for failing to comply with the Court's discovery Orders: that Mr. Francois' answer to the complaint be STRICKEN and that a DEFAULT be entered against him. As noted above, the dismissal of a claim or the entry of a default as a sanction for violating a discovery order is a drastic remedy which should only be employed where lesser sanctions would be insufficient. See Malautea, 987 F.2d at 1542 (citing Navarro, 856 F.2d at 142 ). In Phipps v. Blakeney, 8 F.3d 788 , 790 (11th Cir.1993), the Eleventh Circuit stated that "[d]ismissal with prejudice is the most severe Rule 37 sanction," but it "may be appropriate when a plaintiff's recalcitrance is due to wilfulness, bad faith or fault."
The defendant claims that he was prepared to give boxes of photocopied tax returns to the government, but that [*5] the government refused to accept the paper copies. The evidence presented at the October 15, 2015, evidentiary hearing demonstrated that the photocopying of tax returns by the defendant, and the servicing of the photocopy machine with respect to the large amount of copying was done prior to the undersigned's Order dated March 12, 2015, (DE # 26). Moreover, Mr. Taylor, the defendant's former attorney in this matter, testified that the government attorneys never directly told him that they would not accept hard copies of the subject tax returns.
There has been no action by the defendant subsequent to the date of the first discovery hearing Order to comply with this Court's three discovery Orders.
RECOMMENDATION
In accordance with the foregoing, the undersigned respectfully persists in his recommendation that the United States' Motion for Sanctions Pursuant to Rule 37(b) (DE # 37, 7/8/15) be GRANTED and that the Court strike defendant LUCVENS FRANCOIS' answer to the complaint and that a default be entered against this defendant as a sanction for failing to comply with this Court's Orders.
The parties have fourteen (14) days from the date of receipt of this Report and Recommendation within which to serve and file written objections, if any, with the Honorable Cecilia M. Altonaga, United States District Court Judge. Failure to file objections timely shall bar the parties from attacking on appeal the factual findings contained herein. See LoConte v. Dugger, 847 F. 2d 745 (11th Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 958 , 109 S. Ct. 397 , 102 L. Ed. 2d 386 (1988); RTC v. Hallmark Builders, Inc., 996 F. 2d 1144 , 1149 (11th Cir. 1993).

WILLIAM MATTHEWMAN 
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION ON DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO STRIKE PLAINTIFFS' NOTICES OF WITHDRAWAL OF DISCOVERY OPT-IN PLAINTIFFS SARA MOTIEY AND AGNES APONTE IDE 4211
THIS CAUSE is before the Court upon Defendants, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, et al.'s ("Defendants") Motion to Strike Plaintiffs' Notices of Withdrawal of Discovery Opt-In Plaintiffs Sara Motiey and Agnes Aponte ("Motion") [DE 421]. This matter was referred to the undersigned by United States District Judge Kenneth A. Marra. See DE 434. Plaintiffs, Fred Devries, et al. ("Plaintiffs") have filed a Response [DE 453], and Defendants have filed a Reply [DE 459]. For the reasons that follow, this Court RECOMMENDS that the District Court GRANT Defendants' Motion.
I. BACKGROUND 
The relevant facts of the case are as follows. Plaintiff Devries filed the Complaint [DE 1] in this action on August 8, 2012 as a collective action pursuant to the Fair Labor Standards Act ("FLSA"). Accordingly, this case is now more than three years old.
In its Second Amended Scheduling Order [DE 144], the Court set the cut-off date for Fact Discovery for December 15, 2014. [DE 144, para. A]. The cut-off date for Representative Discovery was also initially set for December 15, 2014. [DE 144, para. B]. However, the Representative Discovery cut-off date was extended to February 28, 2015 [DE 178], then to April 14, 2015 [DE 215], then to June 12, 2015 [DE 241, para. 1], then to July 23, 2015 for four additional Discovery Opt-Ins [DE 302], and then to August 28, 2015 as to Discovery Opt-In Sara Motiey [DE 400].
The discovery process has been unnecessarily slow, protracted, litigious and expensive. From just January 15, 2015 through the date of this Report and Recommendation, a period of approximately ten months, the Court has held at least thirteen discovery hearings [DE 200, 217, 225, 230, 243, 253, 261, 267, 280, 289, 300, 311, 324], Myriad discovery motions and responses have been filed and numerous orders entered. Fact and Representative Discovery is now closed.
There are now numerous substantive motions pending before the Court. In light of the voluminous substantive motions now pending in this case, the Court recently removed the case from the trial calendar. [DE468].
On August 28, 2015, Plaintiffs filed Plaintiffs' Notice of Withdrawal of Opt-In Plaintiff to withdraw Motiey's Consent to Join in the case. See DE 407. On September 4, 2015, Plaintiffs filed Plaintiffs' Notice of Withdrawal of Opt-In Plaintiff to withdraw Agnes Aponte's Consent to Join in the case.1 See DE 416.
Defendants filed this Motion claiming that the Notices of Withdrawal were improper, unstipulated notices of dismissal "designed to exclude pertinent evidence and continue 'having the Court see only what Plaintiffs want it to see.'" [DE 421, p. 1]. Defendants assert that Motiey recorded, and was paid for, 101 overtime hours of work during her time as [*4] a Financial Advisor Associate ("FAA") and that her employment circumstances are pertinent to key disputed issues in the case. Id. Because significant resources have been spent on ensuring Motiey's participation in discovery, Defendants argue that it would be highly prejudicial and unjust if she were permitted to unilaterally withdraw her consent. [DE 421, p. 2]. As for Aponte, Defendants claim that Plaintiffs' attempt to unilaterally dismiss her from the case is an attempt to exclude yet another Discovery Opt-In Plaintiff who implicates individualized issues precluding class or collective treatment of this case. Id. 
Defendants argue that, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a) , a plaintiff may not unilaterally dismiss their claims without a court order. [DE 421, pp. 8-9]. Therefore, Defendants claim that, as Opt-In Plaintiffs, Motiey and Aponte are considered party plaintiffs and can only dismiss their claims by filing a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties who have appeared. [DE 421, p. 9], Accordingly, Defendants ask that the Court strike the Notices of Withdrawal, reaffirm that Motiey must appear for her deposition and respond to discovery requests, and order monetary and other sanctions against Motiey if she fails to cooperate. [DE 421, pp. 9-10]. Defendants also request that if Motiey is dismissed, Defendants should be granted leave to take her deposition as a third party because she has information relevant to the issues in this case. [DE 421, p. 11].
In response, Plaintiffs assert that the Court previously instructed how Discovery Opt-In Plaintiffs were to be selected and replaced in this matter. [DE 453, p. 2]. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants only take issue with the withdrawal and replacement process now because they "needed a vehicle to file additional pages in opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion for Final FLSA and Class Certification." [DE 453, p. 3]. Plaintiffs also claim that Defendants have been aware that Motiey would be non-responsive since at least June 30, 2015. [DE 453, p. 5]. Plaintiffs argue that Motiey would likely have been dismissed from the case by the Court anyways, like the other twenty-six non-responsive Discovery Opt-Ins, for failing to participate in discovery. Id. Next, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants fail to identify any basis to force Aponte to continue to be a part of this case. Plaintiffs assert that Aponte has requested to withdraw from this case and that Defendants already have Aponte's deposition to use as they wish. [DE 453, p. 6]. Finally, Plaintiffs assert that prior to Motiey and Aponte's Notices of Withdrawal, two Opt-Ins and four Discovery Opt-Ins voluntarily withdrew from the case by filing Notices of Withdrawal without argument from Defendants. [DE 453, p. 7]. Plaintiffs state that this procedure was established in the Court's Second Amended Scheduling Order, which said "[a] discovery opt-in who fails or refuses to participate in discovery or deposition will be replaced by the same process by which they were selected." Id. 
In their reply, Defendants contend that Plaintiffs admit in their Response that the Notices of Withdrawal [*5] were unilateral and not stipulated. [DE 457, p. 1 ]. Defendants assert that Rule 41 (a) and the case law are clear that opt-in plaintiffs cannot unilaterally dismiss their claims by filing notices of withdrawal. [DE 459, p. 2]. According to Defendants, the cases cited by Plaintiffs in their Response involved either defendants who agreed that the opt-ins could be dismissed—or showed no indication that they objected to the dismissal—or opt-in plaintiffs who sought leave of court before dismissing their claims. [DE 459, p. 3]. Next, Defendants claim that regardless of how the parties handled previous non-responsive Discovery Opt-ins, that process is inapplicable now because discovery is closed. [DE 459, p. 5]. Moreover, Defendants point out that Motiey was specifically court-ordered to respond to discovery and attend her deposition, which she failed to do. Id. Unlike previously dismissed Discovery Opt-ins, Defendants did not agree to dismiss Motiey or Aponte. Id. Also, Defendants emphasize that Aponte is not a non-responsive Discovery Opt-In because she responded to discovery and attended her deposition, therefore the process for non-responsive Discovery Opt-Ins is irrelevant to her. [DE 459, p. 6].
II. DISCUSSION 
The Court has reviewed Defendants' Motion [DE 421], Plaintiffs' Response [DE 453], and Defendants' Reply [DE 459]. The Court finds that the Defendants' Motion to Strike should be granted for the following reasons.
First, there is no clear authority that allows Plaintiffs to unilaterally withdraw Discovery Opt-in Plaintiffs Motiey and Aponte from this case without Defendants' consent or Court approval. Conversely, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a) is clear to the effect that, after an answer has been filed, plaintiffs may only dismiss their claims by stipulation or court order. Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1)(A) ; Reyes v. Texas EZPAWN, L.P., Case No. V-03-128, [2006 BL 122419], 2006 WL 3513936 , *1 (S.D. Tex. Dec. 6, 2006) ("Contrary to Plaintiffs belief, simply withdrawing the consent forms of opt-in plaintiffs does not automatically dismiss their claims without an order of this Court."). The Eleventh Circuit has held that "by referring to them as 'party plaintiff[s]' Congress indicated that opt-in plaintiffs should have the same status in relation to the claims of the lawsuit as do the named plaintiffs." Prickett v. DeKalb Cnty., 349 F.3d 1294 , 1297 (11th Cir. 2003). Thus, opt-in plaintiffs are party plaintiffs and are required to comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41 to withdraw from a case.
Here, Plaintiffs' counsel contacted Defendants' counsel on August 26, 2015, and asked if Defendants would join in a stipulated order dismissing Motiey from the case because she wanted to be withdrawn from the matter. [DE 421-2, Ex. B]. This was an implicit admission by Plaintiffs' counsel that the consent of Defendants' counsel was required to effectuate a dismissal of Motiey. Defendants' counsel did not agree to the stipulated order. Id. Plaintiffs did not file a motion seeking a court order dismissing Motiey. Because Plaintiffs had neither the consent of the Defendants nor the approval of the Court, their two Notices of Withdrawal of Motiey and Aponte are without legal support and should be stricken. See Butler v. DirectSat USA, [*6] LLC, 800 F.Supp.2d 662 , 666 (D. Md. 2011) (the court agreed that an opt-in plaintiff could not withdraw without court approval or a joint stipulation because an answer had already been filed in the case). Plaintiffs cannot simply unilaterally decide that Discovery Opt-Ins Motiey and Aponte are "not members of the collective" [see DE 453, p. 10, n. 10] by the filing of an unauthorized Notice of Withdrawal. Because Defendants do not stipulate to withdrawal of Motiey and Aponte, and because this Court did not authorize such dismissal, both Discovery Opt-Ins should remain in the case at this time.
Second, the Court rejects Plaintiffs' argument that, at this late date, after discovery has closed, the Defendants should be forced to select two new Discovery Opt-In Plaintiffs and incur the additional, significant expense of compiling and producing additional electronic discovery as to the two new Opt-Ins and proceeding with written discovery and depositions as to two new Opt-Ins. Plaintiffs make the argument that this is how the case has progressed to date and that the situation involving Motiey and Aponte is no different from prior Opt-Ins who were removed from the case and replaced. [DE 453, pp. 7-8]. However, Plaintiffs ignore the fact that discovery is now closed. Additionally, Plaintiffs ignore the fact that Defendants consented, either expressly or impliedly, to replacement of prior Discovery Opt-Ins and do not consent to replacement of Motiey and Aponte. Plaintiffs also ignore that Motiey was previously ordered by this Court to attend her deposition and respond to discovery [DE 400] and that she has failed to comply.
Third, the Court is concerned that Plaintiffs' attempts to withdraw Discovery Opt-Ins Motiey and Aponte may be designed, at least in part, to prevent the Court from considering the testimony of those two Opt-Ins in regards to the pending substantive motions. The Court is troubled by Plaintiffs' statement that "they do not dispute" that Defendants can use Aponte's testimony (and therefore Aponte should not be forced to litigate her claim against her wishes) [DE 453, p. 6], in light of Plaintiffs' argument contained in the final footnote of Plaintiffs' Response, which states in part as follows: "More importantly, it should be noted that on a motion for decertification, the Court should not be concerned with the experience of Opt-ins who are not members of the collective.. .Accordingly, because neither Motiey nor Aponte are members of the collective, discovery as to them is not relevant and not probative of whether the collective is similarly situated. Notwithstanding this, and as stated above, Plaintiffs agree that Aponte's deposition testimony is already part of the record and may be cited by the parties." [DE 453, p. 10, n. 10]. This seems to be a disingenuous argument by Plaintiffs, which in effect suggests that once Discovery Opt-ins Motiey and Aponte are unilaterally withdrawn from the case, they or their "experience" are not to be considered by the Court regarding the pending substantive motions, but the Defendants can meaninglessly cite to the testimony [*7] or experience of those two Discovery Opt-ins.
The Court rejects Plaintiffs' position in this regard. Plaintiffs cannot unilaterally withdraw Discovery Opt-ins Motiey and Aponte from this case, over Defendants' objection and without court approval, in violation of Rule 41(a) , and then profit from such unauthorized action by arguing that because of the withdrawals, Motiey and Aponte are no longer members of the collective action and their "experience," testimony, or evidence is no longer relevant or probative as to whether the collective is similarly situated. Whether or not the testimony, evidence, or experience of either Motiey or Aponte is relevant to the pending motions or other issues in this case is for the Court to decide at an appropriate time. Plaintiffs cannot unilaterally dictate what evidence is, or is not, relevant and probative in this case.
Accordingly, as to Motiey, Plaintiffs' Notice of Withdrawal [DE 407] should be stricken. Further, the Court's prior Order [DE 400] dated August 13, 2015 ordered Motiey to respond to written discovery requests and attend her deposition by August 28,2015. That Order also advised Motiey that if she failed to comply with the Order, her claim may be dismissed with prejudice and additional sanctions imposed against her. Motiey should be ordered once again to sit for her deposition and answer interrogatories within a reasonable period of time to be set by the Court. If Motiey fails or refuses to do so, the case against her should be dismissed with prejudice. Further, in the event of such noncompliance, because a dismissal with prejudice of Motiey would not completely remedy the prejudice suffered by Defendants due to her noncompliance and withholding of potential favorable testimony, Defendants should also be entitled to (1) an inference that Motiey's testimony would have been favorable to Defendants; (2) a finding that she recorded and was paid for 101 hours of overtime work as argued by Defendants; (3) admission of documents establishing that she recorded and was paid for 101 hours of overtime work as argued by Defendants; and (4) additional sanctions as may be deemed appropriate by the Court.
As to Aponte, Plaintiffs' Notice of Withdrawal [DE 416] should be stricken. Aponte is not a Discovery Opt-In who refused to respond to discovery. She responded to written discovery and testified at her deposition. Therefore, her situation is somewhat different from that of Motiey. Simply because Aponte has made a request to be withdrawn from this case at this late date, after she has sat for her deposition and provided testimony and evidence, does not mean that she must be allowed to withdraw. The Court finds that Defendants would be prejudiced if Aponte was permitted to withdraw as they would then face an argument from Plaintiffs that her testimony and evidence is irrelevant because she would arguably no longer be a member of the collective. Defendants would also be prejudiced in having to go through the expensive and lengthy process of replacing her and engaging in discovery [*8] as to a new Opt-In. Defendants argue that Aponte's testimony at her deposition was untruthful and helpful to Defendants' position in this lawsuit. The Court does not need to make any credibility determination as to Aponte's testimony for purposes of this Motion. Because Aponte should remain in this case as a Discovery Opt-In Plaintiff, the parties should be permitted to make use of her testimony in any appropriate manner and in regards to any pending motion or at trial.
III. CONCLUSION 
In light of the foregoing, this Court RECOMMENDS that the District Court GRANT Defendant's Motion to Strike Plaintiffs' Notices of Withdrawal of Discovery Opt-In Plaintiffs Sara Motiey and Agnes Aponte [DE 421]. The Court also RECOMMENDS that the District Court STRIKE Plaintiffs' Notice of Withdrawal of Opt-In Plaintiff [DE 407] for Sara Motiey and Plaintiffs Notice of Withdrawal of Opt-In Plaintiff [DE 416] for Agnes Aponte. The Court further RECOMMENDS that Discovery Opt-In Sara Motiey be ordered to attend her deposition and respond to discovery requests within a reasonable time as set by the Court. Moreover, if Sara Motiey refuses to attend her deposition and/or respond to discovery requests, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that the Court dismiss her case with prejudice and further, that Defendants should be entitled to (1) an inference that Motiey's testimony would have been favorable to Defendants; (2) a finding that she recorded and was paid for 101 hours of overtime work as argued by Defendants; (3) admission of documents establishing that she recorded and was paid for 101 hours of overtime work as argued by Defendants; and (4) any additional sanctions as deemed appropriate by the Court.

November 5, 2015, Filed November 5, 2015, Decided 
For United States of America, Plaintiff: Christopher Robert Moran, Richard Gerald Rose, LEAD ATTORNEYS, U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, DC; Jose A. Olivera, U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Trial Section, Central Region, Washington, DC.

CECILIA M. ALTONAGA, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE.

CECILIA M. ALTONAGA 
ORDER
On July 8, 2015, Plaintiff, United States of America ("Plaintiff" or "the Government") filed a Motion for Sanctions Pursuant to Rule 37(b) ("Motion") [ECF No. 37]. The Court referred the Motion to Magistrate Judge John J. O'Sullivan for a report and recommendation. (See Order [ECF No. 42]). On September 16, 2015, Judge O'Sullivan entered a Report and Recommendation ("First Report") [ECF No. 63]. In the Report, Judge O'Sullivan recommended the Court grant the Motion; strike Defendant, Lucvens Francois's ("Francois['s]") Answer to the Complaint; and enter a default against Francois. (See  id. 5). Judge O'Sullivan found these sanctions warranted due to Francois's failure to comply with five of the Court's Orders and failure to appear at two duly noticed hearings. (See  id. 4).
On September 21, 2015, Francois filed a Motion ("Defendant's Motion") [ECF No. 64], asking Judge O'Sullivan to reschedule one of the duly noticed hearings, and advising he had been unable to attend due to medical reasons. (See  id. 1). Magistrate Judge O'Sullivan construed Defendant's Motion as a request to reconsider the First Report and set the matter for a show cause hearing on October 6, 2015, allowing Francois the opportunity to discuss why sanctions should not be imposed. (See Order . . . [ECF No. 65] 1-2). Francois appeared at the October 6, 2015 hearing, following which Judge O'Sullivan set an evidentiary hearing for October 15, 2015, allowing Francois the opportunity to present witnesses and show cause why sanctions should not be imposed. (See Order . . . [ECF No. 67] 1-2).
Following the October 15, 2015 evidentiary hearing, Judge O'Sullivan entered a new Report and Recommendation ("Second Report") [ECF No. 70] on October 16, 2015. In the Second Report, Judge O'Sullivan persists in his original recommendation the Court grant the Motion; strike Francois's Answer to the Complaint; and enter a default against Francois. (See  id. 1). On October 30, 2015, Francois filed an Objection . . . ("Objections") [ECF No. 71]. When a magistrate judge's "disposition" has properly been objected to, district courts must review the disposition de novo. Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(3) .
I. BACKGROUND 
On March 12, 2015, Judge O'Sullivan issued an Order ("First Discovery Order") [ECF No. 26] requiring Francois to provide certain discovery responses to the Government, including copies of tax returns. (See Second Report 2). On April 21, 2015, Judge O'Sullivan issued another Order ("Second Discovery Order") [ECF No. 29] requiring Francois [*2] to provide electronic discovery of tax returns to the Government. (See Second Report 2). Further, on May 26, 2015, Judge O'Sullivan issued a third Order ("Third Discovery Order") [ECF No. 32], requiring Francois to either provide the Government with certain discovery responses, including tax returns, or submit a memorandum of law as to the applicability of the Fifth Amendment privilege to the case. (See Second Report 2). No memorandum of law was submitted. (See id.).
On July 8, 2015, Plaintiff filed the instant Motion seeking sanctions against Francois for his failure to comply with the aforementioned three discovery Orders. (See id.). Francois did not respond to the Motion, and on August 11, 2015, Judge O'Sullivan issued an Order and Notice of Hearing ("First Order and Notice of Hearing") [ECF No. 55] requiring Francois to file a written response, warning "[t]he failure to file a response may result in an Order that United States' Motion for Sanctions Pursuant to Rule 37(b) (DE # 37, 7/8/15) be granted in its entirety;" and setting the sanctions motion for a hearing on September 1, 2015. (Second Report 2 (quoting First Order and Notice of Hearing 1)).
Francois failed to respond to the Motion and did not appear at the September 1, 2015 hearing. (See id.). Following the September 1, 2015 hearing, Judge O'Sullivan issued another Order and Notice of Hearing ("Second Order and Notice of Hearing") [ECF No. 60], requiring Francois to provide certain discovery documents to Plaintiff by September 8, 2015; file a memorandum with the Court addressing why he should not be held in contempt for failure to comply with the Court's Orders; and appear at a show cause hearing on September 16, 2015 to discuss his failure to comply. (See Second Report 2-3). The Second Order and Notice of Hearing warned Francois that failure to appear at the hearing could result in a recommendation that he be held in contempt and sanctions be imposed. (See  id. 3).
On September 8, 2015, Francois filed a Constructive Notice of Conditional Acceptance ("Notice") [ECF No. 61], explaining he failed to appear at the September 1, 2015 hearing because the Court failed to properly notify him of the hearing. (See Second Report 3). Judge O'Sullivan notes the Court's CM/ECF system indicates the First Order and Notice of Hearing was mailed to Francois's address of record. (See id.). Further, Francois's Notice indicates he received the Second Order and Notice of Hearing requiring him to appear at the September 16, 2015 hearing. (See  id. 4).
Nonetheless, as stated, Francois failed to appear at the September 16, 2015 hearing. (See id.). Consequently, Judge O'Sullivan issued the First Report, recommending the Court grant the Motion and impose sanctions against Francois. (See id.). As noted, when Francois moved Judge O'Sullivan to reconsider his First Report, Judge O'Sullivan set a show cause hearing for October 6, 2015. (See id.). At the October 6, 2015 hearing, Francois appeared and convinced Judge O'Sullivan he had been hospitalized at the time of the September 16, 2015 hearing. (See id.). The Magistrate Judge thus decided against imposing sanctions for Francois's failure to appear [*3] at that hearing, and set an evidentiary hearing for October 15, 2015 to determine if Francois should be held in contempt or sanctioned for failing to comply with the Court's discovery Orders. (See  id. 4-5).
At the evidentiary hearing of October 15, 2015, Francois presented two witnesses, Rashad Taylor, Esq. ("Taylor") and Kevin Lewis ("Lewis"). (See  id. 5). Taylor is Francois's former attorney in this matter. (See id.). Taylor testified that, to his knowledge, Francois had copied the 2010 tax returns, and possibly some of the 2011 tax returns, to submit to Plaintiff. (See id.). He further testified that after a March 2015 hearing before Judge O'Sullivan, Taylor and one of the Government attorneys decided electronic production of the tax returns was preferable, although neither of the Government attorneys directly told him the Government did not want hard copies of the requested tax returns. (See id.). Taylor was under the impression the Government preferred not to receive the tax returns in hard copy. (See id.). Thus, the tax returns were provided to the Government in electronic format; however, the Government was unable to read the electronic medium on which the returns were provided. (See id.).
Presumably after providing the tax returns in electronic format to the Government, Francois disposed of the hard copies. (See  id. 6). Lewis testified he helped Francois dispose of the shredded documents. (See  id. 5-6). Francois testified he disposed of the documents because the Government did not want the volume of paper he wanted to deliver. (See  id. 6). Francois also testified he made so many copies he had to have his copier serviced. (See id.). Copies of Francois's service bills include: (1) an invoice dated January 19, 2015 for copy machine toner; (2) an invoice dated February 4, 2015 for a service call; and (3) a work order dated February 3, 2015 related to the February 4, 2015 invoice. (See id.).
II. ANALYSIS 
In his Second Report, Judge O'Sullivan finds Francois's evidence presented at the October 15, 2015 evidentiary hearing fails to persuade sanctions are inappropriate. (See  id. 7). Predominantly, Francois's evidence demonstrated he copied the tax returns and had the copier serviced before Judge O'Sullivan entered any of the discovery Orders at issue.1 (See id.). That is, Francois took no action subsequent to the date of the First Discovery Order to comply with the Court's three discovery Orders. (See id.). Moreover, Taylor testified the Government attorneys never directly told him they would not accept hard copies of the tax returns. (See id.). Consequently, Judge O'Sullivan persists in his original recommendation the sanctions sought by Plaintiff are warranted. (See id.).
Francois's Objections to Judge O'Sullivan's Second Report are brief and cursory. (See generally Objections). First, Francois simply states Taylor testified at the evidentiary hearing the Government "implied" it did not want hard copies of the tax returns, at which point Francois destroyed the copies and mailed an external hard drive with electronic copies to the Government. (See  id. 1). Second, Francois states he followed the "exact instructions" [*4] Taylor and/or Plaintiff gave him. ( Id.). Neither of these objections addresses or explains the fact Francois took no action subsequent to the date of the First Discovery Order to comply with the Court's three Orders. It is this fact that forms the crux of Judge O'Sullivan's conclusion sanctions are warranted.
Finally, Francois concludes his Objections by attempting to move to dismiss this case, stating "[I] move the court to dismiss all charges since all the concerns of the United States are being addressed in the criminal case." ( Id. (alteration added)). This addition to Francois's Objections does not constitute a proper motion to dismiss. The Local Rules require a motion to dismiss to "incorporate a memorandum of law citing supporting authorities," which Francois has failed to include. S.D. FLA. L.R. 7.1(a)(1) . Consequently, all three of Francois's objections are without merit.
III. CONCLUSION 
The undersigned has conducted a de novo review of the record, the parties' filings, and the Second Report with respect to Francois's Objections, and has otherwise reviewed the Second Report to assure herself there is no clear error. In the light of that review, the undersigned agrees with the analysis and recommendations stated in Judge O'Sullivan's Second Report, and adopts Judge O'Sullivan's conclusion the Motion should be granted, and Francois's Answer stricken as a sanction pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(b) .
Regarding entering default against Francois, Plaintiff is required to file a motion for default final judgment, as required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 55(b) , because Plaintiff seeks injunctive relief, instead of damages in the form of "a sum certain or a sum that can be made certain by computation." Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(b) ; see also United States v. Sellers, No. 5:11-CV-326-RS-CJK, [2013 BL 397299], 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 76730 , 2013 WL 3746102 , at *3 (N.D. Fla. Apr. 30, 2013)report and recommendation approved, No. 5:11-CV-326-RS-CJK, [2013 BL 143693], 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 76747 , 2013 WL 2403671 (N.D. Fla. May 31, 2013) (noting a court may issue default judgment where a party fails to obey a discovery order in a civil case; however, where the plaintiff's claim against defendant is not for a sum certain or for a sum that can be made certain by computation, "the party must apply to the court for a default judgment" (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(b) )). Plaintiff's Motion cannot be construed as a motion for default judgment because, while it requests the Court enter default judgment as a sanction, it focuses solely on the sanctions standard of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(b) , rather than addressing Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 55 ; and does not comply with the requirements for a motion for default judgment contained in the Local Rules. See generally Mot; see also S.D. FLA. L.R. 7.1 (a)(2) .
Accordingly, it is
ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the First Report [ECF No. 63] and the Second Report [ECF No. 70] are AFFIRMED AND ADOPTED as follows:
1. The United States of America's Motion [ECF No. 37] is GRANTED.
2. Lucven Francois's Answer [ECF No. 15] is STRICKEN.
3. Plaintiff, United States of America shall file a motion for default final judgment by November 16, 2015.
a. The motion for default final judgment shall be accompanied by a proposed order and proposed final judgment. (See Local Rule 7.1(a)(2) .). Pursuant to the CM/ECF Administrative Procedures, the proposed orders shall be submitted [*5] to the Court by e-mail in Word format at altonaga@flsd.uscourts.gov . Plaintiff shall send a copy of the motion to Defendant's counsel, or to Defendant if he does not have counsel. In the certificate of service, Plaintiff shall indicate that notice was sent and the addresses where notice was sent.
b. If Defendant fails to respond to the motion for default final judgment within the time permitted by the Rules, default final judgment may be entered, which, simply put, means that Plaintiff may be able to obtain relief against Defendant.

DONE AND ORDERED in Miami, Florida, this 5th day of November, 2015.

WILLIAM C. TURNOFF 
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
THIS CAUSE came before the Court upon Defendants' Motion for Attorney's Fees Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 285 (ECFNo. 166), and Defendants' Bill of Costs(ECFNo. 160). These matters were referred to the undersigned by the Honorable Darrin P. Gayles, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Florida. (ECF No. 162). A hearing on [*2] these matters was held on August 18, 2015. (ECF No. 178). The Court has reviewed the written and oral arguments, the record, the applicable law, and is otherwise duly advised in the premises.
Background 
This patent infringement action involving Voice over Internet Protocol ("VoIP") technology, was filed by Plaintiff Net Talk.com, Inc., against Defendants MagicJack Vocaltec Ltd., Magicjack LP, Magicjack Holdings Corporation, and Daniel Borislow (collectively, "Defendants"), on September 21, 2012, pursuant to the Patent Act, 35 U.S.C. §§ 101 , et seq. (ECFNo. 1). The original Complaint alleged that, inter alia, Defendants infringed on U.S. Patent No. 8,243,722 ("the '722 B2 Patent "), which related to a VoIP communications system containing an analog telephone adapter ("ATA"), with two or more Internet access points, allowing "landline" phones to make calls over the Internet.
On December 17, 2012, the Court stayed the case pending the outcome of an ex parte re-examination of the '722 B2 Patent 's claims by the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO") at Defendants' request.1 (ECF No. 33, 36). Upon re-examination, the USPTO rejected the '722 B2 Patent 's claims. (ECF No. 37). During re-examination, Plaintiff amended its patent claims to require not only "multiple separate and independent internet access connections," but also an "internet connection provided by the ATA." The USPTO allowed the Patent to re-issue as amended. (ECF No. 41). On February 27, 2014, the USPTO issued the re-examination certificate (ECF No. 46), with the reissued Patent now listed as U.S. Patent No. 8,243,722 C1 ("the '722 C1 Patent ").
The case was reopened on February 5, 2014. (ECF No. 44). Plaintiff filed an amended Complaint on March 20, 2014, alleging that, inter alia, Defendants had infringed on the '722 C1 Patent by designing, making, or causing to be made, offering to sell, and selling products that embody and/or practice at least one of the claims of the '722 C1 Patent , and that have no substantial non-infringing use. (ECF No. 48).
Defendant Borislow moved to dismiss the claims brought against him individually for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. (ECF No. 52). The Court partially granted the motion dismissing the claims for direct and contributory infringement, but allowing the claims for induced infringement to remain. (ECF No. 68). Mr. Borislow passed away on July 21, 2014. (ECF No. 120).
On June 24, 2014, and July 8, 2014, respectively, the parties submitted briefs regarding claim construction setting forth disputed terms and language in the '722 C1 Patent and asking the Court to construe those terms. (ECF Nos. 67, 71). The Court held a Markman hearing on August 29, 2015. (ECF No. 67, 86, 98).
On October 22, 2014, Plaintiff moved for a 90-day stay pending establishment and representation of Mr. Borislow's estate. (ECF No. 102). OnNovember 25, 2014, Plaintiff's counsel moved to withdraw. (ECF No. 126).
On December 1, 2014, Judge Gayles entered an Order on Claims Construction. (ECF No. 129). On December 12, 2014, the Court granted a stay until December 31, 2014, pending appearance of new counsel for Plaintiff. (ECF Nos. 139, 140). New counsel was substituted for Plaintiff [*3] on January 1, 2015. (ECF No. 141).
On February 26, 2015, Plaintiff moved to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction based upon a covenant not to sue. (ECF No. 154). The motion was granted on February 27, 2015. (ECF No. 158). A final judgment was entered on June 18, 2015. (ECF No. 172).The Court subsequently dismissed Plaintiff's claims with prejudice and Defendants' claims without prejudice, and reserved jurisdiction to determine attorney's fees and costs. Id. Defendants have moved for attorney's fees in accordance with 35 U.S.C. §285 . (ECF No. 166).
Legal Standard 
The Patent Act provides that "[t]he court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party." 35 U.S.C. §285 . Defendants argued that this case was exceptional, thus warranting a fee award. Given the recent changes in this area of the law, the following serves as the framework for the undersigned's analysis.
Until recently, the Federal Circuit adhered to the standard set forth in Brooks Furniture Mfg., Inc. v. Dutailier Int'l, Inc., 393 F.3d 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2005), wherein a case was deemed "exceptional" if there had been some "material inappropriate conduct," or if the action had been both "objectively baseless" and "brought in subjective bad faith."  Id. at 1381 . Although the decision to award fees remained within the Court's discretion, it required the existence of both elements by clear and convincing evidence. Id . 
In Octane Fitness, LLC v. ICON Health & Fitness, Inc., 134 S.Ct. 1749 , 188 L. Ed. 2d 816 (2014), the Supreme Court rejected the Brooks standard finding that this framework was unduly rigid and impermissibly encumbered the statutory grant of discretion to district courts.  Id. at 1755-56 . The Octane Fitness Court further found that this standard would render §285 "largely superfluous," because courts already had the inherent power to award fees for cases involving misconduct or bad faith.  Id. at 1758 . Moreover, the Supreme Court moved away from a standard of clear and convincing evidence to establish entitlement to fees. Id . Instead, the Court reasoned that patent-infringement litigation has always been governed by a preponderance of the evidence standard, because it allowed both parties to "share the risk of error in roughly equal fashion." Id . (citing Herman & MacLean v. Huddleston, 459 U.S. 375 , 390 , 103 S. Ct. 683 , 74 L. Ed. 2d 548 (1983)).
In construing §285 , the Octane Fitness Court held that, since the Patent Act does not define it, "exceptional" should be defined in accordance with its ordinary meaning. Id . Thus, an exceptional case is "simply one that stands out from others with respect to the substantive strength of a party's litigating position (considering both the governing law and the facts of the case) or the unreasonable manner in which the case was litigated." Id . However, "[t]here is no precise rule or formula" guiding the determination of whether a case is exceptional.  Id. at 1755-56 (citing Fogerty v. Fantasy. Inc., 510 U.S. 517 , 114 S.Ct. 1023 , 127 L.Ed.2d 455 (1994)). Courts must engage in a "case-by-case exercise of their discretion, considering the totality of the circumstances."  Id. at 1755-56 (citing Fogerty, 510 U.S. 517 , 114 S. Ct. 1023 , 127 L. Ed. 2d 455 ). Factors relevant to the inquiry include: "frivolousness, motivation, objective unreasonableness (both in the factual and [*4] legal components of the case) and the need in particular circumstances to advance considerations of compensation and deterrence." Octane Fitness, 134 S. Ct. at 1756 , n. 6 (quoting Fogerty, 510 U.S. at 534 , n. 19)).
As with any new ruling, courts are engaged in the initial stages of interpretation. Thus far, however, courts have been reluctant to award fees where a plaintiff has, "set forth some good faith argument in favor of its position." Small v. Implant Direct Mfg., LLC, No. 06-CIV-683 (NRB), [2014 BL 309275], 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 154468 , 2014 WL 5463621 , at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 23, 2014): see also EON Corp. IP Holdings LLC v. Cisco Sys., 12-CV-01011-JST, [2014 BL 206369], 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 101923 , 2014 WL 3726170 (N.D. Cal. Jul. 25, 2014) (denying an award of attorney's fees where infringement contentions lacked merit, but the Court could not conclude that "no reasonable patentee could [find] an opening . . . through which the argument [albeit stretched] could be squeezed").
Courts have noted that, although the post-Octane Fitness fee inquiry is guided by a more lenient standard, an attorney's fee award is still the exception to the American Rule and should be reserved only for rare circumstances. BMW of N. Am., LLC v. Cuhadar, No. 6.T4-CV-40-ORL-37DAB, [2014 BL 405605], 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 112365 , 2014 WL 5420133 , at *3 (M.D. Fla. July 10, 2014) (citing Intellect Wireless, Inc. v. Sharp Corp., 45 F. Supp. 3d 839 , 2014 WL 2443871 , *5 (N.D. Ill. 2014)); see High Tech Pet Prods. v. Shenzhen Jianfeng Elec. Pet Prod. Co., Ltd., No. 6:14-cv-759-Orl-22TBS, [2015 BL 58415], 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26314 , 2015 WL 926023 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 4, 2015) (citing Intellect Wireless, Inc., 45 F. Supp. 3d 839 , 2014 WL 2443871 , at *5).
Thus, the question before the Court is whether this case is "exceptional," such that Defendants, as the prevailing party in this suit, are entitled to an award of attorney's fees pursuant to § 285 .
In this regard, the Court notes that, even if it were to determine that this case was exceptional, Defendants would not be automatically entitled to an award of attorney's fees. See Icon Health & Fitness, Inc. v. Octane Fitness, LLC, 576 F. App'x 1002 , 1005 (Fed. Cir. 2014) ("The Supreme Court's decision in Octane did not, however, revoke the discretion of a district court to deny fee awards even in exceptional cases"). A determination as to the propriety of a fee award is a separate discretionary inquiry. See 35 U.S.C. § 285 ("The court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party" (emphasis addedY);RCI TM Corp. v. R & R Venture Group, LLC, No. 6:13-cv-945-Orl-22, [2015 BL 40428], 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18762 , 2015 WL 668715 , at * 11 (M.D. Fla. Feb. 17, 2015) ("Even if the trial court finds that the circumstances of the case are, in fact, exceptional, the decision whether to award attorney's fees is still discretionary"); Dieter v. B & H Industries of Southwest Florida Inc., 880 F.2d 322 , 329 (11th Cir. 1989) (citing Jellibeans, Inc. v. Skating Clubs of Georgia. Inc., 716 F.2d 833 , 846 (11th Cir. 1983) ("Even if the trial court finds that the circumstances of the case are, in fact, exceptional, the decision whether to award attorney's fees is still discretionary")). "In determining whether to award attorney's fees, courts consider the closeness of the case, the tactics of counsel, the conduct of the parties, and any other factors that may contribute to a fair allocation of the burdens of litigation as between winner and loser." See H-W Technology, Inc. v. Overstock.com, Inc., No. 3:12-CV-0636-G (BH), [2014 BL 412484], 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 122667 , 2014 WL 4378750 , at * (N.D. Tex. Sept. 3, 2014).
Against this backdrop, the undersigned makes the following findings and recommendations.
Discussion 
Defendants argued that [*5] this case was deserving of an exceptionality designation under § 285 , because Plaintiff pursued baseless claims of infringement and damages and litigated the case in an unreasonable manner. (ECF No. 166).
I. Plaintiff's Infringement Claims.
As noted supra, during re-examination, Plaintiff amended its patent claims to require "multiple separate and independent internet access connections," as well as an "internet connection provided by the ATA." Both of these amendments were the basis of Defendants' non-infringement arguments. One was subject to claim construction, while the other was not. Plaintiff focused its argument on the validity of the position dependent upon claim construction.
A. Patent Claim Subject to Claim Construction.
The phrase, "multiple, separate and independent internet access connections," was the subject of claim construction. Defendants argued that this claim became objectively baseless as of December 1, 2014, when the Court issued its Claim Construction Order.
According to Defendants, the most fair reading of this claim was that the multiple, independent access points had to be inside the housing of the ATA. In reaching this conclusion, Defendants relied upon the sworn affidavit of Plaintiff's expert, Dr. Costas Papadopoulos, who stated that Plaintiff's patent claims were different from prior art2 because the claims required "multiple, separate and independent internet connections to be in the housing of the ATA."
Contrary to Defendants' position, Plaintiff argued that the term referred to direct or indirect connections that were not limited to multiple, separate and independent internet access points in the housing of the ATA. According to Plaintiff, based upon the intrinsic record,3 which was the drawings and the written matter or the specifications of the patent, as well as the prosecution history, there could be an indirect or direct connection, but there was no limitation on the face of the claims, and there was no support in the specification to read an inner limitation, that these access points be within, or inside, the housing of the ATA.
Moreover, Plaintiff rebutted Defendants' reliance on the Papadopoulus Affidavit arguing that Defendants were reading it too narrowly and out of context. To illustrate the ambiguity of Dr. Papadopoulus' statement in this regard, Plaintiff included an excerpt of the transcript from the Markman hearing wherein Judge Gayles questioned Defendants' interpretation of the affidavit. (ECF No. 167) at p. 155:5-22; 158:1-16; 159:22; 160:7. Judge Gayles noted that when Mr. Papadopolous made his statements about the internet connections being in the housing of the ATA, he was referring to another device of prior art. Id. 
Defendants also relied upon the testimony of Plaintiff's Chief Technical Officer, Garry Paxinos. According to Defendants, Mr. Paxinos had defined "multiple separate and independent internet access connections" in a sworn statement before the USPTO in a way that precluded infringement. This argument was premised on Defendants' "in the housing" [*6] construction of the same claim term. Plaintiff argued that, because the Court did not construe this claim term as requiring "multiple separate and independent internet access points in the housing of the ATA" until its December 2014 Claim Construction Order, then Defendants could not demonstrate that Plaintiff's proposed construction, or related infringement contention, were objectively baseless or made in bad faith.
Plaintiff argued further that it had a good faith infringement claim that would have gone to trial even if, ultimately, it was unsuccessful. Moreover, Plaintiff argued that Defendants were attempting to elevate the fee request to the level of summary judgment on non-infringement.
The issue is whether Plaintiff's position was tenable and made in good faith, not whether it was ultimately successful. See SFA Sys., LLC v. Newegg Inc., 793 F.3d 1344 , 1347-48 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (what matters is "substantive strength," "not the correctness or eventual success of that position" (emphasis in original)). The Court agrees that "for a case dismissed before trial to be designated exceptional, evidence of the frivolity of the claims must be reasonably clear without requiring a "mini-trial" on the merits for attorneys' fees purposes." Charge Lion LLC v. Linear Tech. Corn., No. 6:12-CV-00769, [2014 BL 454758], 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 184576 (E.D. Tex. Aug. 25, 2014); SFA Sys., LLC v. 1-800-Flowers .com, Inc., No. 6:11CV399, [2014 BL 453550],  2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 184311 (E.D. Tex. July 7, 2014), at * 4-5, aff'd sub nom; SFA Sys., LLC v. Newegg Inc., 793 F.3d at 1348-49 ; Trover Group, Inc. v. Dedicated Micros USA, 2:13-CV-1047-WCB, [2015 BL 263785], 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107733 , 2015 WL 4910875 , at * 3 (E.D. Tex. 2015).
B. Patent Claim Not Subject to Claim Construction.
The asserted claim's requirement for an "internet connection provided by the ATA" was not the subject of claim construction. Mr. Paxinos had tested the device in 2012 and confirmed that it was a sound card, which meant that it did not have an "internet connection provided by the ATA." Defendants argued that, because Plaintiff had already analyzed the accused product when it added that limitation to the asserted claim during re-examination, it knew or should have known, without having to wait for the Court to issue the Claim Construction Order, that there could be no infringement once the patent emerged from re-examination. Thus, Defendants argued that this claim was objectively baseless as of February 27, 2014, when the claim emerged from re-examination.
Defendants argued further that, from its inception, this case was objectively frivolous and should not have been filed. Plaintiff argued that, even assuming its claims were baseless, Defendants should have raised the issue of non-infringement when the case resumed after re-examination. However, Defendants did not move for summary judgment on the issue of infringement; they only attempted to do so on the issue of damages.
2. Damages Claims.
Claiming that Defendants violated its provisional rights in the patent, Plaintiff sought $200 million in damages from June 4, 2009, the date on which Plaintiff filed the provisional patent application.
Entitlement to damages before re-examination requires Plaintiff to show that the original claims and the re-examined claims were substantially [*7] identical. Laitraim Corp. v. NEC Corp., 163 F.3d 1342 , 1346 (Fed. Cir. 1998). "If substantive changes have been made to the original claims, the patentee is entitled to infringement damages only for the period following the issuance of the reexamination certificate." Id . Thus, Plaintiff must prove that the claims were substantially identical from 2009 through 2014, when the patent emerged from re-examination. If there were any changes to the claims, then Plaintiff could only seek damages from re-examination onward.
Plaintiff argued that the re-examined claims were not substantively changed from the original claims. Plaintiff argued further that claim construction, which Order did not issue until December 1, 2014, bore on the issue of provisional rights.
In opposition, Defendants argued that Plaintiff was not entitled to damages since 2009, because the original claims and the re-examined claims were not identical. Plaintiff added over 100 words to the re-examined claim, including limitations that arguably established Defendants' non-infringement positions. In fact, Defendants unsuccessfully sought leave to file a summary judgment motion as to damages. (ECF No. 79). Moreover, Defendants argued that, even if claim construction bore on provisional rights, it was meaningless in this case because the published application and the issued patent were not substantially identical.
Defendants further argued that Plaintiff's claim against the estate of Borislow made the case exceptional because of the egregious effect it had on the estate and the family. Plaintiff maintained its $200 million claim against Mr. Borislow's estate even after he had ceased to be a part of the company. Moreover, the claim prevented his widow from making any distributions of the estate to any family or creditors.
Rather than addressing the merits of the damages claim, Plaintiff's argument focused on its conduct in attempting to resolve the case following the issuance of the claim construction order. Plaintiff argued that, almost immediately after retaining new counsel and evaluating the Court's claim construction order, Plaintiff began discussing entry of judgment of non-infringement in favor of Defendants, a stay of the proceedings to conserve resources pending an appeal to the Federal Circuit, and, shortly thereafter, a covenant against suit in favor of Defendants and dismissal of the entire case.
Analysis 
Based upon these facts, the Court is not persuaded that this case deserves an exceptionality designation. Although Octane Fitness loosened the framework for assessing exceptionality, it remains the exception to the rule. See Small, [2014 BL 309275], 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 154468 , 2014 WL 5463621 , at *3 (noting that, even after Octane Fitness, "courts continue to hold claims of baselessness to a high bar").
A court will generally not find a party with a good-faith argument in favor of its position to have made "exceptionally meritless" claims. See Small, [2014 BL 309275], 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 154468 , 2014 WL 5463621 , at *3; see also EON Corp. IP Holdings LLC, [2014 BL 206369], 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 101923 , 2014 WL 3726170 , at *5 (even when the plaintiff's argument was "quite stretched" and its conduct "difficult to explain," the court [*8] could not "quite conclude that no reasonable patentee could see an opening . . . through which the argument could be squeezed"); Gametek LLC v. Zynga, Inc., No. CV 13-2546 RS, [2014 BL 242104], 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 122834 , 2014 WL 4351414 , at *3 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 2, 2014) (while plaintiff's briefing, which "consisted of granular parsing of the claimed steps rather than any substantive explanation of how [the invention] differed from the underlying abstract idea," was inadequate, it "did not . . . descend to the level of frivolous argument or objective unreasonableness").
"Since Octane [Fitness], district courts have awarded fees when the patentee had a history of bringing nuisance value cases, was motivated by a bad faith desire to bankrupt the alleged infringer with litigation costs, resisted discovery requests, made no reasonable effort to verify the defendant's products infringed, engaged in inequitable conduct at the PTO, or made misrepresentations during the litigation." RLIS, Inc. v. Cerner Corp., No. 3:12-CV-209, [2015 BL 286510], 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 117560 , 2015 WL 5178072 , at * (S.D. Tex. Sept. 3, 2015); See Gametek, LLC, [2014 BL 242104], 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 122834 , 2014 WL 4351414 , at *3 (showing that a case is exceptional when it concerns egregious behavior). "[M]ost cases awarding fees continue to involve substantial litigation misconduct." Small, [2014 BL 309275], 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 154468 , 2014 WL 5463621 , at *3.
The infringement claims advanced by Plaintiff in this case were not so baseless as to support a fee award. See Old Reliable Wholesale, Inc. v. Cornell Corp., 635 F.3d 539 , 544 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (internal quotations omitted) ("Unless an argument or claim asserted in the course of litigation is so unreasonable that no reasonable litigant could believe it would succeed, it cannot be deemed objectively baseless for purposes of awarding attorney fees." Id. (internal quotations omitted)).
Plaintiff set forth a good faith argument with respect to the interpretation of the phrase, "multiple separate and independent internet access connections." See Small, [2014 BL 309275], 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 154468 , 2014 WL 5463621 , at *3 ("[If] a party has set forth some good faith argument in favor of its position, it will generally not be found to have advanced 'exceptionally meritless' claims"). Its claim construction argument falls into the category of a dispute over claim meaning that, while unlikely to prevail, was nonetheless legitimate to submit to the Court for resolution. The Court does not regard Plaintiff's interpretation as being so unreasonable as to make this an exceptional case. Such push-and-pull over the scope of claim language is common in patent litigation. In fact, that Plaintiff ultimately lost on its claim construction position, standing alone, is insufficient to support a finding of exceptionality within the context of § 285 . See SFA Sys., LLC v. Newegg, Inc., 793 F.3d at 1348 (the "correctness or eventual success" of a party's litigation position is not determinative of the attorney fee issue; "[a] party's position on issues of law ultimately need not be correct for them not to 'stand[ ] out,' or be found reasonable" (alteration in original)); See H-W Technology, Inc., [2014 BL 412484], 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 122667 , 2014 WL 4378750 , at *4 ("Plaintiff may have asserted a losing argument but this does not amount to the type of extraordinary misconduct reserved for finding a case exceptional"); Calypso Wireless, Inc. v. T—Mobile USA Inc., No. 2:08-CV-441, [2015 BL 59626], 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26871 , 2015 WL 1022745 , at *5 (E.D. Tex. Mar. 5, 2015) ("[T]he Court does not [*9] consider a case 'exceptional' simply because there is dispute over the construction of patent claims and that a defendant or plaintiff's construction proved to be incorrect—there must be more."); Bianco v. Globus Medical, Inc., No. 2:12-CV-00147, [2014 BL 293400], 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 67208 , 2014 WL 1904646 , at *2 (E.D. Tex. Apr. 17, 2014) (the fact that the Court ruled against the plaintiff on an issue does not mean that the defendant has shown that the plaintiff's position was frivolous). Indeed, an award of fees is not "a penalty for failure to win a patent infringement suit." Octane Fitness, 134 S.Ct. at 1753 (quoting Park-In-Theatres, Inc. v. Perkins, 190 F.2d 137 , 142 (9th Cir. 1951)); see Gaymar Indus., Inc. v. Cincinnati Sub-Zero Prods., Inc., 790 F.3d 1369 , 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2015) ("fees are not awarded solely because one party's position did not prevail").
With respect to the claim element not requiring claim construction, the Court agrees that Plaintiff's argument in this regard was weak and, possibly, meritless. Standing alone, however, it is insufficient to render this case extraordinary. See EON Corp. IP Holdings, LLC, [2014 BL 206369], 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 101923 , 2014 WL 3726170 , at *5 ("the Court agrees that EON's infringement contentions lack merit. But that by itself is not enough to render a case 'extraordinary).
Furthermore, as recently noted by the undersigned,
It is also important to note that no Rule 11 Motion was ever filed in this case. Here, Quintron insists that this case was objectionably frivolous from its inception and should never have been filed. Well, Rule 11 is the remedy for that.
Commonwealth Laboratories, Inc. v. Quintron Instrument Company, Inc., Case No. 1:14-cv-20083 -PAS, [2015 BL 454735], 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 176136 , Report and Recommendation dated 07/20/2015 (ECF No. 98). Yet, in this case, as in the one cited, Defendants never sought relief under any applicable rule.

After considering the totality of the circumstances, the undersigned cannot conclude that Defendants have met their burden of establishing that this case is "extraordinary" to warrant fee-shifting under the Patent Act. Therefore, in its discretion, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that the Court decline to award attorney's fees to Defendants under 35 U.S.C. § 285 .
3. Manner of Litigation.
Lastly, Defendants argued that Plaintiff's conduct in this case also warranted an exceptionality designation. In support, Defendants pointed to various discovery issues regarding depositions, expert reports, and production, but cited no cases finding similar conduct to be exceptional.
Plaintiff argued that, at the time the Court issued its Order on Claim Construction, on December 1, 2014, it did not have counsel. New counsel made an appearance on Plaintiff's behalf on January 1, 2015. A few days later, Plaintiff began working toward resolution of the case. The Court then granted Plaintiff a thirty-day extension due to counsel's spine surgery scheduled for January 28, 2015. Plaintiff argued that it was not unreasonable to wait until the new year to retain new counsel to review the Claim Construction Order for viability of claims. Defendants argued that, notwithstanding new counsel's efforts, Plaintiff's prior counsel had already maintained, for over two years, a lawsuit it knew, or should have known, was baseless.
The undersigned finds that, although [*10] the conduct of Plaintiff and Plaintiff's counsel in this litigation, at times, may have been less than desirable, it was not so unreasonable as to warrant a finding of exceptionality. Even if Plaintiff failed to prosecute the case as efficiently as possible, there was no evidence of egregious conduct justifying a fee award. See Adaptix, Inc. v. Apple, Inc., [2015 BL 285043], 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 117275 , 2015 WL 5158716 , at *2 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 2, 2015) ("While there can be no question that at times this case was not prosecuted as efficiently as possible, the court is not persuaded that any exceptional circumstances arose justifying an award of attorney's fees"). Assuming Plaintiff may have been guilty of failing to timely respond to discovery requests, there was no evidence that the delays caused any actual prejudice to Defendants' rights. In fact, contrary to Defendants' arguments concerning Plaintiff's failure to comply with Court-ordered discovery, the Court's deadline for the completion of discovery was March 2, 2015; however, this case was dismissed before that deadline, on February 27, 2015. Moreover, the Court notes that Defendants did not seek sanctions for the alleged discovery violations. Indeed, as Plaintiff argued, during the course of this entire litigation, no party was sanctioned for discovery abuses or otherwise.
In evaluating the totality of the circumstances and in view of the absence of Eleventh Circuit authority interpreting Octane Fitness, the Court finds an award of fees for an "exceptional" case under § 285 of the Patent Act to be inappropriate here, and, therefore, respectfully RECOMMENDS that Defendants' request for an award of fees under § 285 be DENIED.
At the hearing, Plaintiff argued, for the first time, that a $2 million sanction would put it out of business. Because the undersigned finds that this case does not warrant a fee award under § 285 , any consideration of Plaintiff's financial circumstances is deemed moot.
Defendants' Bill of Costs (ECF No. 160) 
Defendants indisputably became the prevailing party following Plaintiff's covenant not to sue and the Court's Rule 41(a)(2) dismissal with prejudice. Am. Tech. Inc. v. Am. Future Tech. Corp., No. 6:11-CV-113-ORL-22, [2012 BL 79483], 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 33992 , 2012 WL 859345 , at *1 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 14, 2012). As the prevailing party, Defendants sought to recover costs in the total amount of $39,719.27, as follows: (1) $695.00 in fees for the service of summons and subpoenas; (2) $15,901.11 in fees for printed or electronically recorded transcripts; (3) $139.50 in fees and disbursements for printing; and (4) $22,983.66 in fees for exemplification and copies. Plaintiff agreed that Defendants were entitled to recover costs in the amount of $6,664.35, but objected to the remaining costs of $33,054.92.
(1) Fees for service of summons/subpoenas. Defendants sought to recover the cost of subpoenas served on several third parties. Currently, the U.S. Marshal charges $65.00 per hour to serve a subpoena. 28 C.F.R. § 0.114(a)(3) . Plaintiff agreed that Defendants were entitled to recover $185.00 in costs for the service of subpoenas on Leo Manzewitsch, Costas Papadopoulos, and Alex Hewko, but objected to the remaining $510.00 in costs for service of document subpoenas.
The undersigned [*11] finds that the costs incurred in serving document subpoenas are recoverable. See Burke-Thompson v. Baptist Health S. Florida, Inc., 06-20766-CIV, [2008 BL 372622], 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 88920 , 2008 WL 4791018 , at *3 (S.D. Fla. Nov. 3, 2008) (allowing recovery of costs of service of process fees for subpoenas served for documents and/or for attendance at depositions); Spatz v. Microtel Inns & Suites Franchising, Inc., 11-60509-CIV, [2012 BL 428868], 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63112 , 2012 WL 1587663 , at *2 (S.D. Fla. May 4, 2012) (allowing recovery of costs for service of two document-production subpoenas by private process servers). Thus, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendants recover the full amount of $695.00 in fees for service of subpoenas.
(2) Fees for printed or electronically recorded transcripts. Defendants sought to recover costs in the total amount of $15,901.11 for the transcripts of four hearings and five depositions.
A. Pre-trial Hearings. The pre-trial hearing transcripts totaled $1,381.26, as follows: (1) July 25, 2014 Status Conference; (2) September 10, 2014 Markman Hearing; (3) December 11, 2014 Motion Hearing; and (4) January 28, 2015 Status/Scheduling Conference.
Defendants argued that the July 25, 2014 and December 11, 2014 hearings contained rulings that were not memorialized in a court order. At the July 25, 2014 hearing, Plaintiff stipulated that it was only pursuing claim 3, and the Court ruled that Plaintiff must show good cause to later assert another claim. At the hearing on December 11, 2014, the Court instructed Defendants not to file a motion to compel until new counsel appeared for Plaintiff, which motion would not be deemed untimely. With respect to the Markman hearing, Defendants argued that its importance was on par with a trial, as it was an evidentiary proceeding including substantial opposing expert testimony. With respect to the January 28, 2015 hearing, Plaintiff admitted that it could not prevail. Plaintiff argued that the transcript was not necessary because it had admitted that it could not prevail during settlement discussions. Finally, Plaintiff argued that Defendants did not establish why the transcripts were ordered on an expedited basis.

Sept. 23, 2011) report and recommendation adopted, [2011 BL 263193], 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 117720 , 2011 WL 4836229 (M.D. Fla. Oct. 12, 2011) (quoting U.S. Fire Ins. Co. v. Mikes, No. 8:04-cv-2783-T-23TBM, [2008 BL 42889], 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 125150 , 2008 WL 61602 , at *3 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 3, 2008)).
The undersigned agrees that Defendants are entitled to recover the costs of the hearing transcripts. However, in the absence of evidence that it was necessary to expedite the transcripts for these hearings, the Court finds that those costs should not be allowed. Rodriguez v. Marble Care Intern., Inc., 862 F.Supp.2d 1316 , 1320 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 8, 2012); Licausi v. Symantec Corp., No. 08-60544-CIV, [2009 BL 208407], 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 95417 , 2009 WL 3177566 , at *3 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 29, 2009) ("[F]ees for expedited or condensed transcripts, compressed and miniscript versions, and CD ROM's with ASCII are not reimbursable under § 1920 ").
Therefore, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendants be awarded $1,057.26 in costs for the hearing transcripts, which is calculated at the ordinary rate of $4.02 per page.
B. [*12] Depositions. Plaintiff did not object to the recovery of the cost of the deposition transcripts for: (1) inventor Leo Manzewitsch; (2) expert witness Frank Koperda; (3) expert witness John Garney; (4) NetTalk executive Nick Kyriakides; and (5) inventor Garry Paxinos. As such, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendants recover the amount of $6,014.35 in deposition transcripts.
In addition, Defendants sought to recover various other costs associated with the depositions as follows:
1. Rough Transcript. Defendants sought to recover the cost of the rough transcripts for Koperda's deposition who was deposed the day before the Markman hearing. Plaintiff did not object. Thus, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendants recover the cost of the rough transcript in the amount of $325.50.
2. Court Reporter Attendance Fee. Defendants also requested taxation of the court reporter's attendance fee for each deposition, totaling $1,620.00. Plaintiff objected citing a case from this District wherein such costs were denied. However, the undersigned notes that numerous courts, including this one, have ruled that attendance fees of court reporters are taxable costs, because it is necessary for the court reporter to appear, record the testimony, and then prepare the deposition transcript. See Rodriguez v. M.I. Quality Lawn Maint., Inc., No. 10-21031-CIV, [2012 BL 428600], 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25095 , 2012 WL 664275 , at *4 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 9, 2012) (collecting cases). This Court agrees that the appearance fees of the court reporters are directly related to transcript preparation. Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that the court reporter appearance fees in the amount of $1,620.00 be taxed as costs.
3. Videotaped Depositions. Defendants sought to recover costs, totaling $6,560.00, for the videos of all five depositions, as well as costs ancillary thereto, such as fees for the time of the videographer. All of the depositions were noticed to be recorded by both stenographic and non-stenographic means. There is no claim that Plaintiff objected to the format of these depositions at the time they were taken.
The costs of a video deposition may be allowed when a party notices a deposition to be recorded by both stenographic and non-stenographic means, no objection is raised by the other party at that time to the method of recordation, and copies of the videos were necessarily obtained for use in the case. Morrison v. Reichhold Chems., Inc., 97 F.3d 460 , 465 (11th Cir. 1996); J.G. v. Carnival Corp., 12-21089-CIV, [2013 BL 398765], 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141197 , 2013 WL 5446412 , at *3 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 28, 2013). The prevailing party must explain why it was necessary to obtain both a transcript and a videotaped recording of a deposition. Castillo v. Roche Laboratories, Inc., No. 10-20876-CV, [2012 BL 43343], 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14114 , 2012 WL 381200 , at * 3 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 6, 2012); Scottsdale Ins. Co. v. Wave Technologies Communications, Inc., No. 8:07-cv-1329-T-30MAP, [2012 BL 64208], 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30342 , 2012 WL 750317 , at * 2 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 7, 2012).
Defendants argued that there was no guarantee that the witnesses would be within the subpoena power of the court at the time of trial, and that Plaintiff had chosen to videotape the deposition of its own expert as well. All but one of the witnesses were either third-party witnesses or witnesses within Plaintiff's control. Though Garney [*13] was Defendants' expert witness, they could not be sure that he would be available for trial. Plaintiff objected arguing that not knowing whether the witnesses would be available for trial was insufficient to support this expenditure because these witnesses could be subpoenaed pursuant to Rule 45 .
Defendants have not shown that both methods of recording were necessary. Accordingly, Defendants may recover the costs of the stenographic transcripts but are not entitled to the disputed videotaping costs of the same witnesses. DuChateau v. Camp Dresser & McKee, Inc., No. 10-60712-CIV, [2012 BL 89809], 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43410 , 2012 WL 1069166 , at *3 (S.D. Fla. Mar. 29, 2012); D.B. v. Orange County, Fla., No. 6:13-cv-434-Orl-31DAB, [2015 BL 51503], 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23466 , 2015 WL 847293 , at *2-3 (M.D. Fla. Feb. 26, 2015). Thus, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that the cost of the video depositions not be taxed against Plaintiff.
(3) Fees and disbursements for printing. Plaintiff did not object to Defendants' request for printing fees. As such, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendants recover $139.50 in printing fees.
(4) Fees for exemplification and copies. Defendants sought to recover $13,005.39 for photocopies, and $9,978.27 for time spent in preparing documents for production. Plaintiff objected to both of these costs. Upon review of the materials, the Court concludes that only a portion of copying was sufficiently supported as reasonably necessary.
Plaintiff argued that Defendants had not shown that the copies were necessarily obtained for use in the case as they did not show the nature of the copied documents or how they were used in the case. Moreover, Defendants provided no supporting affidavit that the copies were actually used at any depositions.
It is well-established that the movant must provide information regarding the purpose of the copies and whether they related to the claims at issue. See Helms v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 808 F. Supp. 1568 , 1570 (N.D. Ga. 1992), aff'd, 998 F.2d 1023 (11th Cir. 1993); see also Lee v. American Eagle Airlines, Inc., 93 F.Supp.2d 1322 , 1335-36 (S.D. Fla. 2000) (declining to tax photocopy costs lacking description).
Defendants argued that it was apparent from the date of the copies that the majority were effected for purposes of depositions occurring in August 2014, November 2014, or February 2015. While the attached invoices roughly correspond to those dates, almost no details were provided regarding the purpose of each copy order or the general content of the documents. Absent such information, the Court cannot evaluate whether the requested copying charges were necessary and reasonable. See Brooks v. Peer Review Mediation and Arbitration, Inc., No. 11-61630-CIV, [2012 BL 292226], 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 158980 , 2012 WL 5410405 , at *5 (S.D. Fla. Nov. 6, 2012); see also Monelus v. Tocodrian, Inc., 609 F.Supp.2d 1328 , 1335 (S.D. Fla. 2009) (explaining that the prevailing party "cannot simply make unsubstantiated claims that copies of the documents were necessary"). Consequently, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that these costs not be taxed against Plaintiff.
Two of the three invoices (6/17/2014 TransPerfect Invoice, and 8/29/2014 Ricoh Invoice) from outside vendors indicated that the copies were made for depositions. The Transperfect invoice totaled $3,579.14 in black and white copies, at .10 per page, and color copies, at .79 per [*14] page. The Ricoh invoice totaled $2,448.40 in black and white copies, at .10 per page, and color copies, at .75 per page. The undersigned finds that these invoices may be taxed against Plaintiff. In this connection, the undersigned finds that the requested rate of $.10 per black and white copies is reasonable. James v. Wash Depot Holdings, Inc., 242 F.R.D. 645 , 652 (S.D. Fla. 2007) (holding reasonable rate of ten cents per page for copying in Southern District). However, the rate of $.79 per page for color copies is not within the reasonable range of rates for the Southern District of Florida. See Castillo v. Teledyne Continental Motors, Inc., No. 08-21850-CV, [2011 BL 420847], 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 38080 , 2011 WL 1343051 , at *4 FN 14 (S.D. Fla. Mar. 16, 2011) (finding rate of $.35 to be reasonable for color copies). Given limited guidance on this issue, the undersigned finds that the rate for the color copies should be reduced to $.3 5 per page. As such, for these two invoices, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendants recover $3,464.90 in black and white copies and color copies at the reduced rate.
The remaining invoice from outside vendor Ricoh, dated 7/9/14, in the amount of $244.20, does not specify what the copies were for and so is not recoverable. As such, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that these costs not be taxed against Plaintiff.
The Court will accept that the charges incurred on 6/30/14, 7/31/14, 9/30/14, and 10/31/14, totaling $747.27, were for discovery. The undersigned finds that the balance of the requested copying costs are not recoverable, as Defendants failed to specifically identify that they were necessarily incurred and were not merely for convenience and failed to show the nature of the copied documents or how they were used in the case.
Accordingly, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendants be awarded a total of $4,212.17 in copying costs.
B. Document Production. Defendants sought to recover the costs of preparing documents for production in-house by either Fenwick & West, LLP, or Vinson & Elkins, LLP. Plaintiff objected to this expenditure arguing that it constituted paralegal time for preparing and processing documents for production, at an hourly rate of $260.00, which was not recoverable under § 1920 . Defendants argued that the individuals who spent time preparing documents for production—David Tran, Brad Bonnington, Janice Sossaman, Lynn Young, and Laura McDuffie—were not paralegals, but rather in-house technology and document production specialists. Moreover, Defendants argued that they likely saved substantial sums of money by preparing documents for production in-house rather than outsourcing to a vendor.
Though § 1920 has been broadened to allow for copying materials, as opposed to just papers, many courts, including Race Tires America, Inc. v. Hoosier Racing Tire Corp., 674 F.3d 158 , 169 (3d Cir. 2012), Country Vintner of North Carolina, LLC v. E. & J. Gallo Winery, Inc., 718 F.3d 249 , 260 (4th Cir. 2013), and Finnerty v. Stiefel Laboratories, Inc., 900 F.Supp.2d 1317 , 1322 (S.D. Fla. 2012), have concluded that the amended statute, though broader, does not permit the taxation of all electronic discovery costs. In Race Tires, the Third Circuit persuasively reasoned that "only the conversion of native files to TIFF (the [*15] agreed-upon default format for production of electronic discovery), and the scanning of documents to create digital duplicates are generally recognized as the taxable 'making copies of material.'" Race Tires, 674 F.3d at 167 . Although the Eleventh Circuit has not adopted Race Tires, the undersigned finds the Third Circuit's reasoning persuasive. "A holding to the contrary . . . would muddy the distinction between taxable costs, which are generally available to the prevailing party, and attorneys fees, which generally are not available absent a fee-shifting agreement or statute." Finnerty, 900 F.Supp.2d at 1322 .
Invoices for 6/17/14, 7/30/14, 7/31/14, 8/8/14, 9/4/14, 9/10/14, 10/8/14, 10/14/14, 10/16/14, totaling $3,263.00, set forth that they were for preparation of data in anticipation of document production. This description is insufficient for the Court to determine whether the costs are properly recoverable under § 1920 . Invoices for 12/1/14, 12/2/14, 12/4/14, 12/4/14, 12/9/14, 12/10/14, totaling $5,968.00, set forth that they were for, inter alia, preparation of production disks for production; production processing; creation of production database; identification of documents for production; and preparation of source code files for production. None of these tasks appear to constitute making copies under § 1920 . As such, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that these costs be denied in their entirety.
Recommendation 
Accordingly, it is hereby RESPECTFULLY RECOMMENDED that Defendants' Motion for Attorneys' Fees Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 285 (ECF No. 166) be DENIED, Defendants' Bill of Costs (ECF No. 160) be GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART, as set forth herein, and Defendants recover the amount of $14,063.78 in costs.
Pursuant to S.D. Fla. Magistrate Rule 4(b) , the parties may serve and file written objections to this Recommendation with the Honorable Darrin P. Gayles, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Florida, within fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this Report and Recommendation. Failure to file timely objections shall bar the parties from attacking on appeal any factual findings contained herein. RTC v. Hallmark Builders, Inc., 996 F.2d 1144 (11th Cir. 1993); LoConte v. Dugger, 847 F.2d 745 (11th Cir. 1988).
RESPECTFULLY RECOMMENDED in Chambers at Miami, Florida, this 20th day of November 2015.

THOMAS B. SMITH, United States Magistrate Judge.

THOMAS B. SMITH 
ORDER
Pending before the Court are two motions to seal (Docs. 110, 114). For the reasons that follow, the motions are due to be granted.
I. Standard 
Middle District of Florida Rule 1.09 requires a party filing a motion to seal to (1) identify and describe each item proposed for sealing; (2) provide the reason why filing each item is necessary; (3) explain the reason why sealing each item is necessary; (4) state why a means other than sealing is unavailable or unsatisfactory to preserve the interest advanced by the movant in support of the motion to seal; (5) suggest the proposed duration of the seal; and (6) provide a memorandum of law supporting the seal. M.D. Fla. R. 1.09 .
In addition to Local Rule 1.09 , the law provides that "[t]he operations of the courts and the judicial conduct of judges are matters of utmost public concern,'" Romero v. Drummond Co., Inc., 480 F.3d 1234 , 1245 (11th Cir. 2007) (quoting Landmark Commc'ns, Inc. v. Virginia, 435 U.S. 829 , 839 , 98 S. Ct. 1535 , 56 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1978)), "and '[t]he common-law right of access to judicial proceedings, an essential component of our system of justice, is instrumental in securing the integrity of the process.'" Id . (quoting Chicago Tribune Co. v. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., 263 F.3d 1304 , 1311 (11th Cir. 2001)). "Beyond establishing a general presumption that criminal and civil actions should be conducted publicly, the common-law right of access includes the right to inspect and copy public records and documents." Chicago Tribune Co., 263 F.3d at 1311 (citing Nixon v. Warner Commc'ns Inc., 435 U.S. 589 , 597 , 98 S. Ct. 1306 , 55 L. Ed. 2d 570 (1978)). "The common law right of access may be overcome by a showing of good cause, which requires 'balanc[ing] the asserted right of access against the other party's interest in keeping the information confidential.'" Romero, 480 F.3d at 1246 (quoting Chicago Tribune Co., 263 F.3d at 1309 . In balancing these interests,
courts consider, among other factors, whether allowing access would impair court functions or harm legitimate privacy interests, the degree of and likelihood of injury if made public, the reliability of the information, whether there will be an opportunity to respond to the information, [*2] whether the information concerns public officials or public concerns, and the availability of a less onerous alternative to sealing the documents.
Id . 

A party's interest in the privacy of its financial records and the terms of confidential agreements oftentimes outweighs the public's right of access. Graphic Packaging Int'l, Inc. v. C.W. Zumbiel Co., No. 3:10-CV-891-J-JBT, [2010 BL 397800], 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 143284 , 2010 WL 6790538 , at *2 (M.D. Fla. Oct. 27, 2010). Nevertheless, the parties' agreement to seal court documents "is immaterial" to the public's right of access. Brown v. Advantage Eng'g, Inc., 960 F.2d 1013 , 1016 (11th Cir. 1992). Where, as here, documents are filed in connection with a motion to compel discovery, they are not subject to the common-law right of access. Chicago Tribune Co., 263 F.3d at 1312 .
II. Discussion 
Plaintiffs seek to seal Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Production of Documents and ESI, and Better Responses to Request for Production (Doc. 90) and Exhibit C attached thereto, and Plaintiff's Renewed Motion to Compel Better Answers to Interrogatories (Doc. 91) and Exhibit C attached thereto. (Doc. 114). Defendant seeks to seal Exhibits K through N attached to Peerless' Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion and Supplemental Motion to Compel Corporate Representative Deposition of Defendant Following Discovery Deadline (Doc. 106). (Doc. 110). Both motions are unopposed, and the parties assert that the documents sought to be sealed contain confidential business records that have been designated as "Confidential" pursuant to the protective order in this case.
Plaintiffs seek to seal Exhibit C to Docs. 90 and 91 because Exhibit C is a confidential business record; Exhibit C is an email that contains information about Defendant's prepaid calling card clients. Plaintiffs also seek to seal Docs. 90 and 91 because they quote Exhibit C. Defendant seeks to seal Exhibits K-N of Doc. 106, which are deposition transcripts that have been designated "Confidential" and contain confidential business records, including pricing information, the identity of Defendant's customers, contract terms, and revenue.
The Court finds that, for purposes of the motions to compel pending before the Court, the parties' interests in the privacy of their financial records outweighs the public's right of access. The parties' motions to seal (Docs. 110, 114) are therefore GRANTED. The Clerk is DIRECTED to seal Docs. 90, 90-3, 91, 91-3, 106-11, 106-12, 106-13, and 106-14. The Clerk shall maintain the documents under seal until the earlier of: (1) an order unsealing the documents; (2) one year from the date of this Order; or (3) the conclusion of the case, including any appeals. Prior to the expiration of the seal, any party may file a motion to extend the seal of any or all of these documents.
Defendant attached redacted copies of Docs. 106-11, 106-12, 106-13, and 106-14 to its motion (See Docs. 110-1, 110-2, 110-3, and 110-4). Plaintiffs are ORDERED to file redacted copies of Docs. 90, 90-3, 91, and 91-3 within fourteen (14) days.
DONE and ORDERED in Orlando, Florida on September 24, 2015.

KARLA R. SPAULDING, UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE.

KARLA R. SPAULDING 
Report And Recommendation
TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT: 
This cause came on for consideration after an evidentiary hearing on the following motion filed herein:
MOTION: MOTION TO SUPPRESS EVIDENCE (Doc. No. 52) 
FILED: October 16, 2013 

I. BACKGROUND. 
On June 12, 2013, a federal grand jury returned an Indictment charging Husein Kermali and Sikander Kermali with Conspiracy to Commit Theft of Government Property in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371 (Count One); Conspiracy to Commit Wire Fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1349 (Count Two); and Wire Fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343 (Counts Three through Eight). Doc. No. 25.
Husein Kermali filed the above-referenced motion to suppress from use at trial items seized from his residence at 3631 Pine Oak Trail, Sanford, Florida (hereinafter the "Subject Property") pursuant to a search warrant issued by a United States Magistrate Judge. In sum, the motion argues that (1) the search warrant was overbroad and lacked the necessary particularity regarding items to be searched for and seized; (2) that the search warrant affidavit did not provide a sufficient nexus between the Subject Property and the items to be searched for and seized; and, (3) that law enforcement agents seized items beyond the scope of the search warrant, specifically precious metals (including coins)1 and firearms. Doc. No. 52.2 The United States filed a response to the motion. Doc. No. 58. The motion was referred to me for issuance of a Report and Recommendation. Doc. No. 53.
I held an evidentiary hearing on the motion on October 22, 2013. Doc. No. 64. At the beginning of the hearing, the United States conceded that Husein Kermali has standing to bring a motion to suppress as to items seized from the Subject Property.  Id. at 6. The United States also indicated that items allegedly seized beyond the scope of the search warrant likely would not be introduced in the guilt phase of the trial but might be offered into evidence to establish property subject to forfeiture if Husein Kermali is convicted.  Id. at 4. The United States does not contend that a motion to suppress is not applicable to evidence likely to be used only in the forfeiture stage of a criminal trial.
A transcript of the evidentiary hearing has been prepared and filed. Doc. No. 64. The motion is now ripe for resolution.
II. RELEVANT FACTS FROM THE SEARCH WARRANT AFFIDAVIT. 
In November 2011, the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI"), the Army Criminal Investigation Division ("CID"), and [*2] the General Services Administration ("GSA) and its Office of Inspector General ("OIG") began a joint investigation concerning the theft of government property and interstate transportation of stolen goods. Doc. No. 52-1 ¶ 5. The investigation revealed that while assigned to a U.S. Army Reserve unit, an individual who later became a confidential informant ("CI") made unauthorized purchases of goods on the Internet using the GSA Advantage Program and GSA Global Supply websites (collectively, the "GSA website"). The CI used Department of Defense Activity Account Codes, without authority to do so, to purchase these goods. Id. ¶¶ 5, 7. An audit of this activity revealed that the CI had directed that the fraudulently purchased goods be shipped to the CI's residence and to a warehouse located at 311 Specialty Point, Sanford, Florida (the "Warehouse"), discussed in more detail below. Id. ¶¶ 3, 6, 11. Shipping records and GSA Advantage Program customer records show that deliveries to the Warehouse were signed for by H. Kermali, Tony Kermali, and another unidentified person. Id. ¶ 11.
In December 2010, Husein Kermali contacted the CI regarding power tools that the CI had listed for sale on Craigslist. The CI subsequently met with Husein Kermali and his brother, Sikander Kermali who used the name Tony. Id. ¶ 9. They discussed the Kermalis' interest in buying computer-related items that the CI could purchase through the GSA website at 15% of the price advertised for those goods on the website. Id. 
Thereafter, the Kermalis bought many goods that the CI fraudulently acquired via the GSA website. Ultimately, the CI began shipping the fraudulently acquired goods to the Warehouse, which was operated by NRK Distributors, Inc. ("NRK"). Husein Kermali is the registered agent and president of NRK, and the business address of record for NRK is the Subject Property. Id. ¶¶ 3, 9, 11, 13.
In December 2011, the CI began cooperating with law enforcement. Id. ¶ 7. Thereafter, the CI participated in an undercover operation through which he purchased specific goods requested by the Kermalis using covert funds supplied by the FBI and GSA. Id. ¶ 15. The CI communicated with the Kermalis verbally and in text messages using their respective cellular telephones. The CI also met with the Kermalis in person. Id. ¶¶ 15, 16. Husein Kermali also communicated with the CI through his email account, hkermali@me.com. Id. ¶¶ 17, 38.
On January 4, 2012, Husein Kermali sent an email to the CI requesting to purchase drill kits that the CI could obtain from the GSA website. Id. ¶ 17. On January 10, 2012, Tony Kermali requested to purchase printers that the CI could obtain from the GSA website. Id. ¶ 18. The CI, at the direction of law enforcement, purchased these items. Id. ¶ 19.
On January 26, 2012, the CI met with the Kermalis at the Warehouse to deliver the items the Kermalis had ordered. The meeting was surreptitiously recorded. Id. ¶ 22. While at the Warehouse, the CI observed two desktop computers, including one in the office of Husein Kermali. Id. 
On February 28, 2012, the CI again met with the Kermalis at the Warehouse to deliver additional goods, including [*3] the power tool kits. The Kermalis paid the CI with a check drawn on the account of Kermali Investment, Inc. Kermali Investments, Inc. is a Florida corporation with its address of record at the Subject Property. Husein Kermali is the President of Kermali Investments, Inc. Id. ¶ 25 & n. 15.
Thereafter, through April 12, 2012, the Kermalis continued to place orders for items with the CI, which the CI continued to fill. Id. ¶¶ 26-37. Among other things, the Kermalis purchased weapon lights and weapon sights. Id. ¶ 29 & nn. 16, 17.
In April 2012, the CI observed various guns at the Warehouse contained in what appeared to be computer-laptop cases. Id. ¶ 33. Tony Kermali asked the CI if he could get armor-piercing ammunition. Id. ¶ 33.
On April 22, 2012, the CI met with Husein Kermali at a car wash located in Lake Mary, Florida to deliver weapon lights previously ordered. This car wash was managed by Husein Kermali and its principal address and mailing address are the Subject Property. Id. ¶ 36 & n. 18.
Records obtained from eBay and PayPal showed that the Kermalis sold the items acquired from the CI on those websites under seller identifications LUVMYLEX and MICROTECHDIST. The accounts were administered using the email account hkermali@microdist.com, among others, and were associated with the email account hkermali@me.com. Id. ¶¶ 55-58. Records show that buyers on LUVMYFLEX sent 394 messages to the email hkermali@microdist.com from December 2010 to February 2012. Id. ¶ 56. Subpoenas revealed that the IP address 97.104.79.110 was used to access these accounts more than 100 times between August 2011 and February 2012. IP address 97.104.79.110 was associated with the Subject Property, and the screen name of the user was HKermali. Id. ¶¶ 56, 57. As of May 3, 2012, LUVMYLEX and MICRTECHDIST still had open accounts and LUVMYLEX was then continuing to sell goods. Id. ¶ 58.
The Kermalis also sold items acquired from the CI on TradeKey.com using the name NRK Distributors, Inc. Husein Kermali was listed as the manager on the website using the address of the Warehouse. Id. ¶ 61.
PayPal records showed that the money the Kermalis obtained though sale of items obtained from the CI were electronically transferred to bank accounts that the Kermalis owned or controlled. Id. ¶ 59. The Kermalis paid the CI through checks drawn on accounts with the payor being MicroTech Distribution, Inc. and Kermali Investments, Inc. Id. ¶¶ 22, 25.
III. THE SEARCH WARRANT. 
The United States sought a search warrant for the Subject Property to seek records, including electronically stored information ("ESI"). Id. ¶ 64. The search warrant affidavit contemplated that computers and other electronic storage media might have to be seized for off-site review and, thereafter, be returned. Id. ¶¶ 68, 69, 70.
The search warrant authorized the United States to search for and seize the following:
Anything that constitutes fruits, evidence and instrumentalities of violations of 18 U.S.C. § 2314 (Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property) including:
a. Financial account statements or bank statements, including deposit slips, deposit books or ledgers, withdrawal slips, [*4] cleared checks, carbons of written checks, certificates of deposit, wire transfers, safe deposit boxes, and any other financial documents;
b. Any and all invoices and correspondence related to GSA, to include GSA Global Supply and GSA Advantage;
c. Any and all invoices, correspondence, and records related to customers and clients;
d. Any and all invoices, correspondence, and records related to dealers, wholesalers, sales representatives, and independent contractors;
e. Any and all invoices, correspondence, and records regarding any firearms, ammunition, and accessories [t]o include purchase, sale, trade, barter, negotiation, repair, licensing, shipping and receiving;
f. Any and all invoices, correspondence, and records reflecting the purchase, sale, trade, barter, negotiation, shipping and receiving of any securities, certificates of deposit, or precious metals;
g. Any and all records made in connection with purchase and/or sale of any real estate, including records which indicate the location of the property, dates of the real estate closing, the name of the parties to the real estate transactions, and the closing sheet or settlement statement/HUD-1 which reflects the source and distribution of the proceeds;
h. Any and all employment records to include current and former employees;
I. Any and all shipping records, to include invoices, shipments/deliveries received and/or sent, and shipping logs;
j. Any records or documents pertaining to the preparation, purchase, and acquisition of names or lists of names to be used in connection with the purchase, sale, trade, or transmission, through interstate commerce;
k. Electronically stored communications or messages reflecting computer on line chat sessions or email messages;
l. Any documents, records, programs, or applications that identify the residents of the residences and the businesses;
m. Any documents, records, programs or applications that identify the Internet service provided to the Premises and businesses[.]
Doc. No. 52-2 at 5.

IV. EXECUTION OF THE SEARCH WARRANT AT THE SUBJECT PROPERTY. 
Debra R. Weyrauch, an FBI Special Agent and the lead agent in the investigation of the CI and the Kermalis, testified at the suppression hearing. Doc. No. 64 at 7-8. Agent Weyrauch summarized the investigation leading to the issuance of the search warrant. Subpoenas had been served to obtain information about IP addresses and various companies associated with the activity under investigation and records from websites, including eBay and PayPal, through which the fraudulently acquired items were sold.  Id. at 21-22. Subpoenas were also issued for bank records, and agents reviewed a lot of records related to the purchase of items through the GSA website.  Id. at 20-21.
The search of the Subject Property began at about 6:45 a.m. on May 17, 2012.  Id. at 10. Before entering the search site, every agent was briefed on the investigation and was required to have reviewed the search warrant affidavit and attachments.  Id. at 30. Agents conducting the search should have had copies of the search warrant affidavit [*5] and attachments. Id. 
Agents executing the search warrant located two safes within the Subject Property. Inside the safes they found gold bars, coins and other precious metals (collectively "precious metals").  Id. at 11-12. Firearms were found around both of the safes.  Id. at 12. Additionally, agents found some computers, cell phones, and documentation.  Id. at 11. See generally Doc. No. 52-3 (search warrant inventory).
During the investigation, law enforcement learned that the Kermalis were purchasing guns during the time period of the alleged conspiracy.  Id. at 15. The agents did not seize 10 guns that Husein or Sikander Kermali identified as having been purchased before the time period of the alleged conspiracy.  Id. at 15-16.
During the investigation, law enforcement also learned that Husein Kermali was purchasing precious metals during the time frame of the alleged conspiracy.  Id. at 14-15. During an interview while the search was being conducted, Husein Kermali confirmed that he had purchased precious metals during the time frame of the alleged conspiracy.  Id. at 14.3 Husein Kermali asked to access his trading account online account to identify what precious metals he purchased before the time frame of the conspiracy, but there is no evidence that he was permitted to do so.  Id. at 36. Agent Weyrauch testified that because Husein Kermali could not identify which precious metals he purchased before the time frame of the alleged conspiracy, all of the precious metals were seized as possible proceeds (fruits) of the crime.  Id. at 23-24, 27, 31-32. This decision was made after consultation with Agent Weyrauch's supervisor, FBI legal counsel and an Assistant United States Attorney.  Id. at 31. Agents did not seize cash and gift cards found in the Subject Property because Husein Kermali stated that these items were not related to his dealings with the CI.  Id. at 16.
Subsequent investigation revealed that some of the precious metals seized were purchased before the time frame of the alleged conspiracy, but none of the precious metals had been returned to Husein Kermali as of the date of the hearing.  Id. at 32-33.
V. ANALYSIS. 
Husein Kermali raises two grounds to suppress all of the items seized from the Subject Property: (1) that the search warrant was overbroad and did not specify with particularity the items to be seized; and, (2) that the search warrant lacked probable cause because it did not provide a nexus between his residence and shipping and real estate records, precious metals and firearms located there. He also argues that the firearms and precious metals seized during the execution of the search warrant must be suppressed because the seizure of these items exceeded the scope of the warrant.
The standard of review is whether, granting great deference to the decision of the issuing Magistrate Judge, the evidence contained in the affidavit viewed as a whole provided a substantial basis for the finding of probable cause. See Mass. v. Upton, 466 U.S. 727 , 732-33 , 104 S. Ct. 2085 , 80 L. Ed. 2d 721 (1984); see also United States v. Kilgore, No. 1:11-cr-518-CAP-RGV, [2012 BL 430234], 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 154148 , 2012 WL 5334298 , at * 3-4 (N.D. Ga. Sept. 13, 2012).
A. Overbreadth and [*6] Particularity. 
"In order for a search to be reasonable, the warrant must be specific. Specificity has two aspects: particularity and breadth. Particularity is the requirement that the warrant must clearly state what is sought. Breadth deals with the requirement that the scope of the warrant be limited by the probable cause on which the warrant is based." United States v. Maali, 346 F. Supp. 2d 1226 , 1239 (M.D. Fla. 2004) (citation and quotations omitted). "A description in a search warrant is sufficient and particular when 'it enables the searcher to reasonably ascertain and identify the things authorized to be seized' and prevents 'general, exploratory rummaging in a person's belongings.'" United States v. Maharaj, No. 07-80024-CR-CR, [2007 BL 309307], 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 102622 , 2007 WL 2254559 , at * 11 (S.D. Fla. Aug. 2, 2007) (quoting United States v. Wuagneux, 683 F.2d 1343 , 1348-49 (11th Cir.1982)). "A search warrant is overbroad and unconstitutional when it fails to 'sufficiently particularize' the place to be searched or 'the things to be seized.'" Id . ( quoting United States v. Travers, 233 F.3d 1327 , 1329 (11th Cir.1985)).
Husein Kermali argues that Attachment B to the search warrant for the Subject Property is overbroad because it permitted law enforcement to search for and seize "[a]nything that constitutes fruits, evidence and instrumentalities of violations of 18 U.S.C. § 2314 (Interstate Transportation of Sole Property) including [13 categories of items]." He submits that the reference to § 2314 is insufficient to link the items to be seized to fruits, evidence and instrumentalities of the crime described in the search warrant affidavit. He further argues that the list of categories of items to be seized is insufficient to meet the particularity requirement because "it was left to the agents to decide what was, and what was not, a 'fruit' or 'instrumentality' of the crime." Doc. No. 52 at 4.
Defense counsel is correct that the Search and Seizure Warrant, Doc. No. 52-2, did not specifically incorporate the search warrant affidavit containing the facts of the investigation of the alleged violation of § 2314 by Husein Kermali. However, the search warrant affidavit provided ample probable cause to believe that Husein Kermali was engaged in interstate transportation of stolen property by acquiring items fraudulently obtained from the GSA website and then advertising and selling these stolen items in interstate commerce over the internet.
The United States presented evidence that each agent executing the search was briefed on the search to be conducted and had read the search warrant affidavit and attachments thereto. This is sufficient to establish that the agents executing the search warrant were adequately advised of the scope of the alleged crime underlying the search and of the items that constituted evidence, fruits and instrumentalities of the crime. Courts have found that a defect in the breadth and particularity requirements in a search warrant may be cured by the searching agents reading and reviewing the search warrant affidavit and through pre-search agent briefings. See Wuagneux, 683 F.2d 1343 , 1350-51 & n.6; Maharaj, [2007 BL 309307], 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 102622 , 2007 WL 2254559 , at * 12-13; Maali, 346 F. Supp. 2d at 1243 .
Furthermore, "[i]t is universally recognized that the particularity [*7] requirement must be applied with a practical margin of flexibility, depending on the type of property to be seized, and that a description of property will be acceptable if it is as specific as the circumstances and nature of activity under investigation permit." Wuagneux, 683 F.2d at 1349 . In this case, the search warrant affidavit established probable cause to believe that the Kermalis used a number of business entities and locations to conduct their criminal activities and transferred the proceeds of the criminal activity to bank accounts owned or controlled by them. Therefore, the general description of categories of documents to be seized was as specific as possible considering the scope of the alleged criminal activity. See Maali, 346 F. Supp. 2d at 1239-42 .
The "particularity" requirement with respect to authorization to search for and seize fruits and instrumentalities of the crime is also drawn as narrowly as could be expected and allowed the searching agents to reasonably ascertain and identify items within those categories. In Wuagneux, the Eleventh Circuit found that authorization to search for "property that constitutes evidence of the above-enumerated offenses, fruits of the crimes named-above and property which is or has been used to commit the crimes enumerated herein" was sufficiently particular. 683 F.2d at 1350 n.5.4 
For these reasons, Husein Kermali's first assignment of error is not well taken.
B. Insufficient Nexus Between The Place to Be Searched and the Items to Be Seized. 
Probable cause to search a residence requires some nexus between the premises and the alleged crime. See United States v. Jenkins, 901 F.2d 1075 , 1080-81 (11th Cir.1990). The Eleventh Circuit has found that a law enforcement agent's expectation, based on prior experience and the specific circumstances of the alleged crime, that evidence is likely to be found in a suspect's residence satisfies probable cause. United States v. Bradley, 644 F.3d 1213 , 1263-64 (11th Cir. 2011).
The search warrant affidavit established the requisite nexus between the alleged crime of interstate transportation of stolen property and the Subject Property. Businesses that sold the property fraudulently obtained from the GSA website and on which checks were drawn to pay for the property at issue used the Subject Property as their principal addresses. A computer located at the Subject Property was used in conjunction with the offering for sale and sale of the items fraudulently obtained from the GSA website.
The search warrant affidavit presented probable cause to believe that shipping records would be found at the Subject Property. As noted above, the companies used to purchase and sell the items fraudulently obtained from the GSA website used the address of the Subject Property. Further, facts were presented that a computer at the Subject Property was used in the offering for sale and sale of the items fraudulently obtained from the GSA website. These facts provided reason to believe that records of shipments of the items sold would be sent to the shipping company's address of record either in paper to [*8] the physical address of the Subject Property or electronically to the computer involved in the transaction.
In contrast, the search warrant affidavit provides no probable cause to believe that records of real estate transactions and purchases of precious metals would be found at the Subject Property.5 Nevertheless, these categories of items fall within the general authorization to search for fruits (proceeds) of the crime. The search warrant affidavit provided probable cause to believe that Husein Kermali obtained proceeds from the crime through sale of the stolen goods, as discussed in more detail below.
The search warrant inventory does not reflect that records of real estate transactions and records of purchases of precious metals were seized. Doc. No. 52-3. Because Husein Kermali has not established that any records of real estate transactions or records of purchases of precious metals were seized, there is nothing in these categories to suppress. See United States v. Brown, 374 F. App'x 927 , 936-37 (11th Cir. 2010) ("The remedy for overbrea[d]th in a warrant is severance but because none of the things seized were the result of [overbroad] language, severance is not warranted.").6 
Therefore, this assignment of error is also not well taken.
C. Items Seized Beyond the Scope of the Warrant. 
Husein Kermali asserts that the agents seized items not authorized by the warrant, specifically precious metals and firearms. Agent Weyrauch testified that firearms and the precious metals were seized under the search warrant authorization to seize proceeds of the criminal activity. The search warrant affidavit provided probable cause to believe that Husein Kermali acquired proceeds from the criminal activity by selling the stolen items. Courts have found that it is reasonable to find that a person engaged in ongoing criminal activity might keep fruits of his crime in a place easy to access, such as his residence. See, e.g., United States v. Kapordelis, 569 F.3d 1291 , 1310 (11th Cir. 2009).
As contemplated in Wuagneux, the searching agents used interviews of Husein Kermali and Sikander Kermali to identify what firearms and precious metals were likely to be proceeds of the criminal activity. When either Husein or Sikander Kermali identified items that were not purchased during the time of the alleged conspiracy, the identified items were not seized. The items left behind included 10 firearms, gift cards and cash. When items were identified as having been purchased during the time period of the alleged conspiracy, law enforcement items seized these items as proceeds of the alleged crime. Because Husein Kermali was not able to identify the type or amount of precious metals purchased during the alleged conspiracy, all of the precious metals were seized as proceeds or commingled with proceeds of the alleged crime.7 Thus, the evidence shows that the United States adequately investigated what were likely to be proceeds of the crime at the time of the search and seized only those items that it had probable cause to believe were proceeds or items so commingled [*9] with proceeds that the proceeds could not reasonably be separated from other items without difficulty.
For these reasons, the last assignment of error is also not well taken.
VI. RECOMMENDATION. 
For the reasons stated in the foregoing report, I respectfully recommend that the Court DENY the Motion to Suppress Evidence (Doc. No. 52).
Failure to file written objections to the proposed findings and recommendations contained in this report within fourteen (14) days from the date of its filing shall bar an aggrieved party from attacking the factual findings on appeal.
Respectfully recommended in Orlando, Florida on this 27th day of November, 2013.

The Court need not tarry long on defense counsel's arguments that coins are not precious metals. Doc. No. 52 at 7. The search warrant did not specifically authorize the seizure of precious metals; it authorized only seizure of documents reflecting the purchase, sale and the like of "any securities, certificates of deposit, or precious metals." Doc. No. 52-2 at 4. I will address below whether the seizure of precious metals (which I will define to include coins and other metals, such as cooper) was proper as fruits (proceeds) of the crime alleged.

fn 
2
Husein Kermali also argued that the information in the search warrant affidavit was stale. His lawyer withdrew this argument at the hearing. Doc. No. 64 at 3.

fn 
3
Follow-up investigation revealed that approximately $1,544,869.27 of precious metals were purchased during the time frame of the alleged conspiracy.  Id. at 18. Neither the search warrant affidavit nor the hearing testimony established law enforcement's assessment at the time of the execution of the search warrant of the amount of money that Husein Kermali allegedly received as proceeds of the conspiracy.

fn 
4
Even if this Court determines that the search warrant was overbroad or insufficiently particular in some respects, the search warrant did not authorize a wide-ranging, exploratory search. The search warrant affidavit presented more than conclusory assertions for consideration by the Magistrate Judge. There is no evidence that the agent who signed the affidavit or the agents who executed the search acted dishonestly or that the warrant was so overly broad on its fact that they could not have reasonably presumed it to be valid. Under these circumstances, the evidence seized should not be suppressed under the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule. See, e.g., Travers, 233 F.3d at 1331 ; United States v. Rubinstein, No. 09-20611-CR, [2010 BL 399981], 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 67896 , 2010 WL 2723186 , at * 10 (S.D. Fla. June 24, 2010); United States v. Lebowitz, 647 F. Supp. 2d 1336 , 1354-55 (N.D. Ga. 2009) (and cases cited therein).

fn 
5
The search warrant did not include a specific authorization to search for records of firearm purchases or for precious metals or firearms. The seizure of firearms and precious metals will be discussed in more detail below.

fn 
6
If items under these categories were seized, the good faith exception would also apply. See Kilgore, [2012 BL 430234], 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 154148 , 2012 WL 5334298 , at * 7-9.

fn 
7
During the hearing, Agent Weyrauch testified that the FBI has now determined that some of the precious metals seized were purchased before the time frame of the conspiracy. This may be a basis for Husein Kermali to file a motion for return of property under Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g) , but information learned by agents after the seizure of the property cannot be used to invalidate the seizure retroactively.

ORDER
THIS MATTER is before the Court on the following:
(1) Relator's Motion to Compel (Doc. 143) documents responsive to Relator's Third Request for Production and Defendants' response (Doc. 145);
(2) Defendants' Motion for Protective Order (Doc. 145) with respect to Relator's Third and Fourth Requests for Production and Relator's response (Doc. 148); and
(3) Relator's Cross-Motion to Compel Production (Doc. 148). Defendants' response to this Motion is not yet due.
A hearing on these matters was conducted on November 7, 2014.1 

By her Motion, Relator generally complains that Defendants continue to improperly seek to confine their discovery obligations to the documents produced to the Department of Justice and documents related to the two skilled nursing facilities where Relator worked (Marshall and Governor's Creek) and a limited number of other facilities, [*2] for a narrow period of time inconsistent with her allegations. She also urges that production of emails and communications is far to slow and at a pace incompatible with the Court's scheduling order. She contends that production should be made from all of the Defendants' skilled nursing facilities in Florida for the period from June 2005 to the present. Because Defendants' process of reviewing and producing relevant emails and communications is far too slow to meet the Court's deadlines, Relator urges that they be compelled to accept a more efficient search protocol or to produce all emails for her review subject to a confidentiality agreement and "clawback" provision. As to specifics, Relator cites Defendants' responses to Request Nos. 5-6, 9 and 10.2 (Doc. 143).
In response and by their Motion for Protective Order (Doc. 145), Defendants seek an Order limiting the temporal scope of discovery to the period from March 10, 2010, through January 25, 2012; facilities to those where Relator worked in 2011 (Marshall and Governor's Creek facilities); and residents to P.B., V.D., J.S., E.H., and W.S. as identified in Relator's complaint. Defendants also seek an Order stating they are not required to preserve material prior to March 10, 2010, and beyond January 25, 2012. Defendants argue the limitations sought are appropriate in light the allegations in Relator's Revised Second Amended Complaint ("RSAC") (Doc. 75), Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) considerations, and the applicable statute of limitations. Further, Defendants contend Relator has no proof of fraud dating back to 2005 and she seeks discovery to "the present," even though she has no credible information that any alleged fraud beyond her last date of employment. (Doc. 145).
In opposition, Relator argues that Defendants fail to provide good cause for issuance of a protective order. Relator urges that her allegations of fraud by management-level Defendants operating the facilities in Florida justify discovery at Defendants' facilities throughout Florida and a temporal scope much broader than that urged by Defendants. She claims that information discovered by the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ"), which dates back to 2008, suggests an earlier staring point is in order. Relator also claims that her demand for discovery from June 2005 is made consistent with the six-year statute of limitations. In any event, Relator urges Defendants now have reneged on providing even those matters previously agreed to, in particular, their production made to the DOJ, and their bald claims of burdensomeness are not demonstrated. (Doc. 148).
Upon consideration, Relator's Motion to Compel (Doc. 143) and Defendants' Motion for Protective Order (Doc. 145) are GRANTED in part and DENIED in part as set forth below. An examination of the RSAC demonstrates that Relator alleges Defendants operated 53 skilled nursing homes in the State of Florida3 and engaged in a scheme to defraud the United States and the State of Florida of Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE funds by routinely misrepresenting the medical condition and treatment actually provided to residents [*3] at the skilled nursing facilities. Allegations in the RSAC also reveal allegations that Defendants routinely misrepresented the identity and credentials of those completed and/or certified the claims. Relator alleges first hand knowledge of this conduct based on her employment between January 2011 and May 2011 at two of the LaVie facilities in North Florida. By her allegations, senior officers of LaVie Management Services, including the CFO and regional vice presidents, established Medicare and Medicaid budgets for each facility which set a targeted average per diem reimbursement rate for Medicare and/or Medicaid residents that was geared not to patient care but to maximizing profits at each facility. Regional reimbursement specialists were tasked to see that Medicare budgets were met or exceeded. They visited the facilities, and suggested ways to upcode resident's Minimum Data Set ("MDS") assessment so that the facility could achieve higher Resource Utilization Group ("RUG") levels. Nurses were offered cash bonuses if they exceeded the budgets. Such was accomplished by upcoding the RUG levels reported on a resident's MDS assessment. Similar tactics were taken to fraudulently increase RUG levels and thus reimbursement rates for TRICARE as well. Additionally, false statements concerning resident's ADL scores, billing for unnecessary rehabilitative therapy, and manipulating the reporting of therapy minutes were routinely used to enhance the profits at the facilities where Relator worked. For many residents, individual care plans did not exist and where they did, such were not timely prepared. These assorted activities were driven by cost reduction and profit motives and resulted in deficient levels of patient care. Moreover, to facilitate and conceal the fraudulent scheme, employees routinely misrepresented their identities on the MDS submitted to state and federal intermediaries. By the allegations, the fraudulent conduct was promoted by executive level employees at the regional level or above.
On the bases of Relator's allegations that the alleged fraud was driven by regional officers and management level employees at the companies managing the facilities, I find that discovery in this action may be directed to the activities at all the LaVie facilities within Florida4 and to any and all residents at such facilities for whom Defendants were billing for Medicare, TRICARE, and/or Medicaid reimbursement as such discovery relates to the allegedly false statements to state and federal authorities concerning residents' care plans, medical conditions, and their care and treatment at each facility; the establishment of Medicare, TRICARE and Medicaid budgets and the manner and means employed by Defendants to meet or exceed the budgets; the allegations of routine upcoding of resident's MDS assessments and/or RUG levels and any other means employed to fraudulently maximize Medicare, TRICARE and Medicaid reimbursements at these facilities, and all efforts [*4] taken to facilitate and conceal the scheme from state and federal authorities.
On the other hand, Defendants' objections concerning the temporal scope urged by the Relator appear well taken at this time. Consistent with Defendants' arguments, I conclude, at present, that the appropriate temporal scope of discovery should be January 1, 2008, through January 25, 2012.5 
Consistent herewith, Relator's Motion to Compel (Doc. 143) is GRANTED as to Request Numbers 5, 6, 9 and 10 as set forth in Relator's Third Request for Production. Documents and communications, in whatever format, including patient populations for each facility and identification of patients at each facility, including dates of care, treatment records, method of payments for care; care plans and MDS assessments for the same; all manner of billing and coding information for the pertinent residents; budgets, documents reflecting targeted reimbursement rates, and addressing any practice, policy and/or program for enhancing Medicare, Medicaid and/or TRICARE reimbursements, as well as scorecards or audits reflecting on the same; and annual cost reports shall be produced or otherwise made available for review within twenty-eight days (28) from the date of this Order. Emails within this order shall be made available on a rolling production basis to be completed within forty-five (45) days from the date of this Order.6 Production of ESI shall be made in the format requested by Relator unless such cannot be accomplished or a different format is otherwise agreed to.
To the extent not granted herein, the Relator's Motion to Compel (Doc. 143) and Defendants' Motion for Protective Order (Doc. 145) are DENIED.
The Court does not reach Relator's cross-motion to compel production but notes that some form of statistical sampling may be a reasonable next step to address issues going forward. The Court would again encourage counsel to confer on the same to arrive at an acceptable protocol.
Done and Ordered in Tampa, Florida, this 14th day of November 2014.

The discovery deadline in this case is May 29, 2015. Relator's expert disclosures are due on or before February 27, 2015, and Defendants' expert disclosures are due on or before March 27, 2015. (Docs. 124, 131).

Defendants' responses and objections are set forth at Doc. 143-2.

According to the allegations, in 2011 Sea Crest Health Care Management, LLC d/b/a LaVie Management Services of Florida, managed each of the 53 facilities and received compensation based on Medicare, TRICARE and Medicaid reimbursements received by the facilities. Salus Rehabilitation, LLC d/b/a LaVie Rehab, provided rehabilitative services at each of the facilities and is alleged to have knowingly participated in the submission of false statements and claims. Both entities and the facilities were owned by Genoa Health Care Group, LLC ("Genoa"). In September 2011, LaVie Care Centers, LLC d/b/a Consulate Health Care, acquired Genoa thereby acquiring ownership and control over LaVie Management Services and the LaVie facilities in Florida. CMC II, LLC a/k/a Consulate Management, a subsidiary of Consulate Health Care, entered into a facility management agreement with the LaVie facilities managed by LaVie Management. Since December 30, 2011, Consulate Management has exercised operational control over the LaVie facilities.

fn 
4
I disagree with Defendants that Rule 9(b) considerations limit discovery to the two LaVie facilities where Relator was employed. Relator's allegations state plausible claims of a statewide fraud that was ongoing at the time of her employment and continued for some period after she left. A fair reading of her allegations reasonably suggests that the conduct she observed was similarly occurring at each of the LaVie facilities under this management command.

fn 
5
These dates are consistent with the inquiry and litigation hold in response thereto to the ongoing DOJ investigation. Defendants themselves have previously suggested this as a more reasonable temporal scope. At present, Relator offers no basis to support the conclusion that discovery should extend back to June 2005 and it appears a reasonable conclusion that Defendants' allegedly illegal conduct would have ceased by the last date Defendants received civil investigative demands from the DOJ.

fn 
6
The pace of Defendants' review and production of email communications is woefully slow and inconsistent with their discovery obligations and this Court's Scheduling Order. Defense counsel is directed to confer with Relator's counsel and agree upon a word search or other protocol for reviewing emails which will enhance pertinent review and speed up disclosures. If Defendants are unable to meet this deadline, the Court will consider Relator's alternative proposal that the entirety of the emails be produced for her review subject to a confidentiality order and clawback provision.

BARRY S. SELTZER 
ORDER
THIS CAUSE has come before the Court upon [DE 217] Defendant's Motion to Compel, to Overrule Objections, and to Provide Complete and Responsive Answers to Interrogatories. The Court has reviewed the motion, the discovery requests and responses thereto, as well as Plaintiffs' Omnibus Response [DE 223] to several pending motions, including the present Motion to Compel.
Discovery in this case has been hard-fought and some background into the various discovery disputes is necessary. In February 2016, the Court held a hearing on disputes over discovery requests served by Defendant in December, 2015. At the time of that hearing, Defendant had not filed an answer, affirmative defenses or a counterclaim, and the Court expressly limited discovery to matters relevant to issues raised in Plaintiffs' Complaint. [DE 45]. Since that date, all pleadings have been filed, and certain of Plaintiffs' claims have been dismissed. All issues are now before the Court and the scope of discovery is governed under Rule 26(b)(1) , Federal Rules of Civil Procedure:
Scope in General. Unless otherwise limited by court order, the scope of discovery is as follows: Parties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party's claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case, considering the importance of the issues at stake in the action, the amount in controversy, the parties' relative access to relevant information, the parties' resources, the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues, and whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit. Information within this scope of discovery need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable.

Thus, the relevancy of Defendant's discovery requests will be determined according to the claims and defenses and the proportionality to the needs of the case.
The timing of discovery and of Defendant's motion raises additional issues. At issue are a second Request for Production that was served upon Plaintiffs on February 18, 20161, as well as a "Second" Request for Production and Interrogatories that were served upon Plaintiffs on July 22, 2016. Discovery in this case closed on August 23, 2016, although the [*2] District Judge extended discovery until August 31, 2016 [DE 175], to allow the parties to comply with a forthcoming order on a then-pending Motion to Compel.
The first issue before the Court is whether Defendant's Motion to Compel is timely. As it relates to the discovery served on July 22, 2016, the Motion to Compel was timely filed. However, as it relates to the Request to Produce served on February 18, 2016, the Motion to Compel is well beyond the 30-day time limitation imposed by the Local Rules. See Local Rule 26.1(g)(1) ("Failure to file a discovery motion within thirty (30) days, absent a showing of reasonable cause for a later filing, may constitute a waiver of the relief sought."). "This Rule was designed to prompt early resolution of discovery disputes and 'to ensure that discovery motions are filed when ripe and not held until shortly before the close [of] discovery or the eve of trial.'" Poe v. Carnival Corp., [2007 BL 219380], 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4627 , at *5 (S.D. Fla. Jan 23, 2007) (Torres, M.J.) (quoting 1998 Comments, S.D. Fla. L.R. 26.1 ); Manno v. Healthcare Revenue Recovery Group, LLC, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56272 , [2012 BL 428824], 2012 WL 1409532 , at *3 (S.D. Fla. Apr. 23, 2012) (Rosenbaum, M.J.) (Local Rule 26.1([g])(1) "sets forth a specific period within which discovery motions must be filed. Defining that period as 'thirty days' rather than . . . the less precise 'a reasonable time' reflects the judgment of the District that the filing period should not extend beyond thirty days. Thus, the Rule has the benefit of making clear precisely when discovery motions must be filed.").
The 30-day limitation period for discovery motions may, however, be extended when a party makes a reasonable showing for a later filing. Local Rule 26.1(g) . Defendant explains that the parties agreed amongst themselves to defer filing discovery motions until mediation was concluded [DE 217, p. 2, n. 2]. Although mediation occurred in July 2016, Defendant contends that Plaintiffs' counsel was not available to confer until August 31, 2016, and after that defense counsel was occupied drafting Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment; thus, the Motion to Compel better responses to the February 2016 discovery request was not filed until September 8, 2016. Id. 
Ordinarily, such a delay in filing a motion to compel would result in denial of the motion. Indeed, the Court previously denied a motion to compel filed by Defendant because the relief requested was outside the 30-day limitation period in Local Rule 26.1(g) . See, Order dated August 24, 2016 [DE 181]. However, Defendant's present motion seeks relief that is both timely and untimely under Local Rule 26.1(g) . To the extent that at least part of Defendant's motion is timely, the harm that Local Rule 26.1(g) attempts to remedy — last minute discovery motions filed on the eve of trial — cannot be avoided. In addition, Plaintiffs have not objected to those portions of the Motion to Compel that are untimely. Accordingly, the Court will address Defendant's Motion to Compel in its entirety.
Plaintiffs did file a response to the Motion to Compel in the form of an Omnibus Response to Objection to Rule 45, Rule to Show Cause and Motion to Compel [DE 223]. However, Plaintiffs' response is in reality, a request for an [*3] order re-opening discovery for a period of time to allow the parties to conduct ESI discovery in accordance with the protocols recommended by the Sedona conference. Such a request is properly addressed in the form of a motion seeking relief. Fed. R. Civ. P. 7(b) ("A request for a court order must be made by motion."). In all other respects, Plaintiffs have not addressed the merits of Defendant's Motion to Compel. Nevertheless, the Court has reviewed each of the objections raised by Plaintiffs as set forth in the Motion to Compel. The Court will address the discovery requests and objections in the manner grouped by Defendant.
1. Documents Related to Punitive Damages and the Existence of a Partnership.
Punitive damages are pled against Eric Romanow. Accordingly, discovery into financial records that would tend to show Eric Romanow's current net worth are relevant. See Porter v. Ogden, Newell & Welch, 241 F.3d 1334 (11th Cir. 2001); Black v. Kerzner Int'l Holdings, Ltd., et al., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 191060 , 2013 WL 11971270 , at * 3 (S.D. Fla. May 20, 2013)(only current financial documents are relevant to a claim for punitive damages). Financial discovery into the net worth of Plaintiff Rocket Real Estate LLC is not relevant to the issue of punitive damages and will not be ordered. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' objections are OVERRULED as follows: (1) Second Request for Production served February 18, 2016, numbers 1 and 7. (2) Second ("Fourth") Request to Produce served July 22, 2016, Nos. 1, 7 (tax year 2014 and 2015 only); 8 (2014 and 2015 only); 9 (2015 and 2016 only); 11, 12, 13, 14. As to any documents to which Plaintiffs claim a privilege and which are not included in the privilege log recently ordered [DE 222], Plaintiffs shall submit a proper and complete privilege log. Plaintiffs' objections to Requests to Produce Nos. 6 and 15 of the Second ("Fourth") Request for Production served July 22, 2016, are SUSTAINED as overly broad and not relevant or proportional to the needs of the case.
2. The Emails Purportedly Accessed by Ms. Maestres.
Plaintiffs' objections to Requests to Produce Nos. 12, 15, 32, 33, 34, and 35 from Defendant's Second Request served on February 18, 2016 are OVERRULED. As to any documents to which Plaintiffs claim a privilege and which are not included in the privilege log recently ordered [DE 222], Plaintiffs shall submit a proper and complete privilege log. Plaintiffs' objections to Requests to Produce Nos. 20, 21, 28, and 29 from Defendant's Second Request served on February 18, 2016 are SUSTAINED as overly broad and not relevant or proportional to the needs of the case. Plaintiffs' objections to Requests to Produce Nos. 1, 2, 4, and 5 from Defendant's Second (Fourth) Request for Production of Documents served July 22, 2016 are OVERRULED. As to any documents to which Plaintiffs claim a privilege and which are not included in the privilege log recently ordered [DE 222], Plaintiffs shall submit a proper and complete privilege log.
3. Request for Documents Relating to Statements Made by Witnesses 
Defendant's Third Request for Production of Documents Nos. 8, 9, and 10, served February 18, 2016, requested copies of documents relating to statements made by witnesses. Plaintiffs [*4] responded to Nos. 8 and 10 that "[a]ll responsive documents will be produced." As to No. 9, Plaintiffs objected on the grounds of attorney-client and work product privileges. According to Defendant, no documents responsive to these requests have been produced, and Plaintiffs do not argue to the contrary. Therefore, Defendant's Motion to Compel responses to the Third Request to Produce Nos. 8, 9, and 10 is GRANTED. As to any documents to which Plaintiffs claim a privilege, Plaintiffs shall submit a proper and complete privilege log.
4. Plaintiffs' Answers to Interrogatories 
Defendant seeks an order compelling better responses to Defendant's Second Set of Interrogatories served July 22, 2016, numbers 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. The Court agrees that Plaintiffs' answers as set forth in the motion are incomplete. Accordingly, the Motion to Compel better answers to interrogatory numbers 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 is GRANTED.
In light of the forgoing discussion, it is hereby
ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that [DE 217] Defendant's Motion to Compel, to Overrule the Objections, and to Provide Complete and Responsive Answers to Interrogatories is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART as set forth above. Plaintiffs will provide those matters ordered to be produced, including a privilege log, within ten (10) days from the date of this Order.
DONE AND ORDERED in Chambers, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, this 15th day of September, 2016.

ALICIA M. OTAZO-REYES 
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
THIS CAUSE came before the Court upon Plaintiff Quantum Capital, LLC's ("Plaintiff") Motion for Sanctions and Other Relief (hereafter, "Motion for Sanctions") [D.E. 138]. On December 23, 2015, the Court entered an Omnibus Order granting in part the Motion for Sanctions. See Omnibus Order [D.E. 206]. The Court referred the Motion for Sanctions to the undersigned, stating:
[T]he Court will refer [the Motion for Sanctions] to Magistrate Judge Otazo-Reyes to determine the correct monetary penalty to impose on Defendants. The penalty should take into account the following: (1) the amount of time and resources expended by Quantum in connection with its motion to compel; (2) the Special Master's fees paid by each party; (3) the attorney's fees and costs incurred in connection with the Motion for Sanctions; and (4) the amount of penalty that will be necessary to deter Defendants from such future conduct.
Id. at 39-40.

On December 28, 2015, the undersigned issued an order requiring Plaintiff to supplement the record with the amounts sought (together with supporting evidence) for penalty items (l)-(3) and a recommendation for penalty item (4); and allowing Defendants to respond. See Order [D.E. 210]. Thereafter, the undersigned granted Plaintiff's request to file a reply [D.E. 224].
After a thorough review of these submissions, the undersigned respectfully recommends that the Court impose upon Defendants a sanction penalty in the total amount of $161.911.98.
PLAINTIFF'S REQUEST
On January 7, 2016, Plaintiff filed its Supplement pursuant to the undersigned's Order [D.E. 215]. Plaintiff seeks $565,826.16 as the total sanctions penalty amount to be imposed on Defendants, which amount is composed of the following items:

Plaintiff appended to its request redacted billing statements from its counsel, Holland & Knight (hereafter, "H&K Billing Statements") [D.E. 215-2, 222-1, 215-4 through 215-10], Plaintiff also submitted the affidavit of Gerald B. Wald, Esq. ("Mr. Wald"), who reviewed the H&K Billing Statements (hereafter, "Wald Aff.") [D.E. 215-1]. According to Mr. Wald's computations, the H&K Billing Statements reflect a total of 456.4 hours, which, when divided into the fees amount of $176,869.00, yields a blended hourly rate of $387.53.  Id. at 7. Based on his review, Mr. Wald opined that the number of hours, the billing rates and the total amount of fees reflected in the H&K Billing Statements are reasonable. Id. 1 
The total amount of $6,896.40 in costs associated with Items # 1 & 3 is composed of the following items:

These costs items are reflected in the H&K Billing Statements for July 6, 2015 [D.E. 222-1 at 14]; August 17, 2015 [D.E. 215-4 at 16]; September 14, 2015 [D.E. 215-5 at 14]; October 19, 2015 [D.E. 215-6 at 15-16]; November 24, 2015 [D.E. 215-7 at 7]; and December 10, 2015 [D.E. 215-8 at 11]; and the October 2, 2015 Invoice of W. Romanishin [D.E. 215-10 at 2].
DEFENDANTS' OPPOSITION
On January 18, 2016, Defendants filed their response in opposition to Plaintiff's Supplement (hereafter, "Opposition") [D.E. 220], Initially, the undersigned notes that Defendants have conceded payment of Item # 2, Special Master's Fees, in the amount of $4,843.32.  Id. at 4. Defendants also submitted the affidavit of Neil P. Linden, Esq. ("Mr. Linden") setting forth his review of the H&K Billing Statements (hereafter, "Linden Aff") [D.E. 220-1], Relying on Mr. Linden's opinion, Defendants argue that the penalty amount to be imposed on them pursuant to the Court's Omnibus Order should be $76,158.95, inclusive of the Special Master's Fees.
With regard to hourly rates, Mr. Linden raised an issue regarding Plaintiff's potential seeking of reimbursement for fees not actually paid due to its acknowledgement that courtesy discounts had been afforded by counsel. See Linden Aff. [D.E. 220-1 at 7]. However, Plaintiff reaffirmed that the H&K Billing Statements were based on the fees that Plaintiff was actually obligated to pay. See Reply [D.E. 225 at 5 n.6]. Mr. Linden did not otherwise challenge the hourly rates reflected in the H&K Billing Statements.2 
With regard to number of hours, Mr. Linden annotated the H&K Billing Statements with his proposed exclusions of time entries based on the following objections: clerical work; block billing; duplicative billing; excessive billing; usual & ordinary activity (i.e., work unrelated to Motion to Compel and Motion for Sanctions); outside scope (same); and vague & ambiguous.3 Based on these exclusions, Mr. Linden opined that the reasonable amount of fees to be imposed as to Items # 1 & 3, Motion to Compel and Motion for Sanctions, should only be $70,971.50. See Linden Aff. [D.E. 220-1 at 62].
Mr. Linden also challenged the costs sought by Plaintiff and opined that only $344.13, representing travel and transcript [*3] costs, should be awarded. Id Mr. Linden opined that the Westlaw costs should not be recovered by Holland & Knight on the assumption that the firm likely has an unlimited service contract with Westlaw. Id at 8. Mr. Linden also indicated that, in his view, the translation services fell within the usual & ordinary activities of the firm. Finally, Mr. Linden detected the afore-mentioned $100 computational error.  Id. at 62.
Thus, in Mr. Linden's view, the total penalty amount that is reasonable as fees and costs for Items # 1 & 3 is $71,315.63. Id. Adding to this sum the undisputed amount of $4,843.32 for Item # 2 yields the total penalty amount proposed by Defendants of $76,158.95.
With regard to Item # 4, deterrence, Defendants challenge Plaintiff's proposed trebling of the fees and costs amount as excessive. See Opposition [D.E. 220 at 12-15]. They further contend that no additional penalty amount should be imposed for deterrence due to their expenditure of over $100,000 in contracting an ESI vendor for the production of documents and their payment of the Special Master's Fees.  Id. at 15. Defendants further argue that, should any deterrence penalty be imposed, it should be made payable to a charitable organization or a justice fund. Id. 
DISCUSSION
1. Fees
As noted above, the fees sought by Plaintiff in connection with the Motion to Compel and the Motion for Sanctions (Items # 1 & 3) is $176,869.00. This amount represents 456.4 hours, at a blended hourly rate of $387.53. Defendants do not challenge the hourly rates but ask that the Court reduce the hours as proposed by Mr. Linden for a total fee amount of $71,315.63. Upon a review of the record and based on her own experience and knowledge, the undersigned finds that 456.4 hours is an excessive amount of hours for Items # 1 & 3. See Norman v. Hous. Auth. of Montgomery, 836 F.2d 1292 , 1303 (11th Cir. 1988) ("The court . . . is itself an expert on the question and may consider its own knowledge and experience concerning reasonable and proper fees . . . ."). Moreover, the undersigned finds Mr. Linden's detailed analysis of the H&K Billing Statements reducing the amount of hours for Items # 1 & 3 helpful in determining the proper amount of fees for these items, except for the purported computational errors he detected resulting in a reduction of $3,820.50, which Plaintiff has satisfactorily explained. Therefore, the undersigned reduces the fees amount for Items # 1 & 3 to $75,136.13.4 
2. Costs
As noted above, Defendants object to the Westlaw and translation services items that Plaintiff claims as costs for Items # 1 & 3 by adopting Mr. Linden's opinion. The undersigned finds Mr. Linden's objections to these items to be speculative. Therefore, the undersigned will only reduce the requested costs amount by the $100 computational error to $6,796.40.
3. Deterrence
The undersigned finds Plaintiff's proposed trebling of the sum of Items # 1, 2 & 3 as the total sanctions penalty amount to be excessive. Given the Court's findings in the Omnibus Order and the circumstances of the case, the undersigned finds that a doubling of the fees amount for Items # 1 & 3 will act as a sufficient deterrent from similar future conduct [*4] by Defendants. With regard to Defendants' suggestion that the deterrence component be paid to a charitable organization or a justice fund, the undersigned respectfully defers to the Court's judgment.
4. Conclusion
Applying the foregoing adjustments yields the following sanctions penalty amounts:

In addition to the $176,869.00 in fees that Mr. Wald found reasonable, Plaintiff seeks to recover its estimated fees and costs for preparing the Supplement, including Mr. Wald's charges, in the amount of $15,000 to $25,000. See Supplement [D.E. 215 at 13 n. 10]. However, Plaintiff provided no documentary evidence to support recovery of any specific amount in this range.

Defendants did not challenge the attorney hourly rates reflected in the H&K Billing Statements; they only challenged the rates for paralegals and litigation support personnel. See Opposition [D.E. 220 at 6 n.3]. However, this challenge has been rendered moot by Defendants' adoption of Mr. Linden's calculations, which did not reduce these rates.

Mr. Linden noted computational errors in time entries for June 1 and 26, 2015 and reduced those entries by $3,820.50. See Linden Aff. [D.E. 220-1 at 20, 27], However, Plaintiff replied that these were only scrivener's errors, which had no effect on the bottom line but were nevertheless corrected by replacing D.E. 215-3 with D.E. 222-1. See Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to Correct Scrivener's Error [D.E. 222].

This figure represents Mr. Linden's recommended amount of $71,315.63 plus the $3,820.50 misdiagnosed error.

THOMAS B. McCOUN III, UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE.

THOMAS B. McCOUN III 
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
THIS MATTER is before the Court on a show cause hearing conducted on July 1, 2014. Defendant Albert Scipioni failed to appear. For the reasons stated below, it is recommended that default judgment as to liability be entered against Mr. Scipione.
A brief review of the procedural history is appropriate. Plaintiffs brought this civil conspiracy action in October 2013. (Doc. 1). Mr. Scipione, who is proceeding pro se, filed an answer to the Complaint that same month. (Doc. 12). Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint in February 2014, and a Second Amended Complaint in April 2014. Mr. Scipione answered neither.
Plaintiffs filed a Motion to Compel Discovery From Scipione on June 3, 2014. (Doc. 128). A status conference on discovery, including Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel Discovery From Scipione,1 was held on June 17, 2014. All parties, including Mr. Scipione, were duly noticed.2 (Doc. 134). Mr. Scipione, despite being noticed, failed to appear. Mr. Scipione also failed to respond to Plaintiffs' Motion.
Thereafter, by Order dated June 17, 2014, Mr. Scipione was ordered to appear before the Court on July 1, 2014, to show cause why he should not be held in contempt or otherwise sanctioned for failing to appear at the status conference, failing to respond to Plaintiffs' Motion, and failing to respond to Plaintiffs' request for production and produce documents.3 The Order further advised Mr. Scipione that failure to appear would result in the imposition of monetary sanctions and may result in a report recommending that entry of default judgment with respect to liability be entered against him. As indicated, Mr. Scipione failed to appear at the show cause hearing on July 1, 2014.
A district court has broad authority under Rule 37 to fashion appropriate sanctions for violation of discovery orders including the most severe sanctions of striking an answer and entering a default judgment against the disobedient party as the most severe sanction. Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2) ; see Malautea v. Suzuki Motor Co., 987 F.2d 1536 , 1542 (11th Cir. 1993); Gratton v. Great Am. Commc'ns, 178 F.3d 1373 , 1374 (11th Cir. 1999). Specifically, under Rule 37(b), if a party fails to obey a discovery order, a district court may impose sanctions to include: "prohibiting the disobedient party from supporting or opposing designated claims or defenses, or from introducing designated matters in evidence; striking pleadings in whole or in part; dismissing the action or proceeding [*2] in whole or in part; [or] rendering a default judgment against the disobedient party. . . ." Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(A) . However, the sanction of a default judgment requires a finding of willful or bad faith failure to obey a discovery order. Malautea, 987 F.2d at 1542 (citing Societe Internationale pour Participations Industrielles et Commerciales v. Rogers, 357 U.S. 197 , 212 , 78 S. Ct. 1087 , 2 L. Ed. 2d 1255 (1958)). Thus, a defendant's violation of a discovery order that results from negligence, a misunderstanding, or an inability to comply will not justify a Rule 37 default judgment or dismissal. Malautea, 987 F.2d at 1542 (collecting cases).
Here, Mr. Scipione has evidenced a complete lack of interest in participating in the defense of the claims asserted.4 He has ignored discovery requests propounded by Plaintiffs and has twice failed to appear at hearings noticed by this Court. It appears that at no point in the litigation has Mr. Scipione made any showing of good cause to justify his blatant failure to defend this action. His conduct can only be viewed as willful and in bad faith. Further, the Court can have no confidence that another Order of the Court directing his participation will necessarily result in the advancement of this cause.
While I am mindful that the severe sanction of a default judgment is appropriate only as a last resort when less drastic sanctions would not ensure compliance with the Court's Orders, see Navarro v. Cohan, 856 F.2d 141 , 142 (11th Cir. 1988), in this instance, I conclude that this case is one of the rare cases calling for the ultimate sanction of entry of default judgment against Mr. Scipione. To recommend otherwise would unnecessarily extend the financial burden on the Plaintiffs and inappropriately approve of Mr. Scipione's conduct. Accordingly, I RECOMMEND that default judgment as to liability be entered against Mr. Scipione and in favor of Plaintiffs.
Respectfully submitted this 2nd day of July 2014.

Wilson, Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton, LLP, Beverly Hills, CA; William P. Cassidy, Jr., Johnson & Cassidy, P.A., Tampa, FL.
JAMES D. WHITTEMORE, United States District Judge.

JAMES D. WHITTEMORE 
ORDER
BEFORE THE COURT is PODS' bill of costs (Dkt. 388). U-Haul filed a memorandum in opposition to most of the costs (Dkt. 407). In response, PODS filed an amended bill of costs and a memorandum in support thereof (Dkt. 415). Upon consideration, costs are taxed in PODS' favor of $82,727.12.
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d)(1) establishes a presumption that costs are awardable to the prevailing party. Chapman v. AI Transport, 229 F.3d 1012 , 1038 (11th Cir. 2000).1 However, a court may only tax costs that are authorized by statute. EEOC v. W & O, Inc., 213 F.3d 600 , 620 (11th Cir. 2000). Additionally, the costs must have been incurred for services that were necessarily obtained for use in the case.  Id. at 621 . Although it is within the district court's discretion to deny a full award of costs to the prevailing party, the court "must have and state a sound reason for doing so." Chapman, 229 F.3d at 1039 .
Many of the costs PODS seeks are not disputed by U-Haul and will be awarded. These are the filing fees for this case ($350, Dkt. 415 Ex. 1), fees for the service of summons and subpoena ($260, Id. at Ex. 2),2 fees for the trial transcript ($10,305.87, Id. at Ex. 3A), fees for the audio transcription of the Stuart Sing call ($282,  Id. at 3D), and fees for copies of admitted exhibits at trial ($264.75, Id. at Ex. 4).
The parties dispute four categories of costs: fees for deposition transcripts ( Id. at Ex. 3B and 3C), witness fees for trial ( Id. at Ex. 5A), witness fees for depositions ( Id. at Ex. SB), and fees for exemplification ( Id. at Ex. 6).
The fees for deposition transcripts are properly taxable, as PODS as made an adequate showing that they were "necessarily obtained" for use in the case. 28 U.S.C. § 1920 . (See Dkt. 416 ¶ 1). Further, costs of videotaping depositions are also recoverable, as U-Haul did not object to videotaping depositions at the appropriate time. Cardinale v. S. Homes of Polk Cnty., Inc., No. 8:06-cv-1295, [2008 BL 115818], 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41449 , 2008 WL2199273 , at *1 (M.D. Fla. May 27, 2008) (Whittemore, J.) (citing Morrison v. Reichold Chemicals, Inc., 97 F.3d 460 , 465 (11th Cir. 1996)). The videographer's fees are also taxable as a part of the cost of a videotaped deposition. Fantroy v. Publix Super Markets, Inc., No. 8:12-cv-1940-T-33EAJ, [2014 BL 28651], 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13083 , 2014 WL408426 , at *2-3 (M.D. Fla. Feb. 3, 2014). However, fees [*2] for video synchronization are not taxable. See Awwad v. Largo Med. Ctr., Inc., No. 8:11-cv-1638-T-24, [2013 BL 332693], 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 168894 , 2013 WL 6198856 , at *3 (M.D. Fla. Nov. 27, 2013) (collecting cases). Therefore, PODS' request for transcript fees will be awarded, with the exception of the video synchronization fees, for a total of $63,951.23 ($70,506.23 in Ex. 3B and 3C less the costs sought for video synchronization).
Witness fees for trial are generally taxable based on § 1920(3) . These fees are limited to witness payments of $40 per day, travel expenses, and a per diem for subsistence. The per diem is based on the amounts allowed by the General Services Administration ("GSA.") Witte Wolk BV v. Lead by Sales, LLC, No. 8:12-CV-2868-T-30AEP, [2015 BL 18072], 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7299 , 2015 WL 275812 , at *2 (M.D. Fla. Jan. 22, 2015). Here, the witness fees for trial, as well as the travel expenses and per diem allowances, of $4890 set out in Dkt. 415, Exhibit 5, are properly taxable and consistent with the statutory witness fee and the GSA limitations.3 Notwithstanding U-Haul's objections, it was reasonable for PODS to have certain expert witnesses present for days of trial during which they did not testify, and their witness fees and subsistence expenses are recoverable costs. Tampa Bay Water v. HDR Eng'g, Inc., No. 8:08-CV-2446-T-27TBM, [2012 BL 288702], 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157631 , 2012 WL 5387830 , at *20 (M.D. Fla. Nov. 2, 2012) (Whittemore, J.). PODS also seeks fees for its expert witnesses who attended depositions in Exhibit 5B. However, PODS has not provided any authority that these fees are taxable under § 1920 , and therefore, they will not be awarded. See Duckworth v. Whisenant, 97 F.3d 1393 , 1399 (11th Cir. 1996) (expert witness fees generally not taxable as costs).
Finally, PODS seeks $93,246.47 in fees for copying and exemplification. However, PODS has not carried its burden to demonstrate that most of these fees were "necessarily obtained" for use in this case. PODS seeks $50,346 in processing charges for electronically stored information, but there is no indication whether these costs are properly taxable. See generally Race Tires Am., Inc. v. Hoosier Racing Tire Corp., 674 F.3d 158 , 169-171 (3d Cir. 2012) (explaining Rule 54 limits taxing ESI charges as costs). PODS also seeks to recover the fees charged by its video and technical consultants, seemingly as costs of exemplification. This is at odds with binding precedent in the Eleventh Circuit, which states that exemplification "imports the legal meaning of an official transcript of a public record, authenticated as a true copy for use as evidence, and not the broader and common connotation that includes a showing or illustrating by example." Arcadian Fertilizer, L.P. v. MPW Indus. Servs., Inc., 249 F.3d 1293 , 1297 (11th Cir. 2001) (internal citation and quotation omitted) (reversing award of costs for videotape exhibits and computer animation used at trial). Therefore, only the amounts in Dkt. 415, Exhibit 6 which are clearly related to copies used at trial will be awarded as costs. (See Dkt. 415-2 at 61 (invoice of $2,423.27 based on printing and copying at trial)).
Accordingly, the Clerk is DIRECTED to tax costs against Defendant in the amount of $82,727.12.
DONE AND ORDERED this 21st day of August, 2015.

PODS argues in its memorandum in support of its amended bill of costs it is entitled to costs based on the Lanham Act, in addition to Fed. R. Civ. P. 54 . This argument will not be considered in the context of a bill of costs, and is more properly raised in conjunction with PODS' motion for attorneys' fees and expenses based on the Lanham Act and other statutes. (See Dkt. 389).

PODS' amended bill of costs reduces these costs to $260, as U-Haul argued was appropriate. (See Dkt. 415-1 at 9).

Exhibit 5A appears to be redundant with Exhibit 5 and the costs listed in Exhibit 5A will not be awarded.

THOMAS B. SMITH, United States Magistrate Judge.

THOMAS B. SMITH 
ORDER
This case comes before the Court without a hearing on the following motions:
• Motion of Defendant, Alejandro Rivera, to Compel Production of Mental Health Treatment, and Psychological Test Records from Dr. Dano Leli (Doc. 65); and
• Motion of Defendant, Alejandro Rivera, to Compel Production of Mental Health Treatment Records from Richard J. Stout, MS, NCC, LMHC (Doc. 66).

Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for redress for the alleged violation of his civil rights, malicious prosecution, false arrest, and civil conspiracy (Doc. 48). He alleges that as a result of these violations he "continues to suffer from nightmares, anxiety, and other psychological disorders." ( Id., ¶ 45). Plaintiff seeks, inter alia, damages for "substantial psychological harm, pain and suffering requiring constant counseling and medication." ( Id.). Based on these and other, similar allegations, Defendant Alejandro Rivera contends that Plaintiff has placed his mental and emotional status at issue (Doc. 65 at 3; Doc. 66 at 3).
Dr. Dano Leli, Ph.D, ABPP performed psychological tests and evaluations of Plaintiff over a period of three days and issued a report of his conclusions based on a battery of tests, records and interviews (Doc. 65 at 3). Richard J. Stout, MS, NCC, LMHC has evaluated and provided Plaintiff care and treatment for his mental health condition (Doc. 66 at 3). Plaintiff's attorneys anticipate calling Dr. Leli and Mr. Stout as witnesses to testify at trial concerning their client's condition and damages (Doc. 65 at 3; Doc. 66 at 3).
Counsel for Rivera caused subpoenas for the records of Plaintiff's evaluation, care and treatment to be served on Dr. Leli and Mr. Stout (Doc. 65, ¶ 3; Doc. 67-1; Doc. 66, ¶ 3; Doc. 68-1). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45 authorizes the issuance of a subpoena duces tecum for the production of documents (or other materials) from a nonparty. Bailey Indus., Inc. v. CLJP, Inc., No. 3:10-mc-64/MCR/EMT, 270 F.R.D. 662 , 666 (N.D. Fla. Sept. 30, 2010). "The subpoena 'should designate with reasonable particularity the documents, things and [ESI] that are to be produced by the party upon whom it is served.'" Id . (quoting 9A Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure: Civil 3d § 2457 (2008)). The Court has reviewed the subpoenas and finds [*2] that they sufficiently describe the information sought.
"A party or attorney responsible for issuing and serving a subpoena must take reasonable steps to avoid imposing undue burden or expense on a person subject to a subpoena." Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(d)(1) . The Court has no reason to think the subpoenas served on Dr. Leli and Mr. Stout are unduly burdensome.
A non-party upon whom a subpoena duces tecum is served may file a motion to quash or modify it if the subpoena: "(i) fails to allow a reasonable time to comply; (ii) requires a person to comply beyond the geographical limits specified in Rule 45(c) ; (iii) requires disclosure of privileged or other protected matter, if no exception or waiver applies; or (iv) subjects a person to undue burden." Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(d)(3)(A) . Dr. Leli and Mr. Stout failed to file motions to quash or modify the subpoenas.
"A person commanded to produce documents or tangible things ... may serve on the party or attorney designated in the subpoena a written objection to inspecting, copying, testing, or sampling any or all of the materials ...." Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(d)(2)(B) . "The objection must be served before the earlier of the time specified for compliance or 14 days after the subpoena is served." Id . The Court is unaware of Dr. Leli and Mr. Stout serving written objections to the subpoenas.
"A person withholding subpoenaed information under a claim that it is privileged or subject to protection as trial-preparation material must: (i) expressly make the claim; and (ii) describe the nature of the withheld documents, communications, or tangible things in a manner that, without revealing information itself privileged or protected, will enable the parties to assess the claim." Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(e)(2)(A) . Dr. Leli and Mr. Stout have not alleged in this Court that the information in their possession is privileged, and Plaintiff has not asserted a privilege with respect to the information Rivera seeks.
Dr. Leli's response to the subpoena consisted of a report outlining his conclusions; Mr. Stout did not produce any records (Doc. 65, ¶ 3; Doc. 66, ¶ 3). Now, Rivera seeks orders compelling both gentlemen to provide full, complete, and unedited copies of all their records that concern Plaintiff (Doc. 65 at 6; Doc. 66 at 6). Counsel for Plaintiff take no position with respect to these motions or the relief sought ( Id.).
Before filing these motions, counsel for Rivera conferred with Dr. Leli who "indicated that the records will not be produced without a court order." (Doc. 65, ¶ 4). The motion directed to Mr. Stout alleges that Mr. Stout "has further all requests that he comply with the subpoena for his records." (Doc. 66, ¶ 4). The Court does not know what to make of this averment. Each motion includes a certificate of service stating that a copy was served on the person who is the subject of the motion (Doc. 65 at 7; Doc. 66 at 7). Nobody has filed a paper in response to the motions and the time within to do so has expired.
In light of the claims Plaintiff has made and his intent to call Dr. Leli and Mr. Stout as witnesses at the trial, the Court finds that the records these gentlemen possess concerning Plaintiff's evaluation, care and treatment [*3] are relevant, material, and discoverable. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(2)(B) requires specific expert witness disclosures in a written report. These disclosures include "the facts or data considered by the witness in forming" his opinions. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(B)(ii) . "Under amended Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 , which took effect December 1, 1993, all parties and the court should possess full information well in advance of trial on any proposed expert testimony or demonstrative evidence." Robinson v. Missouri Pac. R.R., 16 F.3d 1083 , 1089 , n.6 (10th Cir. 1994). It can reasonably be assumed if Dr. Leli and Mr. Stout are called to testify, their opinions will be based, in whole or in part, on the information contained in their records. Therefore, counsel for Rivera is entitled to the subpoenaed records to evaluate and challenge the opinions to be offered by these witnesses.
Now, the motions to compel are GRANTED. Within 14 days from the date a copy of this Order is delivered to them, Dr. Leli and Mr. Stout shall produce to Rivera's attorney, complete, unedited copies of all their records that concern Plaintiff. It is the responsibility of counsel for Rivera to deliver a copy of this Order on Dr. Leli and Mr. Stout.
DONE and ORDERED in Orlando, Florida on August 8, 2016.

JOHN J. O'SULLIVAN, UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE.

JOHN J. O'SULLIVAN 
ORDER
This cause is before the Court upon the Joint Motion for Court Approval of Confidentiality Agreement and Protective Order Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c) and Entry of Fed. R. Evid. 502(d) Order, and the Court, being otherwise fully advised in the premises, it is,
ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the motion is GRANTED, and a protective order is ENTERED regarding the use and confidentiality of documents, information, and material produced in this litigation, as follows:
1. Designation of Information as "Confidential" 
Any Party1 to this lawsuit may designate as "Confidential" any information (regardless of form) produced or furnished in this case by the designating Party which the Party in good faith reasonably believes is not generally known to others, and which the designating Party (i) would not normally reveal to third parties except in confidence or has undertaken to maintain in confidence, (ii) believes in good faith is protected by a right to privacy under federal or state law, or any other applicable privilege or right related to confidentiality or privacy, or (iii) believes in good faith to constitute or contain trades secrets or other confidential research, development, or commercial information. Any Non-Party2 who produces information to any Party pursuant to a subpoena or other discovery request may avail themselves of the protections put in place by this Order by designating any such information as "Confidential." The Parties to this lawsuit shall treat any such designation by a Non-Party as if it were made by a Party pursuant to this Order.
2. Definition of Confidential Information 
As used in this Order, the term "Confidential Information" means information designated as "Confidential," whether the information is in writing, electronically stored or oral if recorded as part of a deposition or court proceeding.
3. Identification of Confidential Information 
Each Party or Non-Party shall designate to the Parties in this case which information is considered "Confidential" or the words ("Confidential" or "Confidential Information") shall be placed on or affixed to the first page of [*2] a document which contains "Confidential Information." In the case of an interrogatory response, the portion of the response which contains "Confidential Information" shall be designated. When information not initially designated as "Confidential" is designated later in writing, each Party shall make a reasonable effort to retrieve documents containing the later-designated "Confidential Information" and otherwise ensure that persons to whom the "Confidential Information" has been disclosed will treat the information as contemplated by the designation.
4. Protection of Confidentiality 
"Confidential Information," and any notes, summaries, memoranda, exhibits, or other documents which include or describe "Confidential Information," shall be retained by counsel for the Party to whom disclosure of the "Confidential Information" was made (the "Recipient Party") and, except as provided in this Order, shall not be disclosed to any person or used by counsel for any purpose other than for purposes of this case. Persons to whom access to "Confidential Information" is given pursuant to this Order shall keep such information, and any copies, abstracts, or summaries of such information, confidential and secure in accordance with the purposes and intent of this Order.
5. Access to Information Designated "Confidential" 
All transcripts of depositions, exhibits, answers to interrogatories, copies thereof, other documents, and all information otherwise obtained by counsel for any Party pursuant to discovery in this case, including, but not limited to documents or information obtained pursuant to a duly issued subpoena or other discovery request, which are designated Confidential, shall be retained by counsel and shall not be disclosed to others (except as set forth below), nor used by anyone other than for purposes of this case. Any such transcripts, exhibits, answers to interrogatories, copies thereof, other documents or information marked "Confidential" may be disclosed by counsel to (i) the lawyers charged with the responsibility for, or actively engaged in, the litigation of this case, as well as their employees and staff to whom it is reasonably necessary to disclose information for purposes of this case; (ii) any litigation assistant or paralegal employed by and assisting counsel, and stenographic, secretarial or clerical personnel employed by and assisting counsel in this case; (iii) any outside expert retained by the Recipient Party to assist that Party's counsel in the litigation of this case or who is expected to testify in this case; (iv) any litigation assistant, paralegal, stenographic, secretarial, or other personnel employed by an expert to assist the expert in this case; (v) any court reporter or typist recording or transcribing testimony; (vi) any court personnel, including stenographic, secretarial and clerical personnel; (vii) the Parties to this case and the officers and employees of the Parties whose assistance is necessary in the prosecution or defense of this case; and (viii) any Parties associated [*3] with an individual or entity retained by counsel for the purposes of assisting with the prosecution or defense of this case, including but not limited to, companies specializing in ESI retention/analysis, third-party document review companies, or other businesses offering services related to the litigation of this matter.
6.Acknowledgement of Confidentiality for Materials Produced By Subpoenaed Non Parties 
Before any transcripts of depositions, exhibits, answers to interrogatories, copies thereof, and/or other documents or information, which have been designated as Confidential by a subpoenaed Non-Party, may be disclosed to any person or entity described in items 5(iii) or 5(viii) of this Order, the person or entity to whom the Confidential information is to be disclosed shall sign and return to the Party seeking to engage their services an acknowledgment that states, substantially, as follows:
I,    , hereby acknowledge that I have received a copy of the Confidentiality Agreement and Protective Order, as docketed in the case of TracFone Wireless, Inc. v. Simply Wireless, Inc., et al, 1:15-cv-24565, pending before the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida (the "Order"). I agree and acknowledge that I have read the Order and understand the obligations and restrictions imposed upon me thereby, and I agree to be bound by its terms. I hereby submit to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida with respect to any action or proceeding arising out of, or in any way related to, the enforcement of the Order.
This paragraph shall only apply to materials produced by subpoenaed Non-Parties, which are designated Confidential.

7. Restriction on Use of Confidential Information 
The Parties shall not disclose or make use of any Confidential Information, except for purposes of this case. Such restrictions, however, shall not apply to information which (i) is public knowledge at or prior to disclosure in this case, (ii) becomes public knowledge as a result of publication by someone having right to do so, (iii) was previously known to the receiving Party, or (iv) is later disclosed to the receiving Party by someone having the right to do so.
If any Party intends to file with the Court any pleading, interrogatory answer, affidavit, motion, brief, or other paper containing, appending, summarizing, excerpting or otherwise embodying Confidential Information, the Party shall make reasonable efforts to provide the producing Party with reasonably sufficient notice under the circumstances to allow the producing Party to move to have the Confidential Information filed under seal in accordance with the applicable federal and local rules.
8. Voluntary Waiver 
At any time after any information, document, or deposition testimony is designated as "Confidential" under the terms of this Order, the designating Party or Non-Party may agree that the "Confidential Information" may be disclosed.3 
9. Confidential Material Subpoenaed or Ordered Produced in Other Litigation[*4] 
If any Party receives a subpoena, order, or other directive that compels a disclosure that would be otherwise prohibited by this Order, the receiving Party shall notify the designating Party, by email, promptly after receiving the subpoena, order or directive. Such notification must include a copy of the subpoena, order or directive. The purpose of imposing these duties is to afford the designating Party in this case an opportunity to try to protect any confidentiality interest it may have in the court or with the body from which the subpoena, order or directive was issued.
10. Disposition on Termination of this Case 
Within sixty (60) days after the final termination of this case and unless the Parties agree otherwise, upon written demand of the producing Party, each Party shall:
(a) assemble and make available for return to the designating Party all materials, documents, and transcripts containing "Confidential Information," including all copies thereof; or
(b) destroy all "Confidential Information."
Notwithstanding this provision, counsel are entitled to retain an archival copy of all pleadings, motion papers, transcripts, legal memoranda, correspondence or attorney work product (including exhibits, deposition exhibits, and trial exhibits), even if such material contains "Confidential Information." Any such archival copies that contain or constitute "Confidential Information" shall remain subject to the terms of this Order.
10. Provision to Seek Court Order 
This Order is without prejudice to the right of any interested Party to apply to the Court for an order permitting disclosure of any "CONFIDENTIAL" information, or to apply for an order modifying or limiting this Order in any respect.
It is further ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that an Order implementing Fed. R. Evid. 502(d) is ENTERED and provides as follows:
The Court begins by noting that Fed. R. Evid. 502(d) , "entitled 'Controlling Effect of a Court Order,' provides that '[a] federal court may order that the privilege or protection is not waived by disclosure connected with the litigation pending before the court-in which event the disclosure is also not a waiver in any other federal or state proceeding."' Great-West Life & Annuity Ins. Co. v. American Econ. Ins. Co., [2013 BL 254924], 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135750 , 2013 WL 5332410 , at *10 (D. Nev. Sept. 23, 2013) (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 502(d) ); Pragmatus AV, LLC v. Citrix Sys., Inc., [2012 BL 404995], 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 190856 , 2012 WL 12094515 , *10 (S.D. Fla. July 18, 2012) (ordering that "[i]nadvertent disclosure of information subject to the attorney client privilege, work-product immunity, or any other applicable privilege or immunity shall not constitute a waiver of such privilege(s).").
1. No Waiver by Disclosure 
This Order is entered pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 502(d) . Subject to the provisions of this Order, if a Party (the "Disclosing Party") discloses information in connection with the pending litigation that the Disclosing Party thereafter claims to be privileged or protected by the attorney-client privilege or work product protection ("Protected Information"), the disclosure of that Protected Information will not constitute or be deemed a waiver or forfeiture-in this or any other action-of any claim of privilege or work product protection that [*5] the Disclosing Party would otherwise be entitled to assert with respect to the Protected Information and its subject matter.
2. Notification Requirements; Best Efforts of Receiving Party 
A Disclosing Party must promptly notify the Party receiving the Protected Information ("the Receiving Party"), in writing, that it has disclosed that Protected Information without intending a waiver by the disclosure. Upon such notification, the Receiving Party must-unless it contests the claim of attorney-client privilege or work product protection in accordance with paragraph (c)-promptly (i) notify the Disclosing Party that it will make best efforts to identify and return, sequester or destroy (or in the case of electronically stored information, delete) the Protected Information and any reasonably accessible copies it has and (ii) provide a certification that it will cease further review, dissemination, and use of the Protected Information. Within five business days of receipt of the notification from the Receiving Party, the Disclosing Party must explain as specifically as possible why the Protected Information is privileged. For purposes of this Order, Protected Information that has been stored on a source of electronically stored information that is not reasonably accessible, such as backup storage media, is sequestered. If such data is retrieved, the Receiving Party must promptly take steps to delete or sequester the restored protected information.
3. Contesting Claim of Privilege or Work Product Protection 
If the Receiving Party contests the claim of attorney-client privilege or work product protection, the Receiving Party must-within five business days of receipt of the notice of disclosure-move the Court for an Order compelling disclosure of the information claimed as unprotected (a "Disclosure Motion"). The Disclosure Motion must be filed under seal and must not assert as a ground for compelling disclosure the fact or circumstances of the disclosure. Pending resolution of the Disclosure Motion, the Receiving Party must not use the challenged information in any way or disclose it to any person other than those required by law to be served with a copy of the sealed Disclosure Motion.
4. Stipulated Time Periods 
The Parties may stipulate to extend the time periods set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this Order.
5. Attorney's Ethical Responsibilities 
Nothing in this Order overrides any attorney's ethical responsibilities to refrain from examining or disclosing materials that the attorney knows or reasonably should know to be privileged and to inform the Disclosing Party that such materials have been produced.
6. Burden of Proving Privilege or Work-Product Protection 
The Disclosing Party retains the burden—upon challenge pursuant to paragraph (c)—of establishing the privileged or protected nature of the Protected Information.
7. In camera Review 
Nothing in this Order limits the right of any Party to petition the Court for an in camera review of the Protected Information.
8. Voluntary [*6] and Subject Matter Waiver 
This Order does not preclude a Party from voluntarily waiving the attorney-client privilege or work product protection. The provisions of Fed. R. Evid. 502(a) apply when the Disclosing Party uses or indicates that it may use information produced under this Order to support a claim or defense.
9. Rule 502(b)(2) 
The provisions Fed. R. Evid. 502(b)(2) are inapplicable to the production of Protected Information under this Order.
