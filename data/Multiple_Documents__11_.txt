BARRY S. SELTZER 
ORDER
THIS CAUSE has come before the Court upon [DE 217] Defendant's Motion to Compel, to Overrule Objections, and to Provide Complete and Responsive Answers to Interrogatories. The Court has reviewed the motion, the discovery requests and responses thereto, as well as Plaintiffs' Omnibus Response [DE 223] to several pending motions, including the present Motion to Compel.
Discovery in this case has been hard-fought and some background into the various discovery disputes is necessary. In February 2016, the Court held a hearing on disputes over discovery requests served by Defendant in December, 2015. At the time of that hearing, Defendant had not filed an answer, affirmative defenses or a counterclaim, and the Court expressly limited discovery to matters relevant to issues raised in Plaintiffs' Complaint. [DE 45]. Since that date, all pleadings have been filed, and certain of Plaintiffs' claims have been dismissed. All issues are now before the Court and the scope of discovery is governed under Rule 26(b)(1) , Federal Rules of Civil Procedure:
Scope in General. Unless otherwise limited by court order, the scope of discovery is as follows: Parties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party's claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case, considering the importance of the issues at stake in the action, the amount in controversy, the parties' relative access to relevant information, the parties' resources, the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues, and whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit. Information within this scope of discovery need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable.

Thus, the relevancy of Defendant's discovery requests will be determined according to the claims and defenses and the proportionality to the needs of the case.
The timing of discovery and of Defendant's motion raises additional issues. At issue are a second Request for Production that was served upon Plaintiffs on February 18, 20161, as well as a "Second" Request for Production and Interrogatories that were served upon Plaintiffs on July 22, 2016. Discovery in this case closed on August 23, 2016, although the [*2] District Judge extended discovery until August 31, 2016 [DE 175], to allow the parties to comply with a forthcoming order on a then-pending Motion to Compel.
The first issue before the Court is whether Defendant's Motion to Compel is timely. As it relates to the discovery served on July 22, 2016, the Motion to Compel was timely filed. However, as it relates to the Request to Produce served on February 18, 2016, the Motion to Compel is well beyond the 30-day time limitation imposed by the Local Rules. See Local Rule 26.1(g)(1) ("Failure to file a discovery motion within thirty (30) days, absent a showing of reasonable cause for a later filing, may constitute a waiver of the relief sought."). "This Rule was designed to prompt early resolution of discovery disputes and 'to ensure that discovery motions are filed when ripe and not held until shortly before the close [of] discovery or the eve of trial.'" Poe v. Carnival Corp., [2007 BL 219380], 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4627 , at *5 (S.D. Fla. Jan 23, 2007) (Torres, M.J.) (quoting 1998 Comments, S.D. Fla. L.R. 26.1 ); Manno v. Healthcare Revenue Recovery Group, LLC, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56272 , [2012 BL 428824], 2012 WL 1409532 , at *3 (S.D. Fla. Apr. 23, 2012) (Rosenbaum, M.J.) (Local Rule 26.1([g])(1) "sets forth a specific period within which discovery motions must be filed. Defining that period as 'thirty days' rather than . . . the less precise 'a reasonable time' reflects the judgment of the District that the filing period should not extend beyond thirty days. Thus, the Rule has the benefit of making clear precisely when discovery motions must be filed.").
The 30-day limitation period for discovery motions may, however, be extended when a party makes a reasonable showing for a later filing. Local Rule 26.1(g) . Defendant explains that the parties agreed amongst themselves to defer filing discovery motions until mediation was concluded [DE 217, p. 2, n. 2]. Although mediation occurred in July 2016, Defendant contends that Plaintiffs' counsel was not available to confer until August 31, 2016, and after that defense counsel was occupied drafting Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment; thus, the Motion to Compel better responses to the February 2016 discovery request was not filed until September 8, 2016. Id. 
Ordinarily, such a delay in filing a motion to compel would result in denial of the motion. Indeed, the Court previously denied a motion to compel filed by Defendant because the relief requested was outside the 30-day limitation period in Local Rule 26.1(g) . See, Order dated August 24, 2016 [DE 181]. However, Defendant's present motion seeks relief that is both timely and untimely under Local Rule 26.1(g) . To the extent that at least part of Defendant's motion is timely, the harm that Local Rule 26.1(g) attempts to remedy — last minute discovery motions filed on the eve of trial — cannot be avoided. In addition, Plaintiffs have not objected to those portions of the Motion to Compel that are untimely. Accordingly, the Court will address Defendant's Motion to Compel in its entirety.
Plaintiffs did file a response to the Motion to Compel in the form of an Omnibus Response to Objection to Rule 45, Rule to Show Cause and Motion to Compel [DE 223]. However, Plaintiffs' response is in reality, a request for an [*3] order re-opening discovery for a period of time to allow the parties to conduct ESI discovery in accordance with the protocols recommended by the Sedona conference. Such a request is properly addressed in the form of a motion seeking relief. Fed. R. Civ. P. 7(b) ("A request for a court order must be made by motion."). In all other respects, Plaintiffs have not addressed the merits of Defendant's Motion to Compel. Nevertheless, the Court has reviewed each of the objections raised by Plaintiffs as set forth in the Motion to Compel. The Court will address the discovery requests and objections in the manner grouped by Defendant.
1. Documents Related to Punitive Damages and the Existence of a Partnership.
Punitive damages are pled against Eric Romanow. Accordingly, discovery into financial records that would tend to show Eric Romanow's current net worth are relevant. See Porter v. Ogden, Newell & Welch, 241 F.3d 1334 (11th Cir. 2001); Black v. Kerzner Int'l Holdings, Ltd., et al., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 191060 , 2013 WL 11971270 , at * 3 (S.D. Fla. May 20, 2013)(only current financial documents are relevant to a claim for punitive damages). Financial discovery into the net worth of Plaintiff Rocket Real Estate LLC is not relevant to the issue of punitive damages and will not be ordered. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' objections are OVERRULED as follows: (1) Second Request for Production served February 18, 2016, numbers 1 and 7. (2) Second ("Fourth") Request to Produce served July 22, 2016, Nos. 1, 7 (tax year 2014 and 2015 only); 8 (2014 and 2015 only); 9 (2015 and 2016 only); 11, 12, 13, 14. As to any documents to which Plaintiffs claim a privilege and which are not included in the privilege log recently ordered [DE 222], Plaintiffs shall submit a proper and complete privilege log. Plaintiffs' objections to Requests to Produce Nos. 6 and 15 of the Second ("Fourth") Request for Production served July 22, 2016, are SUSTAINED as overly broad and not relevant or proportional to the needs of the case.
2. The Emails Purportedly Accessed by Ms. Maestres.
Plaintiffs' objections to Requests to Produce Nos. 12, 15, 32, 33, 34, and 35 from Defendant's Second Request served on February 18, 2016 are OVERRULED. As to any documents to which Plaintiffs claim a privilege and which are not included in the privilege log recently ordered [DE 222], Plaintiffs shall submit a proper and complete privilege log. Plaintiffs' objections to Requests to Produce Nos. 20, 21, 28, and 29 from Defendant's Second Request served on February 18, 2016 are SUSTAINED as overly broad and not relevant or proportional to the needs of the case. Plaintiffs' objections to Requests to Produce Nos. 1, 2, 4, and 5 from Defendant's Second (Fourth) Request for Production of Documents served July 22, 2016 are OVERRULED. As to any documents to which Plaintiffs claim a privilege and which are not included in the privilege log recently ordered [DE 222], Plaintiffs shall submit a proper and complete privilege log.
3. Request for Documents Relating to Statements Made by Witnesses 
Defendant's Third Request for Production of Documents Nos. 8, 9, and 10, served February 18, 2016, requested copies of documents relating to statements made by witnesses. Plaintiffs [*4] responded to Nos. 8 and 10 that "[a]ll responsive documents will be produced." As to No. 9, Plaintiffs objected on the grounds of attorney-client and work product privileges. According to Defendant, no documents responsive to these requests have been produced, and Plaintiffs do not argue to the contrary. Therefore, Defendant's Motion to Compel responses to the Third Request to Produce Nos. 8, 9, and 10 is GRANTED. As to any documents to which Plaintiffs claim a privilege, Plaintiffs shall submit a proper and complete privilege log.
4. Plaintiffs' Answers to Interrogatories 
Defendant seeks an order compelling better responses to Defendant's Second Set of Interrogatories served July 22, 2016, numbers 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. The Court agrees that Plaintiffs' answers as set forth in the motion are incomplete. Accordingly, the Motion to Compel better answers to interrogatory numbers 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 is GRANTED.
In light of the forgoing discussion, it is hereby
ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that [DE 217] Defendant's Motion to Compel, to Overrule the Objections, and to Provide Complete and Responsive Answers to Interrogatories is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART as set forth above. Plaintiffs will provide those matters ordered to be produced, including a privilege log, within ten (10) days from the date of this Order.
DONE AND ORDERED in Chambers, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, this 15th day of September, 2016.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF FLORIDA, ORLANDO DIVISION
  

DARLENE COLEMAN, Plaintiff, v. STARBUCKS, Defendant. 
  

Case No: 6:14-cv-527-Orl-22TBS 
May 22, 2015, Filed May 22, 2015, Decided 
Darlene Coleman, Plaintiff, Pro se, Orlando, FL. 
For Starbucks, Defendant: Jeffrey Bernard Jones, LEAD ATTORNEY, Jason Matthew Leo, Littler Mendelson, PC, Orlando, FL.
THOMAS B. SMITH, United States Magistrate Judge.

THOMAS B. SMITH 
ORDER
This matter comes before the Court on Defendant Starbucks Corporation's motion to compel pro se Plaintiff Darlene Coleman to attend her deposition and respond to interrogatories and requests for production, and for the imposition of sanctions (Doc. 42). The motion is due to be granted in part and denied in part.
Background 
Plaintiff filed this employment discrimination action against Defendant, and sought leave to proceed in forma pauperis (Docs. 1-2). The Court reviewed Plaintiff's complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e) , and dismissed it without prejudice, after finding that Plaintiff had not stated a claim for which relief could be granted (Doc. 8). Plaintiff's amended complaint met the same fate (Doc. 16). However, the Court found that Plaintiff's second amended complaint adequately stated a claim and allowed her to proceed in forma pauperis (Docs. 20-22). Defendant filed its answer and affirmative defenses on September 9, 2014 (Doc. 27).
On October 28, 2014, the parties met for their initial case management conference (Doc. 42 at 2; Doc. 43 at 2). During the meeting, Defendant served interrogatories and requests for production of documents on Plaintiff (Doc. 42 at 2; Doc. 43 at 2). Plainitff told Defendant's lawyer she "was having to move again[, and] it would take [her] some time to review" the discovery requests and that she didn't have a lot of what Defendant was requesting (Doc. 43 at 2). Defendant's lawyer told Plaintiff to "do the best you can," adding that he would also give her an extra two weeks, and "if you need more time let us know." ( Id.).
The Court's Case Management and Scheduling Order ("CMSO") established a deadline of November 10, 2014, for the parties to make their mandatory initial disclosures, and a deadline of May 1, 2015, to complete all discovery (Doc. 39). Plaintiff never furnished her initial disclosures in violation of Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1)(A) and the CMSO (Doc. 42 at 2).
On November 14, 2014, Plaintiff told Defendant's lawyer that she was "going through some hard times" and that the only way to reach her was through her P.O. Box (Doc. 43 at 2). In December 2014, she spoke with Defendant's lawyer about the manner in which she would produce documents ( Id.). The Court does not know whether Plaintiff's failure to serve her initial disclosures was discussed in either of these conversations, or in any subsequent communications between the parties.
On January 29, 2015, Plaintiff and Defense counsel spoke again regarding Defendant's interrogatories and requests for production (Doc. 43 at 3). During the conversation, Plaintiff complained that a lot of the information Defendant was requesting was "personal and didn't pertain to the case." ( Id.). Plaintiff also wondered why Defendant was asking her to provide [*2] her EEOC charge, right to sue letter, and personnel file since Defendant should already have that information ( Id.). On February 6, Plaintiff once again complained about Defendant's requests for documents she believed it already had ( Id.). Plaintiff told Defendant's lawyer that she was "not giving [Defendant] anything until they provide me with those documents" and that she "didn't feel right giving them my personal information that had nothing to do with this case." ( Id.).
On Thursday, April 16, 2015, Defendant's lawyer sent Plaintiff a letter and email inquiring about scheduling her deposition for the week of April 27 (Doc. 42-4; Doc. 42-5 at 1). Plaintiff denies receiving the email, but admits she got the letter, postmarked Friday, April 17, on the following Monday (Doc. 43 at 5). That Monday, April 20, Defendant's lawyer sent Plaintiff another email, which she did receive, attempting to schedule her deposition for the week of April 27 (Doc. 42-4; Doc. 43 at 5). Counsel for Defendant also sent Plaintiff a letter dated April 20, postmarked April 21, in which he sought to schedule her deposition (Doc. 42-5). In the letter, Defendant's lawyer said "[i]f I do not hear back from you, I will have no choice but to file a motion with the Court seeking sanctions and requesting that your case be dismissed." (Doc. 42-5). The emails and letters say nothing about Plaintiff's failure to serve her initial disclosures or responses to the interrogatories and document requests (Docs. 42-4, 42-5). Defendant's lawyer also attempted to contact Plaintiff by phone, but the number was disconnected (Doc. 42 at 2-3). On the day before the deadline to complete all discovery, Defendant filed its motion to compel (Doc. 42).
Discussion 
Plaintiff's Deposition 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26 states that "parties may obtain discovery regarding any non-privileged matter that is relevant to any party's claim or defense," unless a court order provides otherwise. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1) . This broad authorization reflects the intent of the discovery rules that trials in federal courts should be a search for the truth and should not be "carried on in the dark." Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495 , 501 , 67 S. Ct. 385 , 91 L. Ed. 451 (1947).
A party may take any other party's deposition without obtaining leave of court. Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(a) . To depose a person, whether or not that person is a party to the litigation, a party "must give reasonable written notice to every other party" stating "the time and place of the deposition and, if known, the deponent's address." Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(1) . Local Rule 3.02 requires a party to provide 14 days' notice to the deponent and all other parties prior to taking a deposition. If a party fails to appear for a properly noticed deposition, the court may impose sanctions. A motion for sanctions must contain a certification that the movant has in good faith conferred with the deponent in order to obtain the deponent's testimony without court action. Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(d)(1)(A)(i) .
Defendant waited until 15 days before the discovery deadline to begin attempting to reach Plaintiff to schedule her deposition. The parties disagree about whether Defendant actually emailed Plaintiff on April 16, but this is immaterial. Email [*3] is only a permissible method of serving litigation papers if the person to be served has consented in writing. Fed. R. Civ. P. 5(b)(2)(E) . Defendant has not produced Plaintiff's written consent to service by email and does not allege that Plaintiff has provided such consent. Even if Plaintiff had consented, she informed Defendant that she could only be reliably reached by U.S. mail. Consequently, Defendant could not rely on email as its sole means of communication with Plaintiff.
The letter postmarked April 17 was mailed to Plaintiff's post office box, per her instructions. Had it contained a notice of taking Plaintiff's deposition (it did not), then under Local Rule 3.02 , the earliest the deposition could have been scheduled was May 1, which was the discovery deadline. Plaintiff received the letter on Monday—the earliest date Defendant could reasonably expect her to receive it. Yet, the following day, Defendant sent a letter threatening Plaintiff with sanctions and thus impliedly accusing her of not cooperating with Defendant's efforts to schedule her deposition.
Defendant has never served a notice of taking Plaintiff's deposition. Indeed, after midnight on April 18, it could not do so since Local Rule 3.02 's notice requirement would have put the date of the deposition beyond the discovery deadline. Courts in this district do not require a party to serve a deposition notice as a prerequisite to serving a motion to compel, and will grant a motion to compel when a party refuses to schedule their deposition. But, Defendant has cited no case where a court sanctioned a deponent or ordered a deposition where the moving party waited until barely two weeks before the discovery deadline to ask about the deponent's availability. Accordingly, Defendant's motion to compel Plaintiff's deposition is DENIED.
Responses to Interrogatories and Requests for Production 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 33 allows a party to serve up to 25 interrogatories on an adversary. Fed. R. Civ. P. 33(a)(1) . The responding party must answer or object to the interrogatories within 30 days. Fed. R. Civ. P. 33(b)(2) . Objections not raised in a timely manner are waived. Fed. R. Civ. P. 33(b)(4) . "Each interrogatory must, to the extent it is not objected to, be answered separately and fully in writing under oath." Fed. R. Civ. P. 33(b)(3) .
Requests for production are governed by Rule 34 . Parties may serve requests "to produce and permit the requesting party or its representative to inspect, copy, test, or sample" documents, electronically stored information, or other 'tangible things' that are "in the responding party's possession, custody, or control." Fed. R. Civ. P. 34(a)(1) . Requests for production "(A) must describe with reasonable particularity each item or category of items to be inspected; (B) must specify a reasonable time, place, and manner for the inspection...; and (C) may specify the form or forms in which the electronically stored information is to be produced." Fed. R. Civ. P. 34(b)(1) . The recipient of a request for production has 30 days to respond. Fed. R. Civ. P. 34(b)(2)(A) . For each request, the responding party "must either state that inspection ... will be permitted [*4] as requested or state an objection to the request, including the reasons." Fed. R. Civ. P. 34(b)(2)(B) . Unlike Rule 33 , Rule 34 does not explicitly provide that untimely objections are waived, but most courts hold that they are. See, e.g., Wynmoor Community Council, Inc. v. QBE Ins. Corp., 280 F.R.D. 681 , 685 (S.D. Fla. Mar. 5, 2012).
When a party fails to answer interrogatories or produce documents in response to a proper request, the requesting party can move for an order compelling discovery responses. Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(3)(B)(iii) , (iv) . "[A]n evasive or incomplete disclosure, answer, or response" to a discovery request is "treated as a failure to disclose, answer, or respond." Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(4) .
Including the extra two weeks Defendant gave Plaintiff, her responses to the interrogatories and requests for production were due on December 11, 2014. Plaintiff has not answered the interrogatories, responded in writing to the requests to produce, or produced the requested documents. By failing to formally or properly respond, Plaintiff has waived her objections to Defendant's interrogatories and requests for production. Ordinarily, the Court would stop here and grant Defendant's motion but two issues require the Court's attention: the overbroad nature of Defendant's discovery requests and the timing of the motion to compel.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(g)(1) requires a party's attorney, or the party personally, if unrepresented, to sign every discovery request, response, objection, or disclosure. The signature represents the attorney or party's certification
that to the best of the person's knowledge, information, and belief formed after a reasonable inquiry:
(A) with respect to a disclosure, it is complete and correct as of the time it is made; and
(B) with respect to a discovery request, response, or objection, it is:
(i) consistent with these rules and warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law, or for establishing new law;
(ii) not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation; and
(iii) neither unreasonable nor unduly burdensome or expensive, considering the needs of the case, prior discovery in the case, the amount in controversy, and the importance of the issues at stake in the action.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(g)(1) . If a certification violates Rule 26(g)(1) "without substantial justification, the court, on motion or on its own, must impose an appropriate sanction on the signer, the party on whose behalf the signer was acting, or both." Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(g)(3) .

The Advisory Committee Note states that Rule 26(g) "imposes an affirmative duty to engage in pretrial discovery in a responsible manner that is consistent with the spirit and purposes of Rules 26 through 37 ." 97 F.R.D. 165 , 218 (1983). This provision "is designed to curb discovery abuse by explicitly encouraging the imposition of sanctions. The subdivision provides a deterrent to both excessive discovery and evasion by imposing a certification requirement that obliges each attorney to stop and think about the legitimacy of a discovery request, a response thereto, [*5] or an objection." Id . 
Unlike Fed. R. Civ. P. 11 , which imposes parallel requirements on pleadings, motions, and other papers filed with the court and threatens violators with sanctions, Rule 26(g) "has not been much used." 8A Wright, Miller & Marcus, Federal Practice & Procedure § 2052 (3d ed. 2010). This is surprising since discovery abuse is widely perceived to be one of the most expensive problems in modern litigation. Concern about overbroad discovery requests doubtless provided some of the motivation for the Rules Advisory Committee to propose making proportionality concerns "an express component of the scope of discovery" in the pending 2015 amendments to Rule 26 . If courts enforced Rule 26(g) more assertively, counsel and parties would likely take their obligation to tailor their discovery requests more seriously. Cf. Mancia v. Mayflower Textile Services Co., 253 F.R.D. 354 , 359 (D. Md. 2008) ("The failure to engage in discovery as required by Rule 26(g) is one reason why the cost of discovery is so widely criticized as being excessive—to the point of pricing litigants out of court.").
Defendant propounded 21 interrogatories, preceded by 7 1/2 pages of instructions and definitions,1 to Plaintiff. Some of the interrogatories are grossly overbroad or seek information with no conceivable relevance to the litigation. For example, interrogatory No. 2 asks Plaintiff to "[l]ist the name of any current spouse, if applicable, all former spouses, the date and place of each marriage, date and place of each divorce, along with the state, county, and case number of any divorce, separation, or related proceedings." (Doc. 42-1 at 10). The Court fails to see what relevance Plaintiff's marital history has to this lawsuit alleging racial discrimination and retaliation in employment.
Interrogatory number 14 asks Plaintiff to "[i]dentify (by manufacturer, type, model number and phone-number, as applicable) each and every electronic computing, communication or data storage device you have owned or leased from the past five years to present." (Doc. 42-1 at 22). The interrogatory explains that this includes but is not limited to "computers, tablets, cellular phones, iPhones, iPads, smartphones, personal digital assistants, USB devices, flash drives, thumb drives, DVD's, CD's, external hard drives, cameras, video recorders, or any other electronic computing, communication or data storage device." In an age where all media is digital, this is an expansive request indeed. It asks Plaintiff not only to identify every cell phone, computer, or tablet she has owned in the past five years, but also to itemize her CD and DVD collection (past and current) and list every CD and DVD she has borrowed from the local library. More than a few people would find compiling such a list to be a time consuming task, and it goes without saying that such an expansive request implicates privacy concerns. Yet, in propounding this interrogatory, Defendant made no effort to limit its scope to devices that contain or contained information related to the litigation, or, for that matter, to limit its scope in any other way. It is no wonder [*6] Plaintiff "didn't feel right giving [Defendant her] personal information that had nothing to do with this case." (Doc. 43 at 3).
Along the same lines, interrogatory number 13 asks for "all personal email addresses..., social networking accounts..., back-up or other on-line or third-party storage accounts..., or any other on-line sites, services, blogs, wikis, or message boards that you have used or maintained from the past five years to present (Doc. 42-1 at 21). The residual clause ("any other on-line sites, services, blogs, wikis, or message boards") is grossly overbroad if interpreted literally as a request for Plaintiff's internet browsing history for the past five years. In context, it could be interpreted more narrowly, to include only those "sites, services, blogs, wikis or message boards" which Plaintiff has maintained or provided information to. But, even with this narrower interpretation, the interrogatory is overbroad. Like Interrogatory number 14, its scope is not limited by subject matter and, given that many people provide information to a wide range of on-line sites and services (e.g., product reviews, comments or "likes" on news articles, taking online surveys or voting in online polls), its reach is expansive. It would have been interesting to see what happened if Plaintiff had copied interrogatories 13 and 14 and propounded them to Defendant.
Interrogatory number 16 asks Plaintiff whether she has "ever been a party or testified under oath in any legal proceeding," and if so, to "state in detail: the caption, court and docket number in the action; the name, telephone number and address of the parties in any such proceedings; the location the action was venued or the deposition or administrative proceeding was conducted; the name, telephone number and address of all attorneys representing the parties in any such legal proceedings; and the general subject matter and outcome of any such legal proceeding." This interrogatory would be unproblematic if it simply asked for caption, court name, and docket number, but it goes too far in asking Plaintiff to track down the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of all attorneys in an action in which she may not have even been a party. The discovery rules do not permit a party to drown his adversary in busywork.
Defendant's production requests are notable for their number and redundancy. In total, Defendant propounded 89 requests for production of documents in this simple, one-plaintiff-versus-one-defendant employment discrimination suit (Doc. 42-2). Of these, 56 seek "[a]ny documents which refer or relate to, support, or evidence, the allegation contained in" a particular numbered paragraph of the amended complaint. Request 67 asks for "[a]ny documents which refer or relate to, or evidence, any of the allegations of the Amended Complaint, including, but not limited to those documents Plaintiff intends to introduce into evidence or use in any manner during the course of this litigation, including trial." Apparently not satisfied that its first 60 requests were sufficient, Defendant then asked for, inter [*7] alia:
61. Any ... documents regarding any matter relating to Plaintiff's claims in this case."
67. Any documents which refer or relate to, or evidence any of the allegations of the Amended Complaint....
76. Print-outs, screen shots or other documents from any internet website, blog or social networking site to which Plaintiff has posted information or through which she has communicated, including but not limited to Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, MySpace and/or LinkedIn that reference Plaintiff's employment status, or relationship with Defendant during the time period spanning January 2012 to present.
86. To the extent not produced in response to Requests for Production Nos. 1-85 above, produce all ESI created, sent, received or stored using any of the email accounts, social networking accounts, professional networking sites, back-up or other on-line third-party storage accounts, or other on-line sites, services, blogs, wikis, or message boards, identified in response to Interrogatory No. 13, that in any way pertain to your allegations and claims in this lawsuit, any circumstances or activities relating to this lawsuit (barring any privileged or work-product material), your employment with Defendant, and your state of mind, emotions, mental health or mental condition,
87. To the extent not produced in response to Requests for Production Nos. 1-85 above, produce all electronically stored information created, sent, received or stored using any of the electronic computing, communication or storage devices identified in response to Interrogatory No. 14, including, but not limited to, word processing documents, emails, text messages, photographs, video recordings, and audio recordings, that in any way pertain to your allegations and claims in this lawsuit, any circumstances or activities relating to this lawsuit (barring any privileged or work-product material), your employment with Defendant, and your state of mind, emotions, mental health or mental condition.
89. Any documents which have not been produced in response to this request for production but which relate to, evidence or support your allegations in this litigation.
( Id.).

Defendant's approach to crafting document production requests imposes an unreasonable burden on Plaintiff. She is obliged to spend time reading through Defendant's bloated list of requests and then assert specific objections to each one that is objectionable. If and when motion practice ensues, this also imposes an unnecessary burden on the Court. Furthermore, Rule 34(b)(2)(E)(i) requires a party to either "organize and label" documents it produces "to correspond to the categories in" the document production requests, or produce the documents "as they are kept in the usual course of business." Propounding 89 mostly redundant document production requests in an ordinary employment discrimination suit effectively eliminates the first option.
The Court makes no express finding as to whether Defendant and its counsel violated Rule 26(g)(1) in this case. But, it is hard to imagine that an attorney who "stop[ped] [*8] and th[ought]" about whether these discovery requests were reasonable, "considering the needs of the case, ... the amount in controversy, and the importance of the issues at stake in the action," would have served them on his client's adversary. An attorney who propounds discovery requests without considering these factors cannot in good faith make the certification required by Rule 26(g)(1).
The timing of Defendant's motion to compel is also problematic. "While there is no local or federal rule setting a precise deadline for the filing of a motion to compel, it is clear that any such motion must be filed within a "reasonable" time period." Hoai Thanh v. Hien T. Ngo, Civ. No. PJM 11-1992, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66737 , [2013 BL 123805], 2013 WL 1976009 , at *1 (D. Md. May 10, 2013); see also Jordan v. City of Detroit, No. 11-cv-10153, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 90591 , [2012 BL 162094], 2012 WL 2526927 , at *4 n. 7 (E.D. Mich. July 29, 2012) (explaining that the fact that parties waited until the discovery deadline to bring disputes to the court's attention made their "requests for sanctions and protective orders less persuasive than they would have been if the issues had been timely brought to the court's attention"); Jackson v. Casio Phonemate, Inc., No. 98 C 6250 , 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27110 , 2001 WL 740518 , at *6 (N.D. Ill. June 26, 2001) (collecting cases). When parties fail to raise discovery disputes with the court in a timely manner, those disputes can fester into serious case management problems. Moreover, waiver principles apply in the discovery context just as they do in other aspects of litigation. See, e.g., AG Equipment Co. v. AIG Life Ins. Co., No. 07-CV-556-CVE-PJC, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 99915 , [2008 BL 273511], 2008 WL 5205192 , at *2 (N.D. Okla. Dec. 10, 2008) (citing Continental Industries, Inc. v. Integrated Logistics Solutions LLC, 211 F.R.D. 442 (N.D. Okla. 2002); Buttler v. Benson, 193 F.R.D. 664 , 666 (D. Colo. 2000)); Procaps S.A. v. Patheon, Inc., No. 12-24356-CIV, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 39167 , [2014 BL 416104], 2014 WL 1230737 , at *2 (S.D. Fla. Mar. 25, 2014) (discussing local rule requiring discovery motion to be filed within 30 days of "the occurrence of grounds for the motion").2 
This is not to say that a party should rush into court whenever an opposing party fails to respond to a discovery request. Indeed, Rule 37(a)(1) and Local Rule 3.01(g) require a party to confer in good faith in an effort to resolve discovery disputes before filing a motion to compel. When a court is too eager to apply waiver principles to discovery motions, it risks punishing parties for attempting to resolve discovery disputes in private. A party may have less patience for efforts to resolve a discovery dispute out of court if it knows the court will measure reasonableness of any delay from the date of the discovery violation. In determining whether Defendant brought this motion to compel in a reasonable time, the Court will measure Defendant's diligence from the point when the parties reached an obvious impasse and the need for a discovery motion became clear.
The parties conferred in late January and early February in an effort to resolve their dispute over Defendant's interrogatories and request for production of documents (Doc. 43 at 3). On February 6, Plaintiff told Defendant she was not furnishing any discovery to it until Defendant provided certain documents to her, and that she was concerned about giving Defendant her personal information that had nothing to do with the case. After [*9] this, the parties' discussions apparently stopped. At this point, Defendant knew, or at least should have known Plaintiff was not going to respond to its discovery requests absent an order compelling disclosure. Instead of promptly moving for an order to compel, Defendant did nothing for two months, finally filing its motion on the eve of the discovery deadline.
Due to the untimeliness of Defendant's motion, the overbreadth, and duplicative nature of its discovery requests, which are wholly out of proportion to the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, and the importance of the issues at stake, Defendant's motion to compel responses to its interrogatories and requests for production is DENIED.
Plaintiff's Initial Disclosures 
The CMSO set a November 10, 2014 deadline for Plaintiff to make her initial disclosures. The rule requires, with exceptions not applicable here, that Plaintiff provide the following information to the Defendant without awaiting any discovery request:
(i) the name and, if known, the address and telephone number of each individual likely to have discoverable information—along with the subjects of that information—that the disclosing party may use to support its claims or defenses, unless the use would be solely for impeachment;
(ii) a copy—or a description by category and location—of all documents, electronically stored information, and tangible things that the disclosing party has in its possession, custody, or control and may use to support its claims or defenses, unless the use would be solely for impeachment;
(iii) a computation of each category of damages claimed by the disclosing party—who must also make available for inspection and copying as under Rule 34 the documents or other evidentiary material, unless privileged or protected from disclosure, on which each computation is based, including materials bearing on the nature and extent of injuries suffered; and
(iv) for inspection and copying as under Rule 34 , any insurance agreement under which an insurance business may be liable to satisfy all or part of a possible judgment in the action or to indemnify or reimburse for payments made to satisfy the judgment.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1)(A) . Now, more than six months later, Plaintiff still has not complied. When a party fails to timely make initial disclosures, the court may enter an order compelling disclosure and impose appropriate sanctions. Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(3)(A) . The Court GRANTS Defendant's motion to compel Plaintiff to make her initial disclosures. Plaintiff shall make her initial disclosures as required by Rule 26(a)(1)(A) and the CMSO no later than June 8, 2015.

The definitions appear to have been slapped together haphazardly; number 11 is missing while number 14 appears twice, and there is a part "D" under definition number 2 but no "A," "B," or "C." (Doc. 42-1 at 4-7). Also, some of the definitions do not make any sense. For example, "data" is defined as "to state" certain information (e.g., date, author, custodian) about a document or oral communication (Doc. 42-1 at 7). "Data" is not a verb in common English, and Defendant does not use it like one.

Plaintiff does not raise the issue of waiver or the timing of Defendant's motion in her response. While it is true that "claims of waiver may themselves be waived," United States v. Dunkel, 927 F.2d 955 , 956 (7th Cir. 1991), the Court considers sua sponte the timeliness of Defendant's motion because Defendant's delay raises case management concerns.

WILLIAM P. DIMITROULEAS 
ORDER ADOPTING REPORT OF MAGISTRATE JUDGE
THIS CAUSE is before the Court upon the December 15, 2014, Report and Recommendation of Magistrate Judge Lurana S. Snow (the "Report") [DE 422]; Relators' Verified Motion and Incorporated Memorandum of Law for Award of Attorneys' Fees and Costs Under 31 U.S.C. § 3730(d)(2) (the "Motion") [DE 340]. The Court has conducted a de novo review of the Report [DE 422], Relator's Objections [DE 424], Defendant's Response [DE 425], Relators' Reply [DE 426], and the record herein. The Court is otherwise fully advised in the premises.
I. Background 
This is a False Claims Act ("FCA") action, brought by Relators against Defendant. Relators alleged that Defendant submitted upwards of 200,000 false claims. Ultimately, the Court entered judgment in favor of Relators following a bench trial. However, judgment was entered in the relatively small amount of $11,000, based on the Court's finding that Keiser did knowingly submit only two false claims. See [DE 318, 319].
On October 13, 2014, Relators filed the Verified Motion for Attorney's Fees and Expenses under 31 U.S.C. §3730(d)(2) , seeking $1,070,081.00 in attorney's fees and $75,954.35 in costs and expenses not taxable under 28 U.S.C. §1920 . [DE 340]. The parties filed several related briefs thereafter. See [DE 342, 343, 344, 354, 416]. On December 15, 2014, Magistrate Judge Lurana S. Snow issued the Report, recommending that [*2] the Motion [DE 340] be granted, in part, and that attorney's fees in the amount of $60,000 and expenses in the amount of $27,037.33 be awarded to Relators, for a total award of $87,037.33. Relators filed timely Objections to the Report on December 29, 2014, which are now fully briefed and ripe for review. [DE 424, 425, 426].
II. Standard of Review 
A party seeking to challenge the findings in a report and recommendation of a United States Magistrate Judge must file "written objections which shall specifically identify the portions of the proposed findings and recommendation to which objection is made and the specific basis for objection." Macort v. Prem, Inc., 208 F. App'x 781 , 783 (11th Cir. 2006) (quoting Heath v. Jones, 863 F.2d 815 , 822 (11th Cir. 1989)). "It is critical that the objection be sufficiently specific and not a general objection to the report." Macort, 208 F. App'x at 784 (citing Goney v. Clark, 749 F.2d 5 , 7 (3d Cir. 1984)). Defendant's assertion that a "clearly erroneous" standard of review applies is misplaced. If a party makes a timely and specific objection to a finding in the report and recommendation, the district court must conduct a de novo review of the portions of the report to which objection is made. Macort, 208 F. App'x at 783-84 ; see also 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1) . The district court may accept, reject, or modify in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the Magistrate Judge. Macort, 208 F. App'x at 784 ; 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1) . Accordingly, the Court has undertaken a de novo review of the record and Plaintiff's Objections to Magistrate Judge's Report and Recommendation.
III. Discussion 
Relators object to the amount of the fee award, the amount of expenses, and argue that the Defendant's expert affidavit should be stricken. The Court will address each of these objections in turn.
i. Amount of the Fee Award 
a. Application of Farrer to FCA cases 
Relators argue that Magistrate Judge Snow erroneously extended Farrer to the instant FCA action. In Farrer, the Supreme Court held that a plaintiff who obtains only nominal damages may have their attorney's fees award reduced or entirely dispensed with. Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103 , 113-116 , 113 S. Ct. 566 , 121 L. Ed. 2d 494 (1992). In the Report, Magistrate Judge Snow relies on United States v. Patrol Servs. for the proposition that Farrar applies to False Claims Act cases. In that case, the Eleventh Circuit, in an unpublished False Claims Act case, implicitly recognized that Supreme Court precedent establishing that the relative success of the result in civil rights cases bears on the amount of attorney's fees to be awarded. United States v. Patrol Servs., Inc., 202 F. App'x 357 , 359 (11th Cir. 2006) ("The district court may adjust the amount depending on a number of factors, including the quality of the result and representation of the litigation.") While the Eleventh Circuit did not specifically cite to Farrer, it cited to Hensley and Norman. In Hensley, which Farrer relied upon, the Supreme Court stated that in a civil rights case where "a plaintiff has achieved only partial or limited success, the product of hours reasonably expended on the litigation as a whole times a reasonable hourly rate may be an excessive amount." Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424 , 436 , 103 S. Ct. 1933 , 76 L. Ed. 2d 40 (1983). The Eleventh Circuit in Norman recognized and applied Hensley's principles in [*3] an analogous civil rights action. Norman v. Housing Auth. of the City of Montgomery, 836 F.2d 1292 , 1302 (11th Cir. 1988). Relators argue that Defendant, apart from the unpublished United States v. Patrol Servs. case, have not cited any other FCA cases that applied the reduction principle enumerated in Farrer. However, as Defendant aptly notes, Relators similarly have not cited to any authority that would indicate that the Court may not reduce an award of attorney's fees based on limited relative success in a False Claims Act case. It is true that an FCA case differs from an action for private damages in that the United States is the real party in interest. Yet, the Court notes that while encouraging whistle-blowing vindicating the public interest are important policy considerations, there are other factors at stake as well, including judicial economy. The Court finds that Magistrate Judge Snow appropriately applied Hensley and its progeny.
b. Ira Silverstein's Hourly Rate 
Relators argue that Magistrate Judge Snow erred in reducing Mr. Silverstein's hourly rate from $700.00 to $500.00. In support, Relators state that Mr. Silverstein has been approved at the hourly rate of $700.00 by the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and that Magistrate Judge Snow's reliance on a textbook purchase as an indicator of Mr. Silverstein's skill was misplaced. Finally, Relators argue that Farrer justifies, if anything, merely a total award reduction, rather than an hourly rate reduction.
The Court points out the Magistrate Judge Snow relied, at least in part, on her own "experience with rates charged by lawyers in this District of similar qualification and the very poor results achieved in this case." [DE 422 at 10]. Based on this Court's experience, the undersigned agrees with Magistrate Judge Snow's reduction regardless of the textbook purchase and Eastern District of Pennsylvania decision. Further, the Court may determine the reasonable hourly rate in its discretion—that is, "the prevailing market rate in the relevant legal community for similar services by lawyers of reasonably comparable skills, experience, and reputation." U.S. ex rel. Educ. Career Dev., Inc. v. Cent. Florida Reg'l Workforce Dev. Bd., Inc., No. 6:04CV93ORL19DABC, [2007 BL 25924], 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103934 , 2007 WL 1601747 , at *3 (M.D. Fla. June 1, 2007) (citing Gaines v. Dougherty County Board of Education, 775 F.2d 1565 , 1571 (11th Cir. 1985)).
c. Armando Ortiz's Hourly Rate 
Relators object to the reduction of Mr. Ortiz's hourly rate to $200.00, in light of another Southern District of Florida case, in which his hourly rate was approved at $250.00. Magistrate Judge Snow was not bound by the findings of other Southern District of Florida Courts in other cases, and neither is this Court. The Court overrules the objection and agrees with Magistrate Judge Snow that a reduction to $200.00 is appropriate.
d. Reduction of Attorney's Fees by 95% 
Relators argue that the across the board fee reduction imposed by Magistrate Judge Snow was far too drastic. This Court disagrees with Relators. Relators emphasize the importance of encouraging whistleblowers to proceed under the FCA and the non-monetary benefits unique [*4] to FCA litigation. Even taking these factors into account, given the disparity between the sought-after and actual results achieved by Relators in this case, the Court agrees with Magistrate Judge Snow's general fee reduction.
ii. Amount of Expenses 
The FCA allows for "reasonable expenses which the court finds to have been necessarily incurred." 31 U.S.C. § 3730(d)(2) . For the same reasons elaborated by Magistrate Judge Snow, this Court does not find that the ESI expenses, Trial Consultant expenses, or the attorney lodging, travel, and meal expenses were necessarily incurred.
iii. Defendant's Expert Affidavit 
Relators, in their initial motion to strike, argue that the Affidavit of D. David Keller contains a series of ad hominem attacks against Relators' Counsel, and is scandalous. While the Declaration is certainly unfavorable to Relators' Counsel, the Court does not find that it merits striking. In any event, this Court, following de novo review, has not based any of the foregoing findings entirely on Mr. Keller's affidavit.
IV. Conclusion 
For the foregoing reasons, it is ORDERED AND ADJUDGED as follows:
1. The Report [DE 422] is hereby ADOPTED and APPROVED;
2. Relators' Objections [DE 424] are OVERRULED;
3. Relators' Verified Motion and Incorporated Memorandum of Law for Award of Attorneys' Fees and Costs Under 31 U.S.C. § 3730(d)(2) [DE 340] is hereby GRANTED in part; and
4. Relators are awarded attorney's fees in the amount of 60,000.00 and expenses in the amount of $27,037.33, for a total award of $87,037.33.

ARCH INSURANCE COMPANY, a Missouri corporation, Plaintiff, v. UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, and AVENGE, INC., a Virginia corporation, Defendants. 

 


Case No.: 3:09-cv-395-RV-EMT 


July 9, 2013. 


ORDER AND MEMORANDUM OPINION 


Roger Vinson, Senior District Judge 


This aircraft insurance subrogation case was tried before me, without a jury. After close review and careful consideration of all the evidence admitted during the trial (consisting of testimony from 16 witnesses and approximately 50 exhibits), in addition to the pre and post-trial submissions and arguments of counsel, and being otherwise fully advised, I now make the following findings of fact and conclusions of law, as required by Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.[fn1]
I. FINDINGS OF FACT
This action arises out of a plane crash that occurred at approximately 11:35 p.m. central time on the evening of July 8, 2008, at the United States Air Force's ("USAF") Hurlburt Field, near Mary Esther, Florida. The crash (or mishap) involved a Pilatus PC-12 aircraft, registration No. N901TR ("Aircraft"), which had been leased to the United States by a private company for use as a training aircraft in the 319th Special Operations Squadron ("319th SOS"). The crash occurred while the Aircraft was in the process of executing a military landing maneuver known as a "Random Shallow Approach" and it apparently encountered wake turbulence generated by a much larger AC-130U aircraft that had been flying and landing on the same runway during the same time period.[fn2]
The plaintiff, Arch Insurance Company ("Arch"), paid for the damage to the Aircraft (which was declared a total loss), and was subrogated to the rights of the owner. Arch alleges that the defendants, Avenge, Inc. ("Avenge"), and the United States, share responsibility for the mishap. Before discussing the facts of the case in detail, it will be helpful to describe the impressive expertise and qualifications of the several expert witnesses who provided testimony and opinions in this case, as certain of those opinions will figure prominently in my findings of fact. 
Arch's Expert Witnesses 
Captain Robert "Hoot" Gibson. Captain Gibson joined the United States Navy after graduating from California Polytechnic State University in 1969, went through aviation officer candidate school, and spent a total of 27 years as a Naval Aviator. He flew in two fighter squadrons (an F-4 Phantom squadron and the Navy's first F-14 Tomcat squadron), flew a combat tour in Vietnam, and served as a Navy test pilot. In 1978, he joined NASA, became NASA's Chief Astronaut, and made five trips to space aboard the Space Shuttle (one as co-pilot, the other four as mission commander). He then worked in the civilian aviation field for a number of years as a pilot (first as co-pilot, then as captain) for Southwest Airlines. Captain Gibson is an accomplished and experienced pilot with more than 14,000 flight hours. He has flown a lot of different aircraft, including experimental aircraft, racing aircraft, [*2] and the Space Shuttle (however, he has never flown a PC-12). Dr. Gibson was retained by the plaintiff to offer testimony on the standard of care. 
Dr. Robert C. Winn. Dr. Winn is a mechanical and aeronautical engineer. He received his Bachelor's degree from the University of Illinois in 1968, his Master's degree from the same university in 1969, and his Doctorate degree from Colorado State University in 1982, all in Mechanical Engineering. He has spent more than 15 years teaching aeronautical and mechanical engineering at the USAF Academy and Colorado Technical University. Dr. Winn was a USAF pilot for 22 years, after which he became a consulting engineer with Engineering Systems, Inc. (ESI). ESI provides professional engineering services and wide range of technical support and accident reconstruction analyses. Dr. Winn has published over 70 technical papers, reports, and articles on a wide-range of issues, including aviation accident reconstruction. He was retained to provide reconstruction analysis of the events leading up to the mishap, interpret the radar data, and ultimately offer his opinion on causation. 
Dr. Elizabeth Austin. Dr. Austin is a forensic consulting meteorologist. She received her Bachelor's degree in Atmospheric Science from UCLA in 1987, her Master's degree in Atmospheric Physics from the University of Nevada, Reno, in 1991, and her Doctorate in Physics from that university in 1994. She is a board certified consulting meteorologist — which is the only certification in this country for consulting meteorologists — and she has conducted over 700 meteorological investigations for legal matters. She was hired by the plaintiff to offer analysis of the weather and atmospheric conditions on the night of the crash. 
Dr. James Hallock. Dr. Hallock is a physicist. He received each of his three degrees (Bachelor's, Master's, and Ph.D) in Physics from MIT. After working as a staff and laboratory physicist at MIT, he went to work for NASA, and, thereafter, the Department of Transportation. He retired from the DOT in 2008 and began a private consulting firm. His primary area of expertise is aircraft wake vortices, and he has published numerous articles and technical papers on the subject. Dr. Hallock was retained by Arch specifically to rebut the testimony and opinions by the expert witness for Avenge, Robert Rivers. 
Avenge's Expert Witness 
Robert Rivers. Rivers graduated from the University of North Carolina with a Bachelor's in Mathematics, and from the University of Virginia with a Master's in Aerospace Engineering. He was also a Naval Aviator and a commercial pilot, and a NASA test pilot for 22 years. In total, he has over 13,000 flight hours. In addition, he has received multiple awards and authored or co-authored more than 25 papers on piloting-related issues. While at NASA, Rivers was the chief project pilot on its wake vortex testing program. He has studied wake vortices for many years, and, in order to better understand them, he helped design and construct a special research aircraft capable of penetrating wake vortices [*3] and recording information about them. This research aircraft (OV-10) is a turboprop airplane that is about the same weight and has similar handling characteristics as the PC-12. For his research, Rivers flew the aircraft and penetrated several thousand wakes generated by different types of larger aircraft (from 50 feet all the way to about 10,000 feet), including "well over a thousand penetrations behind a C-130" [Tr. 850]. Rivers was retained by Avenge to offer testimony on the cause of the mishap. 
United States' Expert Witnesses 
Dr. Kenneth L. Orloff. Dr. Orloff is an aviation accident reconstructionist. He holds a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Physics, and a Doctorate in Mechanical Engineering from the University of California. Shortly after receiving his Ph.D., Dr. Orloff went to work as a research scientist for NASA, where he spent the first five (of 13 total) years in its Wake Turbulence Research and Alleviation Group studying wake flow fields and vortex decay characteristics, trying to find ways to alleviate the wake turbulence hazard. He has taught physics, engineering, aerodynamics, and aeronautics at the university level; published articles and papers on aviation-related issues; been qualified as an expert in many prior cases; and testified before the United States Congress. Dr. Orloff is also a pilot (and certified flight instructor) and has accumulated more than 8000 flight hours. He was retained by the United States to interpret the radar data and provide testimony on causation. 
Joseph Lintzenich. Lintzenich is a licensed Airline Transport Pilot with over 20,000 hours of national and international flying experience. He has flown various types and sizes of aircraft, from a small single-engine to the Boeing 747-400. He, in conjunction with others, has spent about 12 years working in the area of wake vortices to understand their mechanics and devise flight standards and procedures so that pilots could better avoid wake turbulence hazards. He has authored papers and articles; made presentations before various aviation groups; and been published by the FAA in the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM). He is currently President of Airways and Airports Consultants, Inc., an aviation consulting firm that provides, inter alia, aviation accident reconstruction. He was retained by the United States to evaluate the circumstances surrounding the mishap from the pilot's perspective and offer an opinion on causation. 
After reviewing all the evidence provided by these expert witnesses, along with the evidence from the fact witnesses, I will now make my findings of fact. 
The Aircraft and the 319th SOS at Hurlburt Field 
1) The PC-12 is a relatively small, high performance, single-turboprop-engine, fixed-wing civilian airplane. The landing weight of the plane that crashed was estimated to be 7,500 lbs. The pilot and co-pilot seats are positioned in the front of the plane (on the right and left). The Aircraft was configured with six or seven passenger seats in the back. 
2) The U-28 is the military version of the PC-12. It has a different [*4] global positioning system (GPS), a tactical and secure-capable radio, and various other military features, but otherwise the two aircraft are "basically the same" [Tr. 70-71; see also Tr. 620]. While the U-28 was the version flown in combat areas, the USAF had an ongoing conversion program in which the PC-12s were converted to U-28s. Both versions of the aircraft were flown in the 319th SOS at Hurlburt Field. Notably, for purposes of this case, the PC-12 uses VHF communication radios and the U-28 uses the military's UHF communication radio. 
3) In 2008, the 319th SOS was an operational squadron in the midst of rapid growth.[fn3] At any given time, approximately 40% of the squadron pilots were deployed to combat theaters on a rotating basis. Colonel Jerry Wayne Haynes (the commander of the squadron) testified that the pilots were deploying 60 to 90 days, after which the pilots would return home for 60 to 90 days; "so if you were home, you were always training for your next deployment" [Tr. 644]. One of the missions of the 319th SOS during this period of time was to train and prepare pilots for combat in the U-28. However, because of the operational demands of the ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the 319th SOS had limited training resources. Indeed, shortly after the wars began, "all the aircraft and over half of the pilots immediately went to war" [see Tr. 632]. Consequently, the USAF started to use (and rely upon) contract suppliers of instructor pilots and aircraft to keep the squadron fully staffed and operational. 
4) In July 2007, Avenge contracted with the United States to provide instructor pilots for the 319th SOS [Ex. 109]. These pilots were tasked, inter alia, with teaching portions of the USAF syllabus in the PC-12. The contract purported to establish an independent contractor relationship. It specifically stated that the parties "recognize and agree that no employer-employee relationships exist or will exist under the contract between the Government and Contractor and/or between the Government and the Contractor's employees" [see Ex. 109 at § H-0009]. The contract further provided that the United States "shall not be held responsible for damages to property . . . who [sic] might occur without fault on the part of the Government as a result of, or incident to, performance of the contractor" [see id., at § H-0006]. 
5) Avenge provided the USAF with five or six instructor pilots under the contract. These pilots were "high quality" and "first rate"; had "great experience"; and "did an exceptional job" at Hurlburt Field [Tr. 814-15]. Because a large number of the USAF pilots during this time were following a regular operational deployment schedule in Iraq or Afghanistan — which resulted in "long breaks" in their training and thus necessitated that they spend a lot of their flying time getting re-qualified or maintaining currency — the Avenge pilots flew most of the training and re-qualifying flights and quickly became the primary PC-12 instructors in the 319th SOS [Tr. 803-04; 816-17]. In fact, within six months the Avenge pilots had more experience in the PC-12 than the USAF pilots, and they "were [*5] well above [those] instructors" in terms of "expertise" [see Tr. 817]. Due to the growing disparity in instructor flying experience between the Avenge pilots and the USAF pilots, the Air Force instructor pilots were eventually "restricted" from flying and instructing in the PC-12 because, as Colonel Anderson testified at trial, "honestly, [they] didn't have the expertise to do that" [see Tr. 816-17]. 
6) One of the experienced and "highly regarded" Avenge instructor pilots was Robert Mason "Tripp" Howard. After graduating from the Air Force Academy in 1987, Howard went to Air Force pilot training, joined the special operations unit at Hurlburt Field, and flew a number of aircraft during his military service, including the MC-130H Combat Talon II; the Antonov 26 and 32; the DC-3; and the CASA 212. He was also an instructor pilot for these aircraft, and he separated from the military with 15 years instructor pilot experience and logged approximately 6,000 flight hours. After separating from the USAF, he went to work for Avenge, where he became a certified instructor pilot for the PC-12 [Tr. 269-79; see also Doc. 155 at 26 ¶ 14]. 
7) While Avenge was supplying the USAF with instructor pilots for the PC-12, Sierra Nevada Corporation ("SNC") was supplying the USAF with the PC-12s themselves, under a contract. This contract, along with subsequent Delivery Orders, provided that SNC would carry insurance for all the leased aircraft and, furthermore, by incorporation of a specific Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation, that the government assumed the risk of damage to, or loss or destruction of, the aircraft unless it was "covered by insurance." See 48 C.F.R. § 252.228-7001(e). 
8) In June 2008, one of the SNC PC-12s was damaged during a landing. SNC found and leased a replacement PC-12 — the Aircraft — from its owner, the Northwest Flying Tigers, LLC, and SNC sub-leased it to the USAF as a substitute airplane. The Aircraft was included in SNC's blanket coverage under an insurance policy issued by Arch, with coverage for physical loss and damage with an agreed hull value of $3.5 million and aircraft liability. The Aircraft was thereafter assigned to the 319th SOS at Hurlburt Field. 
9) During the time relevant here, training at the 319th SOS consisted of, inter alia, tactical piloting maneuvers that involve avoiding various combat threats, including what is generally known as the "Random Shallow Approach." This is a maneuver in which the aircraft approaches the airfield from a random direction at a high rate of speed (ending up on a short downwind leg of 200 knots airspeed at an altitude of 500 feet above ground level) in order to limit the time that the airplane is an exposed target, thereby reducing the possibility of encountering threats from the ground (i.e., being shot). 

Wake Vortices and Turbulence [fn4]
10) Wakes are usually invisible and generally believed to move downward and dissipate over time. However, in tests, they can sometimes behave randomly, capriciously, and follow no set path [see, e.g., Ex. 70 at 3]. Therefore, while wake vortices may indeed roll off the wingtips and descend as they gradually dissipate, depending [*6] on numerous complex atmospheric and other conditions, they may also remain level or, in fact, rise behind the generating aircraft [see id.; accord Tr. 859]. 
11) The diameter of the "core" of the vortex is initially about 1% of the distance between the two vortices — which would be approximately 75% of the wingtip-to-wingtip distance. So, for a C-130, the core would initially be about 1.0 to 1.5 feet in diameter, and gradually expanding. 
12) When a smaller aircraft is following a larger aircraft during a take-off or landing, the wingtip vortex generated by the larger (leading) aircraft could bring about wake turbulence with the potential to impact the smaller (following) aircraft [e.g., Ex. 55 at 4; Ex. 65 at 2]. In and of itself, however, this is not necessarily a dangerous condition that will cause a crash. The uplifting effect of both vortices tends to push the following aircraft out of the wake vortex as it approaches from either side. Thus, hitting a vortex in the precise manner necessary to roll the plane and endanger it is very difficult [Ex. 70 at 4-5]. For that to happen, there must be enough time for the vortex to grow large enough in diameter to produce a "couple" (that is, forces on each wingtip of opposite direction) with a sufficiently large moment arm based on the strength of the wake to overcome the opposing aileron-induced rolling moment and the aircraft must hit the vortex in the precisely the right spot (core) [see id.], which is actually "very hard" to do [Tr. 859]. To be sure, the vast majority of wake encounters "are completely benign" [see Tr. 875], and a wake vortex accident is a rare occurrence.[fn5]
13) Nevertheless, because of the potential for danger, pilots are trained to try and avoid wake turbulence. The standard way to do so — and the one most at issue in this litigation — is to "fly high and land long," which means fly above the preceding aircraft's flight path and land beyond that aircraft's touch down point on the runway. For example, the FAA's Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM) states: "Pilots should fly at or above the preceding aircraft's flight path, altering course as necessary to avoid the area behind and below the generating aircraft" [Ex. 70 at 3 (quoting AIM at 7-3-2)]. In addition, the USAF uses various FAA Advisory Circulars for training and information purposes [Tr. 109-110], and Advisory Circular No. 90-23 provides that: "When landing behind a larger aircraft [on the same runway] stay at or above the larger aircraft's final approach flight path. Note touchdown point —land beyond it." [Ex. 20 at 8]. And the Concept of Operations (CONOPS), which is "required reading" material for USAF pilots undergoing training in the 319th SOS [see Tr. 105, 180], provides that when landing behind a larger aircraft on the same runway, the pilot should: "Stay at or above the larger aircraft's final approach flight path. Land beyond its touchdown point" [Ex. 21 at 32-33].[fn6]
14) It is important to note, however, that flying above the lead aircraft's flight path does not necessarily guarantee that the second aircraft will avoid the wake vortex because, as previously noted, wakes do not always descend. Instead, wakes may [*7] behave randomly, capriciously, follow no set path, and can sometimes rise. Indeed, Rivers testified that he once hit a wake vortex while flying behind a C-130 that was 500 feet above the preceding aircraft's flight path and about 7 miles entrail [Tr. 854-56]. Video of that encounter was introduced and played during trial. 
15) Another way to try and avoid wake turbulence is to maintain adequate separation between the two aircraft while landing. The idea is that the vortices will roll off the wingtips of the lead aircraft and dissipate (particularly if the vortices are low and impacting the ground). At the time of the crash, two minutes of separation was recommended — not required — under the USAF syllabus training manual [see Tr. 296; 602]. Two minutes is the equivalent of approximately four nautical miles lateral separation with an aircraft landing speed of 120 knots. However, it was not normal or standard practice in the 319th SOS to use a clock or stopwatch to time the separation for landing [Tr. 353-54; 1026, 1038-39]. Instead, the pilots would use the visual or field separation method, whereby they would first ensure that the preceding aircraft was on final approach and passed abeam of the second airplane in the opposite direction, and then continue downwind until the runway threshold was approximately 45 degrees behind the wing before beginning the turn base leg and completing the landing pattern. At the time of the crash in this case, this was the standard method to ensure that there was adequate separation between two aircraft landing at Hurlburt Field.[fn7]
16) As with the "fly high and land long" method, the separation method does not necessarily guarantee that a smaller aircraft following a larger aircraft will not encounter a wake vortex. Indeed, as previously discussed, wakes are often unpredictable and can — depending on various atmospheric conditions and other factors — persist for up to several minutes. Rivers testified at trial, for example, that during the course of his research he encountered "strong" wakes in excess of 6 minutes and up through 8 minutes old [see Tr. 851; 918-19]. In fact, out of the several thousand wake penetrations that he made in the OV-10, he testified that the strongest wake that he ever encountered — and the only one strong enough to have induced an uncommanded roll in excess of 90 degrees — was left by a C-130 that was over 6 minutes old [Tr. 871]. 
17) In short, given their invisibility, randomness, and unpredictability, the challenge of avoiding wake vortices can be a difficult — almost impossible — task. The danger of encountering wake turbulence is greatly increased if the following, smaller aircraft is near to the ground, at a slow airspeed, and already in a rapid rate of descent — exactly the conditions set up by flying in a random shallow approach. 
The Crash 
18) On the night of July 8, 2008, the weather conditions at Hurlburt Field were clear, stable, and generally not a problem (at least not in terms of ceiling and visibility) [Tr. 280, 465, 471]. However, there were consistent light southeasterly surface — or "light quartering" [*8] — tail winds of approximately 3 to 5 knots, varying between 140 and 160 degrees, up to 1,200 feet altitude [see Tr. 465-66]. Notably, however, the designated runway in use at Hurlburt Field that evening was Runway 36 instead of Runway 18. As a result, the aircraft were not landing into the wind, but were landing with a light quartering tailwind. Everyone appears to agree in this case that the atmospheric conditions that night were "ideal" for the formation (and persistence) of wake turbulence [see,e.g., Tr. 406-07, 471-73; see also Tr. 329]. In fact, in an atmosphere like there was on the night of the mishap, "vortices can last two or more times longer" than usual [see Tr. 918]. Despite these atmospheric conditions, the Hurlburt Field tower did not issue a wake turbulence advisory to the pilots flying that night. 
19) On the night of the crash, Howard was providing PC-12 training for two Air Force combat pilots: then Captain (now Major) Michael P. Ellis, and then Captain (now Major) Peter R. McWilliam. The crew was assigned the Aircraft for their training sortie, and they were given the call sign "Slayer 28." Maj. Ellis and Maj. McWilliam were not "student pilots" being introduced to the aircraft. Rather, they were both highly experienced, combat-tested PC-12/U-28 pilots undergoing recurrency and proficiency training.[fn8]
20) The scheduled total time for the training mission was four hours, and it began at about 8:00 p.m. The first part of the mission was flown in daylight, and it consisted of recurrency training for Maj. McWilliam on short field operations. Maj. McWilliam, in the left pilot seat, and Howard, instructing from the right seat, flew a series of landings at other auxiliary airfields near Hurlburt Field. 

21) After the sun set, the crew began using night vision goggles ("NVG"), which were about 6 inches long, similar in style to binoculars, and attached to the front of their flight helmets. Because NVGs are designed to enable the user to see in the dark, they are "incompatible" with white light. The presence of white light can cause a "bloom" effect while using NVGs, which can "wash out" or otherwise adversely affect visual acuity (such as decreased depth perception). Because even cockpit lighting can "drive night vision goggles crazy" [Tr. 491], once the crew of Slayer 28 began using NVGs, they landed the Aircraft and taped up some of the cockpit displays with film so the lights from the instruments would not "bloom out" [Tr. 157]. Normally, the use of NVGs requires that the runway lights on the landing field also be dimmed. 
22) Maj. McWilliam made a few landings wearing NVGs, after which he and Maj. Ellis "swapped seats" so that Maj. Ellis could take over. Thereafter, Maj. Ellis flew various instrument approaches and landings at nearby airfields to regain currency in NVG operations. Howard remained in the right seat as instructor pilot. Both Maj. Ellis and Howard wore NVGs throughout the rest of the mission. After the seat swap, Maj. McWilliam sat in the right rear passenger seat of the Aircraft, where he remained an active member of the crew and assumed two distinct roles: 1) safety observer (i.e., he was to "speak [*9] up" if he saw that the flight was at risk or otherwise following a dangerous path), and 2) student (i.e., he was to try and become a better pilot by plugging into the communications radio and listening to the crew as it flew) [see Tr. 158-60]. 
23) At around 11:00, the pilots returned to Hurlburt, where Howard and Maj. Ellis practiced an ILS (Instrument Landing System) approach and remained in the VFR (Visual Flight Rules) pattern and performed several touch-and-go landings [Tr. 68-69].[fn9] Because the crew of Slayer 28 was using NVGs and they wanted to avoid the blooming effect, they asked the tower to dim the runway lights, but that request was denied (because there were other aircraft in the landing pattern). The presence of the bright runway lights caused their goggles to "fog up", and caused their "visual acuity [to] significantly drop" [Tr. 317]. 
24) There were two other aircraft performing touch-and-go landings in the pattern that evening. Specifically, there was another PC-12/U-28 with the call sign "Slayer 25," and an AC-130U Hercules Gunship with the call sign "Spur 43." Spur 43 was attached to the 19th Special Operations Squadron (SOS) at Hurlburt Field. Spur 43 arrived back at Hurlburt after having completed its crew training, and it did a "Random Steep Approach" from 7000 feet as a series of spirals over the runway, executed a missed approach, and remained in the landing pattern. 
25) The AC-130U is a large gunship equipped with a 25-millimeter Gatling gun, a 40-millimeter Bofors cannon, and a very large 105-millimeter Howitzer. The landing weight of Spur 43 that night was about 125,000 lbs. The AC-130U is not only much heavier than the Aircraft — over 16 times heavier — but it is also much heavier, and generates stronger wake turbulence, than other models of the C-130 because of its weapons and ammunition. 
26) The AC-130 was equipped with a communications radio on the military's UHF frequency. The PC-12, meanwhile, was equipped with a civilian VHF communications radio. Consequently, the two aircraft could both talk to the tower, but they could not talk to each other, nor could either aircraft hear what the other was telling the tower. 
27) Major Meghan Ripple was the acting aircraft commander of Spur 43, and she was at the controls of the AC-130 at the time of the crash. Spur 43 was doing initial, not continuation, training that night. Shortly after the Aircraft entered the landing pattern, Maj. Ellis in Slayer 28 asked for clearance to perform a random shallow approach. The tower denied the request at first — because it could not be sequenced in — so Slayer 28 continued to perform touch-and-go procedures, while Slayer 25 and Spur 43 did the same. Maj. Ripple testified at trial that during these various approaches the Aircraft (Slayer 28) "was always abeam the approach end of the runway one-eighth on the downwind [when starting its landing approach] which would have been given plenty of spacing" between the two aircraft [see Tr. 247]. 
28) During one of these approaches, Slayer 25 (the other PC-12/U-28 in the pattern) encountered wake turbulence from Spur 43 [Tr. 919; Ex. 70 at 14-15]. Slayer 25 encountered the [*10] vortex even though it had maintained adequate spacing behind the C-130, and even though the "same type of spacing" was sufficient and "had not been an issue" on prior approaches [seeEx. 70 at 14]. However, on this particular approach, Slayer 25 encountered Spur 43's wake vortex, which resulted in an uncommanded "wing dip" roll of about 30 degrees, before the pilot was able to add power and go around. Notably, this encounter occurred approximately three and a half minutes after Spur 43 had most recently passed that location [Tr. 920]. The crew of Slayer 25 did not report this wake turbulence event to the tower or to the other aircraft flying in the pattern at that time. 
29) At some point, the crew of Spur 43 also requested permission to fly a random shallow maneuver, and that request was granted. This was (according to some of the testimony in this case) a somewhat unusual request because AC-130 gunships — as opposed to other variations of the C-130 — do not usually practice or use the random shallow approach [see Tr. 308-09, 338]. The tower told Slayer 28 that its earlier-denied request for the random shallow approach was now being granted, and it instructed Slayer 28 to follow behind Spur 43. The tower further told Slayer 28 to make a left 180 degree turn and follow the AC-130 for a random shallow maneuver to Runway 36.[fn10]
30) The pattern that was actually flown by the AC-130U at this time was a teardrop pattern from the center of the runway, with an extended downwind and extended final, which disrupted the separation. 
31) Although Maj. Ellis originally requested the random shallow approach, Howard actually performed it from the right seat, perhaps because the tower had directed both aircraft to use a right hand landing pattern instead of the customary left hand pattern. (Slayer 25 was using a left hand landing pattern). Although Spur 43 had called a left base, it actually flew a right base. 
32) As part of Crew Resource Management (CRM), the Air Force teaches that every member of the crew has the obligation and responsibility to "speak up" if he sees or perceives something that needs to be changed or corrected by the command pilot. 
33) In positioning the two aircraft for the random shallow approaches, the tower instructed Slayer 28 to make several turns to space Slayer 28 several miles north of the departure end of Runway 36, and the tower then instructed Slayer 28 when to turn south behind Spur 43 to begin Slayer 28's downwind leg. Slayer 28 then descended from 1200 ft to 600 ft indicated altitude (about 500 AGL) at 200 knots, which was the standard procedure for this approach. Slayer 28 was about 3.4 nautical miles behind Spur 43 at that time. However, unknown to Slayer 28, Spur 43 had slowed to approximately 150 knots while the PC-12 was following it downwind at about 200 knots. Thus, the separation was rapidly decreasing. 
34) Howard and Maj. Ellis were able to observe Spur 43 make its teardrop turn to final. When Maj. Ellis saw Spur 43 begin its approach, Slayer 28 was still north of the runway. 

35) Howard and Maj. Ellis could see that Spur 43 was ahead of them on downwind. However, because [*11] they were wearing the NVGs, Spur 43 appeared to them as "a little green blinking light" at an indeterminate distance ahead, as the NVGs reduced the ability to determine distance, and it was thus not possible to determine the rate of closure between the aircraft. However, Howard would not have performed the random shallow approach maneuver at night (beginning the landing approach at 200 knots and 500 feet) without NVGs. It would have been too dangerous as "you can't see the ground when you're that low and that fast" [Tr. 318]. 
36) As noted, Spur 43 declared that it was performing a random shallow approach prior to the mishap. Although one of the principal purposes — if not the principal purpose — of this maneuver is to keep the aircraft in tight to the runway environment and avoid exposing it to areas outside of that environment that might harbor hostile threats and forces, Spur 43 flew a very elongated teardrop approach and greatly extended its downwind. It flew well beyond the airfield boundary, past the barrier island and south over the Gulf of Mexico, without informing anyone that it was extending its approach. 
37) Spur 43 also made an unusual (and unexpected to Slayer 28) approach to Runway 36. It should have flown the downwind leg to Runway 36 at 200 knots, but it actually flew the downwind leg at about 150 knots, and later accelerated to about 170 knots as it descended. In addition, it overshot its turn to final, ending up to the west of the extended runway centerline, then it overcorrected and ended up to the east of the extended runway centerline, before it finally straightened out and became established on final and ultimately touched down further down the runway. This extended teardrop pattern was not the standard or "normal" random shallow approach [see, e.g., Tr. 312]. 
38) Spur 43 also flew a greatly extended and "dragged in" final approach, flying at approximately 100 feet MSL for an extended period of time. The radar returns also indicate that Spur 43 may have actually climbed in altitude for some of its approach and was maneuvering with up to 45 degrees angle of bank. 
39) Spur 43 eventually touched down approximately 2000 to 2500 feet down the runway from the approach end of Runway 36. Such a touch down point is abnormal. Maj. Ripple testified that she normally and "generally" aimed to touch down between 500 and 1000 feet from the threshold for a random shallow approach. Spur 43 thus landed considerably further down the runway than was "normal." Landing long is usually the result of being either too fast or too high (or both) on final. Reconstruction from, and interpretation of, the available radar data by Dr. Orloff (expert witness for the United States) shows that Spur 43's airspeed was slightly over 150 knots and it was maneuvering with almost 45 degree of bank as it approached the end of the runway. Since the radar returns (from the Eglin Air Force Base approach radar several miles away) were 4.6 seconds apart, we cannot precisely determine Spur 43's actual altitude during these maneuvers but it appears to have been between about 100 and 150 [*12] feet above ground level as it approached the runway threshold. 
40) The crew of Slayer 28 would have (and did) reasonably expect the crew of Spur 43 to execute the random shallow approach as it was customarily performed by C-130's and other aircraft at Hurlburt Field, including flying at the customary speed and landing at the customary landing point[fn11]
41) While Slayer 28 was on the downwind, Howard believed that he saw Spur 43 touch down on Runway 36 at approximately 1000 feet down the runway. This is where Howard reasonably expected Spur 43 to touch down. Slayer 28 was approximately abeam the threshold to the east of the runway when Howard made this observation. Using the NVGs, however, neither he nor Maj. Ellis could actually see the touch down spot, which as we now know was actually 2000 to 2500 feet down the runway. 
42) Howard testified that he planned to fly above Spur 43's flight path and touch down at a point approximately 1500 feet down the runway, and he voiced these intentions and observations to Maj. Ellis.[fn12] At this time, Slayer 28 was beginning its landing approach at 200 knots and its altitude was approximately 500 feet above ground level — both of which were appropriate for the random shallow maneuver that Slayer 28 was executing. 
43) Slayer 28 continued on the downwind leg until the threshold of the runway was about 45 degrees aft of its right wing, then Howard commenced the turn to base leg and reconfigured the Aircraft by reducing its power to flight idle, slowing down to approximately 120 knots, and lowering the landing gear and full flaps. Upon reaching 120 knots, Howard began his right turn to final and began his descent, aiming (according to Howard) to touch down about 1500 feet beyond the runway threshold; in other words, approximately 500 feet past the point where he perceived Spur 43 to have touched down. 
44) The Random Shallow Approach is a tight landing approach that begins at 500 altitude, instead of the normal 1000 feet. PC-12 pilots in the 319th SOS at the time of the crash typically tried to make the short final portion of their runway approach a five degree glide slope and — although not required by the maneuver —tried to perform it in such a manner that it did not require the addition of power to complete the landing. Howard, Maj. Ellis, and Maj. McWilliam testified that Howard flew the pattern as it was ordinarily done, and that the spacing between Slayer 28 and Spur 43 at the time Slayer 28 was on short final appeared to be about the same that is normally done in flying behind a C-130. 
45) Slayer 28 was banked almost 30 degrees to the right as it turned from base to final. As it turned out onto final, the Aircraft rolled from right to left to level out and end the turn. However, the roll did not stop when Slayer 28 was level. Instead, the Aircraft experienced a sudden and uncommanded roll to the left, with a bank angle exceeding 90 degrees — perhaps as much as 120 degrees. With the initial roll to the left, the nose tracked down. As the Aircraft rolled steeply left, it lost almost all vertical lift and began to drop precipitously. 
46) As [*13] the left roll started, Howard immediately turned the yoke to apply full right ailerons, and Maj. McWilliam — in the rear part of the Aircraft — recalled feeling the right rudder being applied. Referring to it as "fight or flight," Maj. Ellis instinctively joined Howard on the controls and found them already in the correct position to recover from the uncommanded roll. Howard and Maj. Ellis also both applied full power, the standard procedure for initiating a "go-around." The corrective inputs that Howard and Maj. Ellis made eventually had an effect, and the Aircraft began to recover from the left roll. However, it was not able to regain level flight, and it impacted the ground at a 64 degree left angle of bank. 
47) The Aircraft's left wingtip hit the ground one foot short of the runway threshold. After the impact, the Aircraft made a progressive veer to the left, going off the runway. It came to rest on Echo Taxiway facing east. Fortunately, the crew was able to escape with no serious injuries. 
48) The Aircraft was not equipped with a flight data recorder or similar device that measures and records the details of pilot inputs on the controls, the flight control positions and movements, aircraft pitch, and yaw, or most other performance data. Therefore, the dynamics of the last moments before the crash (specifically, when and where the Aircraft impacted the wake turbulence) cannot be precisely determined, and the parties' accident reconstructionists have wildly different opinions and calculations. However, the last two minutes of Slayer 28's flight were recorded by the Engine Condition Monitoring System (ECMS), and (when properly adjusted) provide some valuable information, especially for airspeed, altitude, and engine power settings. All this evidence has to be carefully weighted and evaluated. There is persuasive evidence in the record — including the trial and deposition testimony of the pilots on board and Rivers' analysis — suggesting that the wake encounter began when Slayer 28 was above the path of Spur 43. 
49) Based upon all the evidence in the record, the time between the vortex encounter and impact was greater than the 6.1 seconds as found by Dr. Winn, and the Aircraft must have been higher than 75 feet above the ground at the beginning of that encounter (see note 13, infra). After full review, I find by a preponderance of the evidence that the uncommanded roll started about 1200 to 1400 feet short of the runway threshold [Tr. 738], at an altitude of approximately 200 to 300 feet [Tr. 882-83]. Based on the radar returns and other evidence, this would indeed put Slayer 28 above the flight path of Spur 43 when it hit the wake vortex. 
50) The parties agree that, when the Aircraft had the vortex encounter, Slayer 28 was about 46 seconds behind Spur 43 (although Howard thought that he had about 60 seconds of separation). Nevertheless, at the time of the crash, being 46 seconds behind a larger aircraft was not unusual in the VFR pattern at Hurlburt Field [Tr. 1026, 1039]. 
51) Before the uncommanded roll, the crew of Slayer 28 did not perceive anything about the flight [*14] or the approach that was unsafe or in any way abnormal. Neither Maj. Ellis nor Maj. McWilliam perceived anything wrong with the way that Howard was performing the random shallow approach maneuver. It was apparently being flown as it was always flown. If Maj. Ellis or Maj. McWilliam had observed or perceived that anything was wrong with the approach, they would have spoken up and voiced their concern to Howard.[fn13]
52) In the moments leading up to the crash, the crew of Slayer 28 did not deviate or do anything different from the standard method of performing a random shallow approach at Hurlburt Field (that is, they determined proper separation by visually ensuring that the lead aircraft in its landing approach had passed abeam in the opposite direction and then continuing downwind past the runway threshold until the threshold was about 45 degrees behind the wing before beginning the turn to base leg and completing the landing pattern). 
53) In addition, Howard attempted to — and I find that he did — fly above Spur 43's flight path with the expressed intent of touching down beyond Spur 43's touch down point. 
54) The Aircraft sustained substantial physical damage as the result of the crash. The owner filed with Arch an estimate of the costs of repair in the amount of $2,916,733. Arch seeks to recover the amount it paid out against Avenge and the United States. 
55) The parties have stipulated that if Arch is entitled to recover in this subrogation action, its maximum recovery is the difference between the Aircraft's fair market value ($3 million) and its post-crash salvage value ($98,400), plus any applicable interest [see Doc. 155 at ¶¶ 54-57]. Arch's ability to recover, however, is necessarily dependent on Howard being negligent.[fn14]
II. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
Jurisdiction is proper in this federal court as the claims asserted against the United States have been brought under the Federal Tort Claims Act [see 28 U.S.C. § 2674], and Arch and Avenge are citizens of different states with an amount in controversy that exceeds $75,000 [see 28 U.S.C. § 1332]. The parties agree that the substantive law of Florida applies. See 28 U.S.C. § 1652; see also Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817 (1938). 

To prevail in a negligence action in Florida, the plaintiff bears the burden of proof and must establish the well-settled elements of a negligence claim. See, e.g., Clampitt v. D.J. Spencer Sales, 786 So.2d 570, 573 (Fla. 2001). Specifically, the plaintiff must show (1) that the defendant owed a duty of reasonable care to the plaintiff; (2) that the defendant breached that duty of care; (3) that the breach was the proximate cause of the injury to the plaintiff; and, (4) that the plaintiff suffered damages. Hasenfus v.Secord, 962 F.2d 1556, 1559-60 (11th Cir. 1992 (applying Florida law). Duty and damages have been established.[fn15] The case thus boils down to whether Howard breached the relevant standard of care and, if so, whether that breach of care was causally related to the harm that was suffered. 
To establish breach, Arch must show that, while Howard was executing the random shallow maneuver, he violated the standard of care, namely, the care that "a reasonably careful [pilot] would use under like circumstances." Daley [*15] v. United States, 792 F.2d 1081, 1085 (11th Cir. 1986) (Florida law). Both Arch and Avenge agree that a reasonably careful pilot in Howard's situation would have: "Remain[ed] above the flight path of the preceding aircraft" [see Tr. 913]. Arch's expert witness on the standard of care, Captain Gibson, thus testified that if Howard had remained above Spur 43's flight path, he would have met the applicable standard of care and would not have been negligent [see Tr. 509-10]. Put another way, Arch must prove that Howard was below Spur 43's flight path. As previously stated in my findings of fact, however, I find by a preponderance of the evidence that the Aircraft was above Spur 43's flight path at the time of the vortex encounter. Accordingly, per Arch's own expert witness, Howard satisfied the applicable standard of care and was not negligent. 
Arch strongly disputes the contention that Slayer 28 was above Spur 43's path at the time of the wake vortex encounter. It contends that Avenge has not offered any "plausible explanation" or theory for how Slayer 28 encountered the vortex above Spur 43's path. There are two problems with this. 
First, of course, it is not Avenge's burden to offer an explanation (plausible or otherwise) for how the accident happened. It is Arch's burden to explain how the accident happened and prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it was due to Howard's negligence. This Arch has not done. It has put forth (and is now bound by) a theory advanced by its expert witness (Dr. Winn) that is implausible, and ultimately at odds with the laws of physics. 
Second, while it was not required to, Avenge actually has put forth (two) possible theories of how the vortex encounter could have happened above Spur 43's flight path. Rivers has opined that, rather than hitting the vortex from Spur 43's last approach, Slayer 28 might have instead encountered the wake from an earlier approach by Spur 43 about 5 minutes and 40 seconds before.[fn16] Evidence at trial established that wake vortices can persist for upward of six to eight minutes, especially in the atmospheric conditions that existed that night, which were "ideal" for the formation and persistence of wake turbulence. Arch insists that this theory is "preposterous," and it notes that Rivers is the only expert who has mentioned it as a possibility [see, e.g., Doc. 181 at 1 (highlighting that "[f]our experts" testified the vortex that caused the crash was generated by the last approach, while Rivers is the "lone dissent" in suggesting it may have been an earlier one). However, it is axiomatic that it is not the sheer number of witnesses that counts. Rather, it is the weight and credibility of those witnesses, as determined by the finder of fact. See Jacksonville Traction Co. v. Greene, 113 Fla. 316, 317 (Fla. 1933) ("The maxim of the law is 'Ponderantur testes, non numerantur,' witnesses are not to be counted, but their testimony is to be weighed. It is the general rule in civil cases that a claim or defense can be established by a single witness. As an incident of their province to determine facts the credibility of witnesses is peculiarly a matter for the [finders of fact].") (internal [*16] citation omitted). I found Rivers to be credible and persuasive. What he has identified as a possible theory of what led to the mishap is plausible; or, at the very least, it cannot be dismissed as implausible. And in any event, it is certainly no less plausible than Arch's theory behind the crash. See note 13, supra. The evidence at trial was at worst "evenly balanced" and equipoised on this issue; and, in such a situation, the party that carries the burden of proof — Arch here —"must lose". See MetropolitanStevedore Co. v. Rambo, 521 U.S. 121, 137 n.9, 117 S.Ct. 1953, 1963 n.9 (1997).[fn17]
Another possible explanation for how Slayer 28 could have hit the vortex above Spur 43's path is the wake could have risen. Evidence at trial established that wakes behave randomly, unpredictably, and capriciously. This is (presumably) particularly so when the generating aircraft is itself maneuvering in all three axis unpredictably. It is not implausible to conclude — indeed, it is entirely possible —that, in the atmosphere that night, the wake vortex created by Spur 43 may have risen above its (extremely unusual) flight path. Although there is no test data in the record to reveal how these rather extreme maneuverings [see Ex. 73 at 8 (Fig. 4 of Dr. Orloff's report)] might affect the wingtip vortices, it would seem reasonable to conclude that there could be a significant effect. This could easily cause the wake to rise if the right combination of aileron, rudder, and elevator was used.[fn18]
Even if it is assumed that Rivers is wrong and that the other experts are right (and that Slayer 28 hit the wake generated by Spur 43's preceding pass, and that it did so because Howard failed to fly above the flight path) that does not necessarily mean Howard was negligent. During the approach, Howard stated that he intended to fly above the flight path of Spur 43. The fact that he (arguably) did not execute his plan successfully does not automatically mean that he violated the standard of care. See Kraver v.Edelson, 55 So.2d 179, 180 (Fla. 1951) ("[n]ot every accident is the result of negligence'"); Belden v. Lynch, 126 So.2d 578, 581 (Fla.2d DCA 1961) ("negligence may not be inferred from the mere happening of an accident alone"). First, it appears that Spur 43's flight path and touch down point may not have been where a reasonably careful and experienced pilot would have expected them to be. Second, in determining whether Howard failed to use the care that "a reasonably careful [pilot] would use under like circumstances" [Daley, supra , 792 F.2d at 1085], it is, of course, necessary to carefully consider the "circumstances" under which he was flying at the time of the mishap. Cf. McMahon v.Presidential Airways Inc., 502 F.3d 1331, 1365 (11th Cir. 2007) (explaining that the "flexible standards of negligence law" allow courts to apply different standards of care to "varying fact situations"; thus, a different standard of care might apply to a pilot "flying over Kansas on a sunny day" as opposed to "flying over Afghanistan during wartime"). The circumstances under which Howard was flying and which led up to the crash include: 
(1) the light quartering tail winds; 
(2) the use of Runway 36; 
(3) the tower not issuing a wake turbulence advisory; 
(4) the crew practicing [*17] a random shallow approach (itself a combat maneuver) at night (with another much larger aircraft in the pattern) while wearing NVGs; 
(5) the control tower refused to dim the runway lights; 
(6) Slayer 25 not reporting its earlier vortex encounter behind Spur 43; 
(7) the fact that Spur 43 — which, because of its mission as a large gunship, does not typically fly random shallow approaches at all — flew an unusual and non-standard random shallow approach; 
(8) the fact that Spur 43 and the Aircraft were on different radio frequencies and thus could not communicate with one another; 
(9) the fact that Spur 43 had flown an extended final and landed long was not communicated to the tower or to Slayer 28; 
(10) the hazardous mix at night of the two PC-12s (one flying a left pattern and another a right pattern) and the AC-130 in a right landing pattern, with two of them doing random shallow approaches; and 
(11) the fact that Slayer 28 hit the turbulence at the precise point in the vortex where it was capable of rolling the Aircraft. 

In short, there are many circumstances and events that may have combined to contribute to the mishap.[fn19]

After close and careful review of all the evidence, I conclude that Arch has not carried its burden of establishing that Howard deviated from the "reasonably careful pilot" standard of care. By all accounts, Howard was a very well regarded and experienced pilot. He testified — and I found his testimony credible, and Maj. Ellis and Maj. McWilliam generally confirmed — that he flew the random shallow approach maneuver that night as he and other pilots in the 319th SOS at Hurlburt Field were trained to do and in the standardized manner and that, before the wake vortex encounter, everything appeared to be normal. The fact that everything was not normal in hindsight does not, by itself, prove breach of the reasonably careful pilot standard of care. Sometimes an accident is just that: an accident. See Kraver, supra , 55 So.2d at 180; Belden, supra , 126 So.2d at 581. 
As there was no breach of the standard of care, there can be no causation. See Greene v. Flewelling, 366 So.2d 777, 780 (Fla.2d DCA 1978) (describing as "rudimentary" the notion that the plaintiff must show that there was a violation of the applicable standard of care that was the cause of the claimed damages). 
In rendering this decision, I do not mean to suggest or imply that, because wake vortices can often be random and unpredictable, a pilot involved in a wake-related crash could never be found to have been negligent. I merely find that, on the unique facts of this particular case, the plaintiff has not carried its burden of proof in establishing breach of the duty of care and causation, as opposed to an unfortunate and unavoidable accident.[fn20]
III. CONCLUSION
In closing, I note that there are many unanswered questions about the crash, and there is evidence of record that could support a number of possible outcomes in this case. There is evidence that Howard was negligent, and there is evidence that the United States was negligent. And there is also evidence that neither was negligent and that the mishap was the result of a "perfect storm" of unfortunate [*18] and unforseen circumstances. Some impressive and heavily-credentialed witnesses testified in support of these various points of view. After careful review, I find that a preponderance of the evidence does not support the plaintiff's claims, and because the plaintiff carries the burden of proof, judgment must be entered in favor of the defendants.[fn21]

For the reasons stated above, the Clerk shall enter judgment in favor of the defendants and against the plaintiff, together with taxable costs.

[fn2] Wake turbulence is the term used to describe the vortices that roll up from the wingtips of an aircraft as it passes through the air. When viewed from the rear of the generating aircraft, the left wing's vortice spins clockwise, while the right wing's vortice spins counterclockwise. The strength of the vortices is proportional to the weight of the aircraft. Accordingly, the larger (and heavier) the aircraft, the larger (and stronger) the wake turbulence. 
[fn3] Lieutenant Colonel Dagvin Robert Anderson was the operations officer for the 319th SOS from August 2007 to April 2009. He testified that there were only 60 pilots in the unit when he first arrived, and there were almost 200 when he left in 2009 [Tr. 801-03]. 
[fn4] Some of my findings of fact regarding wake vortices are taken from the two expert reports and live trial testimony of Avenge's expert witness, Robert A. Rivers. In addition to his extensive qualifications, as previously set forth above, Rivers clearly "did his homework" in this case. Specifically, in preparation for his testimony, he went up in two aircraft to try and recreate the conditions of the flight that night in order to test the opinions and hypotheses that have been offered. He first went up in a Cessna 172, and then he went up in a PC-12 that was "identical" to the Aircraft [Tr. 886-89]. During these tests, he tried "to replicate exactly — as close as we could the exact condition of the airplane at the time plaintiffs postulate it encountered the vortex" [see Tr. 902] by, interalia, "loading appropriate fuel" to ensure that his PC-12 was the same weight as the Aircraft at the time of the crash [ id. 889]. After close and careful review of his two reports and testimony, and after observing his demeanor during trial, I found him to be both knowledgeable and very credible. 
[fn5] Rivers testified at trial that "you're more likely to win the Power Ball lottery than you are to be involved in a wake vortex accident" [Tr. 987]. 
[fn6] There was no specific training or formal program on wake avoidance in the 319th SOS [e.g., Tr. 289-92, 629-30]. Rather, the Air Force's pilots were generally told about it during basic flight training and SIMCOM, and they were expected to be aware of and adhere to the relevant sections of the AIM, advisory circulars, and CONOPS. 
[fn7] The fly high and land long method is independent of the visual separation method. This is because, if the pilot stays above the flight path of the lead aircraft and lands beyond its touch down point on the runway, the pilot generally does not worry about separation as the paths will not (ordinarily) cross, and thus separation "doesn't make any difference" [seeTr. 780-81; see also Tr. 406]. 
[fn8] Maj. McWilliam was an aircraft commander in the PC-12 and had logged approximately 865 hours in the aircraft. Maj. Ellis, meanwhile, had been a PC-12 instructor himself and had logged about 1,700 hours in the aircraft — which was actually twice the hours than Howard had logged in the PC-12 [Tr. 792]. He was undergoing "training" on the night of the crash because he had not flown for five weeks while he was on a temporary duty assignment for squadron school in Montgomery, Alabama, and he merely "needed to get recurrent on flight status" [see Tr. 58-59], so he practiced with instrument approaches and night landings. 
[fn9] A touch-and-go landing is a maneuver that involves landing an aircraft on the runway and then taking off again without coming to a full stop. 
[fn10] Because the winds at Hurlburt Field that night, although light, were from the southeast, Runway 18 should have been used instead of Runway 36. 
[fn11] Almost everything that Spur 43 did during its random shallow approach was unusual. Maj. Ripple testified that certain parts of this non-standard approach (specifically, the first overshoot) were done intentionally and for training purposes [see Tr. 225-26]. That may be true, but it does not change the fact that the crew of Slayer 28 reasonably expected — in the absence of being advised otherwise —that Spur 43 would fly the approach as it was typically performed at Hurlburt Field at that time. 
[fn12] While Maj. Ellis testified that he did not have any specific recollection of Howard stating his intentions, he does not dispute or deny that Howard did so. 
[fn13] Arch's theory of the case (per its expert witness Dr. Winn) has been that the wake vortex encounter took about 6.1 seconds and occurred 500 feet from the runway with an intended touch down of 1500 feet at an altitude of 75 feet (with a pre-existing 1100 per minute rate of descent) and ground speed of 95 knots. I find, as Avenge has argued, that this scenario is implausible. It would not be the sort of approach that experienced PC-12 pilots would have undertaken. Lieutenant Colonel Brian Betts, who had been teaching the random shallow approach at Hurlburt Field since 2007, testified during the trial that he attempted to fly the PC-12 in the way that the plaintiff's theory postulates, and he had to pull out before hitting 75 feet altitude because he "couldn't take it any more" as it was "becoming unsafe" and "well beyond what I considered a normal anything" [see Tr. 1024-25]. It is simply not credible that experienced PC-12 pilots could have possibly considered such an approach "normal" (see id. at 1025 (referring to that approach as not "anywhere close to normal")]. I agree with Rivers that, if the plaintiff's theory were correct, the crew of Slayer 28 would have detected the dangerous situation they were in long before the uncommanded roll began [Tr. 913]. Given the magnitude of errors in the radar and altitude data, along with assumptions for reaction times and sink rates at 90 degrees angle of bank, it is impossible to determine with certainty the exact parameters of Slayer 28's approach. Nevertheless, a preponderance of the evidence negates Dr. Winn's opinion as to the encounter time, distance from the runway, and altitude at encounter. 
[fn14] There is a plausible argument to make — and, indeed, earlier in this case the argument was made — that the United States was negligent independent of Howard. The plaintiff argued, for example, that the United States should not have selected Runway 36 that evening (because of the light quartering tail winds); the tower should have issued a wake turbulence advisory; and the crew of Slayer 25 violated regulations by not reporting the turbulence that they encountered earlier that night. (One could also argue that the United States should not have allowed a relatively small PC-12 to perform dangerous low altitude nighttime approaches at the same time as a much larger and heavier AC-130 Hercules gunship). However, Arch expressly abandoned all these claims during trial and argued that the United States was negligent only to the limited extent that Maj. McWilliam and Maj. Ellis violated CRM by failing to "speak up" as Howard negligently attempted the random shallow maneuver. Consequently, to find in favor of the plaintiff, I must first find that Howard was negligent. If he was not, it flows therefrom that the United States was not negligent either. The discussion that follows will thus be limited to Howard and his alleged negligence. 
[fn15] Avenge does not dispute that the plaintiff sustained damages. However, Avenge argues that it owed no duty to Arch's subrogor, SNC, because the United States was "putative owner" of the Aircraft. Insofar as Avenge had "no knowledge that anyone other than the USAF was owner of the Aircraft," it asserts that it had "no reason to believe that it owed a duty of care to anyone other than the USAF." Avenge has not cited to — nor have I been able to locate — any case law holding that an alleged tortfeasor owes no duty to the owner of damaged property unless the tortfeasor knew the owner's true and actual identity at the time of the alleged tort. Avenge's argument on this point fails. 
[fn16] During its cross examination of Rivers (and during its subsequent closing argument), Arch highlighted the fact that Rivers had originally calculated the prior pass as being about 7 minutes earlier. Rivers testified at trial that he had made an error in his original analysis, so he corrected it. The mere fact that Rivers corrected his analysis does not carry the weight that Arch apparently believes, as virtually all of the experts in this case have at one time or another corrected and changed their analyses. 
[fn17] During the course of explaining why his possible theory is the more likely, Rivers testified that, based on his "well over a thousand" penetrations behind a C-130, "no wake that I ever saw . . . grew to a diameter large enough in 46 seconds, especially in that type of atmosphere in any altitude . . . to cause that upset" [see Tr. 936-37; see also Tr. 876]. I agree that it is highly unlikely for a wake vortex to expand so quickly. 
[fn18] I note once again that Rivers testified at trial — and introduced a video to support — that he had previously hit a wake vortex while following behind a C-130 that was 500 feet above the flight path and approximately 7miles entrail [Tr. 855-56]. 
[fn19] While most of the trial focused on Howard's alleged negligence for failing to "fly high and land long", there was some suggestion that Howard should not have been only 46 seconds behind Spur 43, and that the accident would not have happened if he had maintained 2 minutes separation [see Tr. 388; 405-06 (opining that the mishap would have been "very unlikely" if Howard had been two minutes entrail) (testimony of Dr. Winn)]. This argument fails for three reasons. First, as Dr. Winn further testified, if the Aircraft was above Spur 43's flight path at the time of the wake vortex encounter, it did not matter whether Howard was 46 seconds (or 2 minutes) entrail [id. at 406]. As I previously stated, Arch has failed to prove that Howard was below Spur 43's path. Moreover, even if the Aircraft was below Spur 43's path, it was not negligence to follow 46 seconds behind Spur 43 instead of maintaining the recommended — not required — two minutes separation. Howard flew the approach in the same manner that it was always flown in the 319th SOS. See Muncie Aviation Corp. v. Party Doll Fleet, Inc., 519 F.2d 1178, 1180-81 (5th Cir. 1975) (noting in aviation negligence case that the customs and practices in a particular group or organization are evidence of the relevant standard of care). The mere fact that the spacing may have arguably proved inadequate on this occasion does not negligence make. (Of course, separation for a random shallow approach has to be established on the downwind entry. To do the approach correctly, it has to be tight from the 180 position to touch down, so extending downwind for separation would negate the purpose. Thus, when the Aircraft turned downwind behind Spur 43 they were about 3.4 nautical miles apart — the equivalent of 1 minute and 42 seconds at the assumed approach speeds of 120 knots. The fact that the two aircraft did not maintain that separation was due to Spur 43's nonstandard approach and not to anything Howard did.) And lastly, even if I were to assume (contrary to the evidence) that it somehow fell below the standard of care for Howard to use the visual (field) separation method instead of precisely clocking two minutes separation, Arch has not shown that this breach was causally related to the mishap. There is no reason to believe — and considerable reason to doubt —that the crash could have been avoided if Howard had been able to extend the final separation an extra minute and 14 seconds. As has been noted several times now, wake vortices can persist for up to several minutes, particularly in atmospheric conditions like existed on the night of the mishap. Indeed, Slayer 25 encountered wake turbulence generated by Spur 43 earlier in the evening that was significant enough to force an uncommanded 30 degree wing dip, even though there was over three and a half minutes of separation between those aircraft at that time. Arch has not established that Howard's failure to keep two minutes of separation, assuming arguendo it was negligent, was causally related to the mishap. See, e.g., Stahl v. Metropolitan Dade Cty, 438 So.2d 14 (Fla.3d DCA 1983) (explaining that Florida courts follow the "but for" causation test, i.e., there must be such a natural, direct, and continuous sequence between the negligent act or omission and the injury that it can be said that "but for" the negligent act or omission the injury would not have occurred). 
[fn20] Obviously, as has been argued throughout this case, the crash could have been avoided if Howard had timely executed a "go-around" before encountering the wake vortex. However, the question is not whether Howard could have avoided the crash by abandoning the approach altogether. The question is whether a reasonably careful pilot in his situation — based on the circumstances that were known or reasonably should have been known to him at that time — would have thought it necessary to do so, or would have been able to do so. Cf. Smith v. Illinois Central R.R. Co., 486 F.2d 943, 945-46 & n.1 (5th Cir. 1973) (approving the following jury instruction: "Lastly, in connection with negligence and proximate cause the mere happening of an accident does not necessarily mean that someone is negligent. In law we recognize what are termed unavoidable or inevitable accidents. These terms do not mean literally that it was not possible for such an accident to be avoided. They simply denote an accident that occurred without having been caused by negligence, even though such accident should have been avoided by the exercise of exceptional foresight, skill or caution, still no one may be liable for injuries resulting from it."). I conclude that no reasonably careful military pilot in Howard's situation would have thought it necessary to completely abandon the approach. 
[fn21] As I have ruled in favor of the defendants, I need not reach certain of the disputed issues of law that were identified by the parties before and during trial, e.g., whether Howard was a government employee or independent contractor, etc.

CHARLES A. STAMPELOS 
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
Plaintiff filed a Complaint on November 16, 2012, alleging patent infringement by Defendant Craig A. Oehme (hereinafter Oehme), who owns and operates "E.E. Pauley Plastic Extrusion," and another corporation, Defendant Polytechnics Corporation, which is a suspended California corporation. Doc. 1 at 1-2. The Complaint alleged that Defendants are "making, selling, and/or offering to sell plastic trim products in the State of Florida, in this judicial district, and elsewhere in the United States, plastic trim strip products" that are covered by Plaintiff's Patents 222 and 472.  Id. at 2-3. The Complaint asserts two counts for infringement: count I is premised on infringement of products covered by Patent 222 and count II is premised on an infringement of products covered by Patent 472. Doc. 1.
On March 7, 2013, Defendant Oehme filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction or, in the alternative, a motion to transfer venue. Doc. 10. Plaintiff filed a response in opposition, doc. 12, and this case was referred for a hearing on the motion. Doc. 13. An evidentiary hearing was held on June 6, 2013, to consider evidence relevant to the motion. 1 Docs. 25, 27. The parties jointly submitted Index 1 into evidence which is a composite of exhibits 1 through 312 and titled "Stipulated Evidence." 2 Thereafter, Plaintiff filed a notice of inadvertently omitted exhibits, 3 doc. 26, omitted from Plaintiff's response to the motion to dismiss or to transfer. Additionally, Oehme filed a supplement to the motion to dismiss, doc. 30, and an affidavit, doc. 31. Plaintiff has filed a supplemental brief on the evidence as well, doc. 32, although the supplement is sealed upon consent of the parties.
Standard of Review 
Because this case involves claims of patent infringement, Federal Circuit law governs the personal jurisdiction issue. Avocent Huntsville Corp. v. Aten Int'l Co., 552 F.3d 1324 , 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2008), cited in Atlantis Hydroponics, Inc. v. International Growers Supply, Inc., 915 F. Supp. 2d 1365 , 2013 WL 28102 , at *4 (N.D. Ga. 2013). It has been well established since the Supreme Court decided International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310 , 66 S.Ct. 154 , 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945), "that in order to subject a defendant to an in personam judgment when he is not present within the territory of the forum, due process requires that the defendant have certain minimum contacts with the forum such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice." Venetian [*2] Salami Co. v. Parthenais, 554 So.2d 499 , 500 (Fla. 1989). The Court clarified "that the test is whether the defendant's conduct in connection with the forum state is 'such that he should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there.' " World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286 , 100 S.Ct. 559 , 62 L.Ed.2d 490 (1980), quoted in Venetian Salami Co., 554 So.2d at 500 . In applying that test and determining whether sufficient minimum contacts exists depends, the facts are crucial to a court's analysis. See Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462 , 105 S.Ct. 2174 , 85 L.Ed.2d 528 (1985). Thus, it is sometimes necessary to hold an evidentiary hearing to consider all the facts necessary to resolve a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. See Kemin Foods, L.C. v. Omniactive Health Technologies, Inc., 654 F.Supp.2d 1328 , 1334 (M.D. Fla. 2009) (finding that "[i]n some circumstances the Court is required to hold an evidentiary hearing to resolve disputed facts if they are essential to the jurisdictional determination."). Federal Circuit law directs "that where jurisdictional facts are in dispute, a district court must hold an evidentiary hearing in order to impose the heightened preponderance standard." Campbell Pet Co. v. Miale, 542 F.3d 879 , 888 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (noting that when an evidentiary hearing is not held, "a plaintiff need only make a prima facie showing of jurisdiction to survive the motion to dismiss."); Crowe v. Paragon Relocation Resources, Inc., 506 F.Supp.2d 1113 , 1119 (N.D. Fla. 2007) (stating that when affidavits conflict, "the court must conduct an evidentiary hearing in order to resolve the issues of disputed fact" concerning personal jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant); Burton v. Subaru of America, Inc., 646 F.Supp. 78 , 78 (N.D. Ga. 1986) (noting that the "court may proceed to decide the jurisdictional question upon the pleadings and affidavits or it may choose to require an evidentiary hearing where issues of credibility or disputed fact must be resolved."); Venetian Salami Co., 554 So.2d at 503 (remanding for a limited evidentiary hearing on the jurisdictional issue because facts set forth in affidavits could not be reconciled to determine whether personal jurisdiction exists). Here, this case was referred specifically for that purpose, doc. 13, and notwithstanding that the Court is called upon to resolve a motion to dismiss, affidavits and evidence may be considered. "Where, as here, personal jurisdictional is determined after an evidentiary hearing, the plaintiff must establish the requisite jurisdictional facts by a preponderance of the evidence." Peavy v. Klausner, No. 8:11cv508, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97271 , 2011 WL 3841633 , at *1 (M.D. Fla. Aug. 3, 2011), citing Tommy Bahama Gp., Inc. v. Eagle, No. 3:09cv641, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86469 , 2010 WL 3340538 , at *2 (M.D. Fla. Aug. 23, 2010); Resolution Trust Corp. v. Pharaon, 915 F.Supp. 351 , 358 (S.D. Fla. 1996); Welt Indus., Inc. v. Weingart, Inc., 660 F.Supp. 424 , 425 (N.D. Ga. 1987). The parties do not disagree that the preponderance of the evidence standard is applicable in resolving the motion to dismiss. Doc. 28 at 7.
Motion to Dismiss, doc. 10 
Defendant Oehme's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, doc. 10, asserts that Oehme resides in California, his business is solely in California (with no other offices outside the state) and although that business has a website, it is "not interactive in that no sales" are possible from the website. Doc. 10 at 8-9. Oehme also [*3] asserts that the website "is not targeted at or directed to any specific state, such as" Florida.  Id. at 9. Oehme argues that all business documents are kept in California, no banking is done in Florida and Oehme has not contracted with any Florida entity "to provide him with services or goods that are either made in, originate in, or ship from" Florida. Id. 
Oehme further asserted in the motion to dismiss that "Oehme has never traveled to" Florida to either participate in any trade show or conference or "solicit or conduct business" in Florida.  Id. at 9. While Oehme has admittedly sold products in Florida, it is claimed that sales "are negligible" and that all products sold "were or are designed and made in and marketed from California."  Id. at 9-10. Oehme declares that in 2011, Oehme sold $43,473.20 of products in Florida, $2,203 in Northern Florida, and that the Florida sales represent only seven percent of all 2011 revenue. Doc. 10 at 10; doc. 11 at 7. In 2012, Oehme sold $50,368.52 of products in Florida, $1,530 in Northern Florida, and that the Florida sales represent only six percent of all 2012 revenue. Doc. 10 at 10, doc. 11 at 7. As of March 1, 2013, Oehme declares that $7,087.50 of sales were to Florida buyers, with just $1,077.50 of those sales going to buyers in the Northern District of Florida. Doc. 11 at 7.
Plaintiff's Response, doc. 12 
Plaintiff contends that Oehme sells products in the State of Florida and, as is customary in the industry, such products are sold "to a licensed installation business, reseller or contractor, rather than an end-user, due to the knowledge required to install the trim around the replacement doors and windows." Doc. 12 at 6. Plaintiff presented an affidavit in which Plaintiff asserts that Oehme "has repeatedly attempted to solicit sales from numerous existing customers" of Plaintiff's company, R.W.D. Innovative Specialty Trims LLC., within the State of Florida. Doc. 12-1 at 2. Plaintiff contends that it is irrelevant that Oehme did not actually travel to Florida to do so, doc. 12 at 6, because Oehme "initiated contact with numerous installation businesses within the state of Florida in order to solicit direct sales of Oehme's infringing product to these businesses." Doc. 12-1 at 2. Plaintiff avers that Oehme offered to sell its competing product to Folkers Window Company and to Window World of Tallahassee, Inc., and that Window World ceased purchasing trim products from Plaintiff and now has a purchasing relationship with Oehme.  Id., at 2-3. Both Folkers and Window World are located within the Northern District of Florida. Id. Plaintiff contends that due to Oehme's actively soliciting customers in Florida and the establishment of sales relationships in Florida for several years, in particular, in the Northern District of Florida, personal jurisdiction exists under Florida's long-arm statute and venue is appropriate in this Court. Doc. 12 at 7-16.
Evidentiary Hearing 
A transcript of the sealed evidentiary hearing has been filed as document 28. Furthermore, the parties submitted a book of Stipulated Evidence (containing exhibits 1-312) to be considered [*4] in ruling on the motion to dismiss. Following the hearing, the parties were permitted to submit supplemental memoranda.
Plaintiff points out that evidence was obtained through discovery which now reveals that Oehme sent "hundreds of direct mail pieces" to businesses in Florida, to as many as 176 Florida cities. Doc. 28 at 6. Plaintiff asserts the evidence shows that "Defendants affirmatively directed mailers in mass to businesses in the [S]tate of Florida, advertising the accused products from which sales resulted." Doc. 32-1 at 4. Plaintiff further asserts that Defendants maintain "ongoing sales of the accused product with multiple window installation companies" in Florida. Id. "Defendants were affirmatively aware of these relationships, shipped product to these businesses and attempted to maintain good working relationships with these businesses, along with maintaining credit card authorization agreements with the businesses." Id. 
Oehme points out in his supplemental memorandum that his business "only has had a total of 14 customers ever in" the State of Florida and contends that only Window World of Tallahassee is within this District. Doc. 30 at 2, citing to S.E. at 58-59. Oehme also asserts that beyond those customers, "Oehme's only other contacts with residents of this district . . . consists of the mailing of a non-state specific flier conducted as part of a nationwide advertising campaign." Doc. 30 at 5. "Oehme mailed this same geographically-neutral flier to 9909 addressees throughout the country which he found by running a non-geographic specific internet search on companies which he believed would be in need of his window trim product by using the search terms 'window replacement', 'window glass', 'window manufacture', or other terms related to 'windows'." Id., citing to S.E. at 256; see also doc. 31, Ex. A.
The joint evidence reveals that Oehme and his company sent direct mailers 4 to companies all over the United States. Doc. 31, Ex. A. In particular, Oehme sent mailers to 640 businesses in the State of Florida.  Id. at 54-68. 5 Defendant asserts the "mailers did not constitute specific offers for sale, but merely apprised the recipient thereof of Oehme's products and contact information." SE at 28. In Defendant's deposition, when asked how he "advertised [his] trim products," Defendant responded: "Mailers." S.E. 256:2-4. Defendant Oehme went on to explain that mailers are sent and if the company responds, Defendant then begins communication.  Id. at 257:5-9.
The list of mailers sent to Florida businesses varies slightly, see n.5 supra, but the parties stipulated evidence shows that Oehme sent mailers to 687 businesses in Florida. S.E. at 28, 58-77. Furthermore, Plaintiff has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that Oehme has 17 clients in the State of Florida, see S.E. at 58-59, not just 14 as stated in Oehme's response, doc. 30.
Standard industry practice involves selling trim products to an installation business, reseller or contractor, who then provides "an end-user with an installation service which includes the cost of materials provided such as the [*5] trim and the replacement doors and windows." Doc. 12 at 6. "Thus the installation businesses typically make ongoing purchases of the trim products from one company over a period of time and provides installation of such trim products to multiple end-users." Id. Plaintiff points to evidence showing that Oehme's company "Pauley Plastics" made continuous and ongoing sales to Window World of Melbourne, Florida. Doc. 32-1 at 8. Oehme's invoices to Window World of Melbourne demonstrates 28 total sales between January 2011 and March 2013. S.E. at 124-135, 163-171, and 192-193. After purchasing product from Oehme, Window World then resells and distributes the product to multiple end-users (consumers) in the State of Florida. Doc. 32-1 at 8, citing doc. 28 at 11. In other words, the product is not an item a consumer would purchase but, rather, persons working in the industry (such as window dealers, window manufacturers, and window installers) purchase the item in bulk. Doc. 28 at 11, 7-5. To put this into perspective, review of the invoices reveals that in making those 28 purchases from Oehme, Window World of Melbourne put a total of 7,715 pieces of product into the stream of commerce in Florida.
There is also evidence that Oehme invoiced Window World of Ocala for 21 total sales between January 2011 and April 2013. S.E. at 136-140, 172-178, and 194-196. Those sales resulted in 11,106 pieces of product entering the stream of commerce in Florida. The evidence shows that Oehme invoiced Window World of Central Florida for 24 total sales between January 2011 and March 2013. S.E. at 112-123, 157-162, and 191. Those sales resulted in 8,375 pieces of product entering the stream of commerce in Florida. The evidence also reveals that most of Oehme's business in Florida has been with these three businesses, and they are ongoing, repeat customers who purchase more items with some regularity.
Oehme also had 7 total sales with Window World of Tallahassee and between February 2011 and February 2013, 1,750 pieces of product were purchased by that business and shipped into Florida. S.E. 144-146. 180-181. Sales from just these four businesses listed above resulted in a total of 28,946 pieces of product sold and shipped from Defendants into Florida to enter the stream of commerce in this State.
The stipulated evidence reveals that Oehme's sales in the United States generally, and in the State of Florida specifically have generally been increasing. S.E. at 269. In the year 2010, Oehme's total sales in the United States were $418,098.97, and in 2011, sales were up to $532,366.21, and up again in 2012 to $709,159.67. Doc. 30 at 3; S.E. at 269. Just through April of 2013, Oehme's total U.S. sales were at $303,257.54. Id. As for sales in the State of Florida, in the year 2010, Oehme sold $21,592.50 of product; in 2011, Oehme sold $42,373.20 of product in Florida, in 2012, Oehme sold $48,380.56 of product, and through April of 2013, Oehme's sales in the State of Florida were up to $29,879.40. Id. Thus, sales in Florida represent 5.1 percent of Oehme's total U.S. sales in 2010, 7.9 percent of total sales in 2011, 6.8 percent of total sales in 2012, and as of April, 2013, [*6] 9.8 percent of all revenue. Doc. 30 at 3; S.E. at 269. Those figures suggest an interest in increasing business and continuing sales.
Analysis 
"Jurisdiction to resolve cases on the merits requires both authority over the category of claim in suit (subject-matter jurisdiction) and authority over the parties (personal jurisdiction), so that the court's decision will bind them." Ruhrgas AG v. Marathon Oil Co., 526 U.S. 574 , 577 , 119 S.Ct. 1563 , 143 L.Ed.2d 760 (1999). Personal jurisdiction is a restriction on judicial power as a matter of individual liberty, and "a party may insist that the limitation be observed, or he may forgo that right, effectively consenting to the court's exercise of adjudicatory authority." Ruhrgas AG, 526 U.S. at 584 , 119 S. Ct. at 1570 . Unless waived, personal jurisdiction "is 'an essential element of the jurisdiction of a district ... court,' without which the court is 'powerless to proceed to an adjudication.' " Employers Reinsurance Corp. v. Bryant, 299 U.S. 374 , 382 , 57 S.Ct. 273 , 81 L.Ed. 289 (1937), quoted in Ruhrgas AG, 526 U.S. at 584 , 119 S. Ct. at 1570 .
A two-part inquiry is used in the Federal Circuit to determine whether the Court has personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant. Emissive Energy Corp. v. SPA-Simrad, Inc., 788 F.Supp.2d 40 , 43 (D.R.I. 2011). The first question considers whether jurisdiction exists under Florida's long-arm statute. Celorio v. Google Inc., 872 F.Supp.2d 1327 , 1330 (N.D. Fla. 2012), citing  Horizon Aggressive Growth v. Rothstein—Kass, 421 F.3d 1162 , 1166 (11th Cir. 2005). "If there is a basis for the assertion of personal jurisdiction under the state statute, the Court will next determine 'whether sufficient minimum contacts exist to satisfy the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment so that maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.' " Richards v. Sen, No. 07-14254, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 91518 , 2008 WL 4889623 , at *2 (S.D. Fla., Nov. 12, 2008)(other citations omitted). Thus, even if jurisdiction exists under Florida's long-arm statute, the Court must still review the facts to determine if the constitutional test is met. Celorio, 872 F.Supp.2d at 1330 ; Cable/Home Communication Corp. v. Network Productions, Inc., 902 F.2d 829 , 856 (11th Cir. 1990), quoting Venetian Salami Co., 554 So.2d at 500 .
Florida's long-arm statute, set forth at Fla. Stat. § 48.193(1)(b) , is satisfied when a defendant, or its agent, commits a tortious act within Florida. Courts have held that "[p]atent infringement constitutes a tortious act within the meaning of Florida's long-arm statute for the purposes of establishing personal jurisdiction." J.P. Morgan Trust Co. v. Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan, Inc., No. 3:05-cv-587-J-32-MCR, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23872 at *10, n.8 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 30, 2007); Mars, Inc. v. Coin Acceptors, Inc., 527 F.3d 1359 , 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2008); Kemin Foods, L.C. v. Omniactive Health Techs., Inc., 654 F. Supp. 2d 1328 , 1333 (M.D. Fla. 2009). It is not seriously disputed that Florida's long arm statute provides a jurisdictional basis for this case. See doc. 28 at 4.
The second question is "whether asserting personal jurisdiction over Defendant is consistent with the Due Process Clause." Emissive Energy Corp., 788 F.Supp.2d at 43 . "Due process is satisfied where a court has general or specific jurisdiction over a defendant." Id., citing Autogenomics, Inc. v. Oxford Gene Tech. Ltd., 566 F.3d 1012 , 1017 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Dram Tech. LLC v. America II Group, Inc., No. 2:10cv45, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 112532 , 2011 WL 4591902 , at *1 (E.D. Tex. Sept. 30, 2011) (stating "[p]ersonal jurisdiction has generally been divided into two categories: [*7] general personal jurisdiction and specific personal jurisdiction."). "General personal jurisdiction 'requires that the defendant have 'continuous and systematic' contacts with the forum state and confers personal jurisdiction even when the cause of action has no relationship with those contacts.' " Silent Drive, Inc. v. Strong Indus., Inc., 326 F.3d 1194 , 1200 (Fed. Cir. 2003). As correctly argued by Defendant Oehme, and conceded by Plaintiff, general personal jurisdiction is not applicable in this case. Doc. 30 at 1-8; doc. 32 at 3-4.
"The Federal Circuit applies a three prong test to determine if specific jurisdiction exists: (1) whether the defendant purposefully directed activities at residents of the forum; (2) whether the claim arises out of or relates to those activities; and (3) whether assertion of personal jurisdiction is reasonable and fair." Nuance Commc'ns, Inc. v. Abbyy Software House, 626 F.3d 1222 , 1231 (Fed. Cir. 2010); see also Dram Tech., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 112532 , 2011 WL 4591902 , at *1. Analysis of the first prong, 6 which considers whether "sufficient minimum contacts warrant assertion of personal jurisdiction, there must be 'some act by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting business within the forum state, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.' " Evanko v. WCDI, LLC, No. 11-1099, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14703 , 2012 WL 393261 , at * 3 (W.D. Pa. Feb. 6, 2012) (other citations omitted). As for the second prong, specific jurisdiction exists where the cause of action arises out of or relates to a defendant's contacts with the forum state, even if those contacts are isolated and sporadic. Trintec Indus. v. Pedre Promotional Prods., 395 F.3d 1275 , 1279 (Fed. Cir. 2005). The first two prongs relate to the requirement of "minimum contacts" and the third element relates to the notion of "fair play and substantial justice." Akro Corp. v. Luker, 45 F.3d 1541 , 1545-46 (Fed. Cir. 1995). "This test is intended to protect a non-resident defendant from jurisdiction based on contacts that are 'random, fortuitous,' or 'attenuated,' or that result from the unilateral activity of another party or a third person." Evanko, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14703 , 2012 WL 393261 , at * 3, citing to Burger King, 471 U.S. at 475 (citations omitted).
Oehme contends that in this case, advertisements are insufficient to establish jurisdiction. Doc. 30 at 9. In support, Oehme cites to Crochet v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., No. 6:11cv01404, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18258 , 2012 WL 489204 , at *3, n.3 (W.D. La. Feb. 13, 2012) which quoted from Quick Techs., Inc. v. Sage Group PLC, 313 F.3d 338 , 345 (5th Cir. 2002) (noting "[g]enerally, advertisements are insufficient to establish personal jurisdiction."). Crochet however, is a personal injury case, not a patent case, and not particularly relevant.
Oehme also points to Taylor v. Ishida Co., Ltd., 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9916 , 2002 WL 1268028 , at *4 (N.D. Tex. May 31, 2002), a patent case in which the plaintiffs filed suit in Texas and alleged "that defendants solicited business in the state of Texas, transacted business within the state, and/or derived financial benefit from the state directly related to the instant patent infringement cause of action and the infringing products." Taylor, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9916 , 2002 WL 1268028 , at *4. Relying on Viam 7 and World-Wide Volkswagen,  supra, and "the stream of commerce theory," the court noted that defendant HC sold the challenged product in Texas, "and about 4% of its total U.S. sales volume" was in the Northern [*8] District of Texas. 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9916 , [WL] at *5. The court found that the sales "were not isolated occurrences, but arose from" an effort "to serve the Texas market." Id. Furthermore, contacts could be expected to continue and there was evidence that defendants were looking at another potential large customer. Id. Based on those facts, the court held that it could exercise personal jurisdiction "under stream of commerce principles." 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9916 , [WL] at *6. That case, with limited sales of just four percent in Texas, weighs in Plaintiff's favor because the evidence here reveals Florida sales have been continuing and increasing for Oehme, and were up to nearly ten percent of Oehme's total sales. It would appear that Oehme's sales are increasing because of Oehme's marketing plan to provide over 600 Florida businesses a mailer which advertised the products challenged in this case.
Oehme challenges jurisdiction here also on the basis that "there is no indication of any alleged tort of patent infringement having occurred in this forum" and that mere consequences which stem from a tort injury do not confer personal jurisdiction at the site of those consequences. Doc. 30 at 9. In making that argument, Oehme cites to Allred v. Moore & Peterson, 117 F.3d 278 (5th Cir. 1997), a tort case for malicious prosecution and abuse of process where the only contact in Mississippi was service of process by certified mail from Texas to Mississippi. That case is not on point. Moreover, "[u]nder patent law, patent infringement occurs where the allegedly infringing sales are made." N. Am. Philips Corp. v. Am. Vending Sales, Inc., 35 F.3d 1576 , 1578-79 (Fed. Cir. 1994), cited in Quick Point, Inc. v. Excel Eng'g, Inc., No. 4:08cv797, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124201 , 2009 WL 330837 , at *4 (E.D. Mo. Feb. 9, 2009). It has been well established that "to sell an infringing article to a buyer in Illinois is to commit a tort there (though not necessarily only there)." N. Am. Philips Corp., 35 F.3d at 1579 , relied on in Litecubes, LLC v. Northern Light Products, Inc., 523 F.3d 1353 , 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2008); Instabook Corp. v. Instantpublisher.com, 469 F.Supp.2d 1120 , 1122-23 (M.D. Fla. 2006). Notwithstanding that design, marketing, and manufacturing occurred outside Florida, the fact remains that sales occurred in Florida and, thus, the alleged tort was committed in Florida.
Oehme asserts that a low level of sales of accused infringing products without a forum-based operation or offices "does not equate with purposeful direction of activities to a forum or the purposeful availment of the benefits and protections of the forum's laws and privileges." Doc. 30 at 9. Oehme maintains that its sales are small, there is only one customer in the Northern District of Florida, there was "no targeted advertising" but only "geographically-neutral mailers" sent, use of a non-interactive website, and no operations in Florida which would establish specific personal jurisdiction over Oehme. Doc. 30 at 8-13.
Prior to setting forth the relevant facts in this case, it is necessary to clarify what is not relevant. Oehme makes much of the fact that there are few customers in this District, but as pointed out by Plaintiff, doc. 32-1 at 5-6, the standard required for jurisdiction is there must "exist 'minimum contacts' between the defendant and [*9] the forum State." World-Wide Volkswagen, 444 U.S. 286 , 291 , 100 S. Ct. at 564 , citing International Shoe Co., 326 U.S. at 316 , 66 S. Ct. at 158 (emphasis added). Plaintiff is not required to show such contacts in this District, but within the State of Florida. Further, Oehme asserts that he "simply sent mailers to FL addressees . . . irrespective of location or whether the addressee was a customer of Plaintiff or any other company . . . ." Doc. 30 at 10. The claims raised in this case are not for the tortious interference with business relationships, but patent infringement. So long as the infringement took place in Florida through the sales of an allegedly infringing product, Florida's long-arm statute is applicable.
Applying the Federal Circuit's three prong test for specific jurisdiction reveals that the first factor is met as Oehme purposefully directed activities at the forum state. Plaintiff points to numerous facts to show by a preponderance of the evidence that Defendants purposefully directed activities into the State of Florida. First, "Defendants solicited sales by identifying potential purchasers, namely window installation companies, within the state of Florida, and directed advertising of the accused products to such businesses." Doc. 32-1 at 9. Oehme researched businesses in the industry in the State of Florida and mailed flyers advertising its products to well over 600 Florida businesses. Second, Oehme successfully created relationships with seventeen companies who have purchased products from Oehme, amounting to nearly ten percent of sales in the beginning quarter of 2013. Third, Oehme has established ongoing relationships with many of those businesses as the evidence reveals repeat sales on a fairly regular basis to several customers. 8 Thus, Oehme has continuing sales with Florida customers that are not isolated but repeat with regularity; that customer base is sufficient for "minimum" contacts. While there are only 17 Florida businesses listed as customers, due to the nature of the industry, those 17 businesses distribute and install Oehme's product to a multitude of end-users in Florida. The evidence reveals that nearly 29,000 pieces of product were sold and shipped into Florida from Oehme's top four purchasers alone.
Fourth, "Defendants have a credit card authorization agreement with Florida businesses who have recurring purchases through Defendants of the accused product." Doc. 32-1 at 7. Fifth, by virtue of the fact that Oehme's sales revenue has generally been increasing each year, Plaintiff asserts that Oehme and his company "anticipate and intend on future sales within the state of Florida . . . ." Id. Sixth, although Oehme does not maintain a warehouse or other office in Florida, Oehme has established an "operation" or enterprise to distribute its product "to end users within the state of Florida by selling to established ongoing customers who resell and install the accused trim products to end-users." Id. Seventh, "Defendants have received benefit from consumers within the state of Florida through the Defendants sales activities" as the invoices are all [*10] stamped "paid." Id. Eighth, Defendants have shipped their product into the State of Florida and have established a method for doing so.
The second prong of specific jurisdiction is met because Plaintiff's "claim arises out of or relates to" Oehme's conduct in selling a product which allegedly infringes on Plaintiff's patent. Nuance Commc'ns, Inc., 626 F.3d at 1231 ; Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Ctr. v. Branhaven, LLC, 861 F.Supp.2d 730 , 732 (E.D. Va. 2012); Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 841 F. Supp. 2d 514 , 521 (D.Mass. 2012), citing HollyAnne Corp. v. TFT, Inc., 199 F.3d 1304 , 1308 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (noting that an activity gives rise to a cause of action where it is a basis for the action).
As for the third and remaining prong, Oehme has argued that exercising "jurisdiction over Oehme would offend traditional notions of reasonableness and fairness." Doc. 10 at 22. Oehme contends that in considering the factors, 9 the burden on Defendant, a California resident, "to defend the suit in this Court would be significant." Doc. 10 at 15. Oehme, however, does not explain why it would be significant. Oehme also asserts that Florida's interest in this dispute is "minimal," an argument premised on the fact that the "small level of sales in" the State is not enough to provide a "significant interest in adjudicating the matter."  Id. at 15. Regarding the remaining factors, Oehme contends that California is the most appropriate court to hear this case as he has material contacts there and "nearly all the infringing actions took place" there.  Id. at 15-16.
Plaintiff on the other hand, asserts that he has an interest in protecting the patents against infringement, and because economic loss to Plaintiff occurred in this State, jurisdiction is appropriate, reasonable and fair here. Doc. 32-1 at 11; doc. 12 at 13. A State also "has an interest in discouraging injuries that occur within its boundaries, including injuries resulting from patent infringement." Elan Microelectronics Corp. v. Pixcir Microelectronics Co. Ltd., No. 2:10cv14, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19255 , 2012 WL 523695 , at *7 (D.Nev. Feb. 16, 2012); Beverly Hills, 21 F.3d at 1568 . "A State generally has a 'manifest interest' in providing its residents with a convenient forum for redressing injuries inflicted by out-of-state actors." Burger King Corp, 471 U.S. at 473 , 105 S. Ct. at 2182-83 .
Moreover, where individuals 'purposefully derive benefit from their interstate activities, Kulko v. California Superior Court, 436 U.S. 84 , 96 , 98 S.Ct. 1690 , 1699 , 56 L.Ed.2d 132 (1978), it may well be unfair to allow them to escape having to account in other States for consequences that arise proximately from such activities; the Due Process Clause may not readily be wielded as a territorial shield to avoid interstate obligations that have been voluntarily assumed. And because 'modern transportation and communications have made it much less burdensome for a party sued to defend himself in a State where he engages in economic activity,' it usually will not be unfair to subject him to the burdens of litigating in another forum for disputes relating to such activity.
Burger King Corp, 471 U.S. at 473-74 , 105 S. Ct. at 2182-83 (other citations omitted).

Plaintiff's interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution is met by continuing this case in this District where it has now been pending for [*11] eight months. Although California is presumed to be judicially efficient, the practical reality of transferring a case to another Court suggests that it is more efficient to retain the case in this forum. Plaintiff has the better of this argument and though there may be travel burden on Oehme, it is not unreasonable or unfair to require the defense of this case in this Court where Defendants' products were sold and will be used by Florida citizens. "The forum State does not exceed its powers under the Due Process Clause if it asserts personal jurisdiction over a corporation that delivers its products into the stream of commerce with the expectation that they will be purchased by consumers in the forum State." World-Wide Volkswagen, 444 U.S. at 297-98 , 100 S. Ct. 559 , quoted in Avocent Huntsville Corp, 552 F.3d at 1330 . Thus, Plaintiff has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the assertion of personal jurisdiction is "reasonable and fair." It is recommended that Defendant Oehme's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, doc. 10, be denied.
Venue 
A district court has authority under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) to transfer a civil action to any other district in which it might have been brought "for the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice." "Because federal courts normally afford deference to a plaintiff's choice of forum, the burden is on the movant to show that the suggested forum is more convenient or that litigation there would be in the interest of justice." In re Ricoh Corp., 870 F.2d 570 , 573 (11th Cir. 1989), cited in Carroll v. Texas Instruments, Inc., 910 F.Supp.2d 1331 , 1333 (M.D. Ala. 2012). Because resolution of the venue issue is a discretionary decision, the following factors should be weighed in ruling on a § 1404 motion to transfer:
(1) the convenience of the witnesses; (2) the location of relevant documents and the relative ease of access to sources of proof; (3) the convenience of the parties; (4) the locus of operative facts; (5) the availability of process to compel the attendance of unwilling witnesses; (6) the relative means of the parties; (7) a forum's familiarity with the governing law; (8) the weight accorded a plaintiff's choice of forum; and (9) trial efficiency and the interests of justice, based on the totality of the circumstances.
Manuel v. Convergys Corp., 430 F.3d 1132 , 1135 n.1 (11th Cir. 2005), 10 citing Gibbs & Hill, Inc. v. Harbert Int'l, Inc., 745 F.Supp. 993 , 996 (S.D.N.Y. 1990); Wi-LAN USA, Inc. v. Apple Inc., No. 12cv2438, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 47509 , 2013 WL 1343535 , at *2 (S.D. Fla. Apr. 2, 2013) (noting that "[n]o single factor is dispositive, and courts have differed in the weight afforded toeach individual factor.").

Initially, it is noted that this case could have been originally brought in California, but as determined in this Report and Recommendation, it is also permissible to file the case in this Court as personal jurisdiction is proper. Under the general venue statute, an action may be brought in "a judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a substantial part of property that is the subject of the action is situated." 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) . There is also a more specific venue provision for patent cases which provides that "[a]ny civil action for patent infringement [*12] may be brought in the judicial district where the defendant resides, or where the defendant has committed acts of infringement and has a regular and established place of business." 28 U.S.C. § 1400(b) . Notwithstanding the more specific provision, "the general rule that a specific statute is not controlled or nullified by a general statute regardless of priority of enactment, absent a clear intention otherwise, does not govern the present situation." VE Holding Corp. v. Johnson Gas Appliance Co., 917 F.2d 1574 , 1580-84 (Fed. Cir. 1990). "Since 1948, the general venue law has authorized suit against a corporate defendant not only where he maintains a 'regular and established place of business,' as in § 1400(b), but also where he is 'doing business.' 62 Stat. 935 , now § 1391(c)." VE Holding Corp., 917 F.2d at 1583 . Thus, the established law of the Federal Circuit is that "venue in a patent infringement case includes any district where there would be personal jurisdiction over the corporate defendant at the time the action is commenced."  Id. at 1583; see also Vivant Pharmaceuticals, LLC v. Clinical Formula, LLC, No. 10-21537, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37343 , 2011 WL 1303218 , at *2 (S.D. Fla. Mar. 31, 2011)(noting that "[f]or a corporate defendant, the reach of § 1400(b) is co-extensive with the personal jurisdictional requirements of 28 U.S.C. § 1391(c) .").
The first factor to be considered in deciding a motion for transfer is the convenience of the witnesses. Defendant Oehme contends that all non-party witnesses for Defendants reside in California "and would be subject to compulsory process there, not here." Doc. 10 at 28. Moreover, Defendant contends the subject matter of their testimony goes "to the very core of a patent case." Id. Defendant identifies four non-party witnesses who have "knowledge about the alleged infringement, the accused product and related sales and financial information, and invalidity and non-infringement defenses." Doc. 30 at 14. Plaintiff, on the other hand, contends that non-party witnesses such as employees of Window World of Tallahassee and Folkers Window Company in Pensacola, Florida, have relevant information and "may require the ability of the court to compel the attendance of the witness in order to obtain specifics regarding the nature of the products sold and documentation regarding the sales." Doc. 12 at 17-18. It is unknown, however, how many non-party witnesses Plaintiff would call. Nevertheless, courts should not merely tally the number of witnesses to make that determination. See Carroll, 910 F.Supp.2d at 1335 ; Dale v. United States, 846 F.Supp.2d 1256 , 1257 (M.D. Fla. 2012) (noting that the court "will not simply 'tally the number of witnesses' in each prospective forum to determine which is more convenient"). It is also unknown how significant Plaintiff's witnesses from the Florida businesses would be as to the ultimate issue of whether Plaintiff's patent has been infringed. The Florida witnesses appear relevant to the issue of sales which may be established through the documentary evidence. Defendant Oehme has specified that the four non-party witnesses have knowledge relevant to the merits of this case and, as case law has established, "the majority of the witnesses in a patent infringement case originate [*13] with the defendant . . . ." Brandywine Commc'ns Tech., LLC v. Cisco Systems, Inc., No. 6:11cv1843, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68317 , 2012 WL 8281188 , at *4 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 26, 2012). Here, this factor weighs in Defendant's favor as California will be more convenient to the potential witnesses.
A related issue is which nonparty witnesses may be compelled to attend a trial in this matter. Because California witnesses are beyond this Court's subpoena power (100-mile limit imposed in Rule 45(b)(2)(C)), and Florida witnesses are beyond the California court's power, this factor is neutral. It is unknown from either party whether any of the witnesses would voluntarily testify, whether deposition testimony would be sufficient, or the like. Without such information, this factor cannot weigh in either party's favor.
Another factor to be considered is the convenience of the parties. One party will be required to travel whether the case remains here or is transferred. As this case now stands, this factor is neutral.
The parties, not surprisingly, disagree on the locus of operative facts in this case. Oehme asserts that a "defendant's place of business" is the preferred forum because it "usually constitutes the 'center of gravity of the alleged patent infringement.' " Doc. 10 at 25. Oehme states that because all "products are designed, manufactured, and inventoried" in California, the "hub of the activity concerning infringement," the case should be transferred to California. Doc. 30 at 16-20; doc. 10 at 25-26. Plaintiff asserts that the operative facts are where a patent is actually infringed, which Plaintiff contends is in Florida. Doc. 32-1 at 15. Plaintiff argues that because "the patent infringement was committed in Florida and resulted in injury within Florida," the focus of the claim should be on the "relevant sales and shipment of the infringing products to the installation companies and the distribution of the accused products to end users."  Id. at 15-16.
"[I]n a patent-infringement case, the "design, development, marketing, manufacture, and sale" of the accused products will often be the primary issues for litigation." Carroll, 910 F.Supp.2d at 1340 . This is often referred to as "the center of gravity" and, usually, the location of these operative facts "lies where the allegedly infringing product was designed, developed, and produced."  Id. at 1339-40. While the parties have presented stipulated evidence showing that sales occurred in Florida, that carries little weight on the issue of venue because sales have occurred nationwide. Brandywine Commc'ns Tech., 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68317 , 2012 WL 8281188 , at *3, citing In re Acer America Corp., 626 F.3d 1252 , 1256 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (ordering district court to transfer action to Northern District of California, where the allegedly infringing products were researched, designed, developed and tested);  In re Hoffman—La Roche Inc., 587 F.3d 1333 , 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (ordering district court to transfer action to the Eastern District of North Carolina, where the accused drug was developed and tested). Furthermore, "courts agree that the center of gravity of the accused activity in a patent infringement case is 'where the marketing and sales decisions occurred, not just the location of any particular sales [*14] activity.' " Trace-Wilco, Inc. v. Symantec Corp., No. 08-80877, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13646 , 2009 WL 455432 , at *2-3 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 23, 2009) (internal marks omitted), quoted in Endotach LLC v. Cook Medical Inc., No. 3:12cv307-MCR, doc. 50 at 5. While sales have occurred in Florida, sales decisions were made in California. Accordingly, this factor weighs in Defendant's favor and this Court should follow the well established rule that the preferred forum in patent cases is the Defendant's place of business which usually constitutes the "center of gravity." In re World Wide Medical Tech. LLC., 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 52071 , 2012 WL 1252423 , at *2.
Another factor considers the location of relevant documents and access to proof. Oehme contends that in patent cases, "the bulk of the relevant evidence usually comes from the accused infringer and, as such, the place where Oehme's documents are kept weight in favor of transfer" to California. Doc. 10 at 21. While Plaintiff submits the focus of this case "is the sale and distribution of the infringing products," doc. 12 at 18, the relevant documents in the stipulated evidence appear to have come from Defendant in reporting those sales. See doc. 32-1 at 14. Case law recognizes that "[i]n patent infringement cases, the bulk of the relevant evidence usually comes from the accused infringer." Carroll, 910 F.Supp.2d at 1339 . "Consequently, the place where the defendant's documents are kept weighs in favor of transfer to that location." Id. (other citations omitted); In re World Wide Medical Tech. LLC., 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 520712012 WL 1252423, at *2 (N.D. Fla. Apr. 13, 2012) (noting that although documents can easily "be scanned and made available through electronic discovery, this factor is slightly in favor of transfer"). This factor weighs in Defendants' favor as the majority of the relevant documents will be in California.
Plaintiff's choice of forum is in the Northern District of Florida which includes Monticello, Florida, where Plaintiff's business is located. See doc. 28 at 12. Plaintiff's "choice of forum should not be disturbed unless it is clearly outweighed by other considerations." Robinson v. Giarmarco & Bill, P.C., 74 F.3d 253 (11th Cir. 1996); Carroll, 910 F.Supp.2d at 1333 (noting a plaintiff's "choice of venue is 'entitled to considerable weight and should not be disturbed unless other factors weigh strongly in favor of transfer.' ")(quoting Neil Bros. Ltd. v. World Wide Lines, Inc., 425 F.Supp.2d 325 , 333 (E.D.N.Y. 2006). In this case, Plaintiff's forum choice is outweighed by the other considerations.
Several of the other factors should be considered neutral. There is nothing upon which to base the relative means of the parties and, because neither party is a large corporate entity, this factor is neutral. It is presumed that federal courts in both Florida and California are sufficiently familiar with patent law to render that factor neutral as well. See Microspherix LLC v. Biocompatibles, Inc., 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8359 , 2012 WL 243764 , at *5 (S.D. Fla. Jan. 25, 2012). It is also presumed that as to trial efficiency, neither court would tip the scale one way or the other.
In the interests of justice, based on the totality of the circumstances and after weighing the factors, this case should be transferred to the Central District of California for all further proceedings. Of the nine [*15] factors discussed above, five are neutral and three weigh in Defendant's favor. The only factor that potentially could weigh in Plaintiff's favor, choice of forum, does not do so in this case because it is outweighed by other factors. The motion to transfer venue, doc. 10, should be granted and this case transferred to California pursuant 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) .
In light of the foregoing, it is respectfully RECOMMENDED that Defendant Oehme's motion to dismiss, doc. 10, for lack of personal jurisdiction be DENIED, but the motion to transfer venue pursuant 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) , doc. 10, be GRANTED, and this case TRANSFERRED to the Central District of California for all further proceedings.

Defendant Oehme's response asserts that after sending 9909 mailers, "only 176" were in Florida, and "this mailing campaign did not yield much fruit as only 14 FL addressees ever became customers . . . ." Doc. 30 at 6. To support that statement, Oehme cites to S.E. at 58-77, yet the beginning point for that comment is the total 9909 mailers sent. The list of total mailers to all states is not provided in the Stipulated Evidence (S.E.), but in Exhibit A, attached to counsel's declaration, doc. 31. Furthermore, in the declaration, doc. 31, it is stated that 640 businesses in Florida were sent mailers. Review of the Florida addresses provided in the parties' stipulated evidence, however, and cited by Defendant Oehme, reveals that mailers were sent to 687 Florida addresses. S.E. at 28, 58-77. Furthermore, that list shows Oehme has 17 current clients, see S.E. at 58-59, not just 14 as stated in the response, doc. 30.

The Supreme Court has listed the following factors as relevant to the consideration of reasonableness:
'[T]he burden on the defendant,' 'the forum State's interest in adjudicating the dispute,' 'the plaintiff's interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief,' 'the interstate judicial system's interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies,' and the 'shared interest of the several States in furthering fundamental substantive social policies.'

WILLIAM P. DIMITROULEAS 
FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
THIS CAUSE is before the Court on the non-jury trial conducted from July 21, 2014, to July 24, 2014, where the Court considered the complaint brought by Relators Manuel Christiansen ("Christiansen") and Brian Ashton ("Ashton") and together with Christiansen, ("Relators" or "Plaintiffs") on behalf of the United States and the State of Florida against Defendant Everglades College, Inc. d/b/a Keiser University ("Keiser"). See [DE 286]. The Court received testimony from Armando Ortiz, Arthur Keiser, Sherri Olsen, William Searle, Rhonda Fuller, Sabrina Mohammed, Brian Woods, Peter Crocitto, Jason Delisle, and Antonio Argiz. The Court has considered the exhibits admitted into evidence and the arguments of counsel and has determined the credibility of witnesses. The Court has also considered Defendant's July 25, 2014 Post-Trial Brief [DE-313], Relators' July 30, 2014 Corrected Post-Trial Submission [DE-316], and the Government's August 6, 2014 Statement of Interest [DE-317].
Pursuant to Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (the "Rules"), the Court shall now make its findings of fact and conclusions of law. The findings of fact are based on the preponderance of the evidence. To the extent that the findings of fact as stated may be deemed conclusions of law, they shall be considered conclusions of law. Similarly, to the extent the matters expressed as conclusions of law may be deemed findings of fact, they shall be considered findings of fact.
I. FINDINGS OF FACT 
1. This is a qui tam action originally filed pursuant to the False Claims Act (the "FCA"), 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729-3733 , and Florida False Claim Act (the "Florida FCA"), Fla. Stat. § 68.082(2)(a) , for the recovery of damages and civil penalties on behalf of the United States of America and the State of Florida. Relators, under the FCA and Florida FCA, have filed suit on behalf of the United States and the State of Florida.1 
2. Keiser [*2] is a non-profit corporation offering undergraduate and graduate programs for students on fourteen (14) campuses and through an online division. Keiser has employed approximately 1361 admissions counselors over the last seven (7) years.
3. Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (the "HEA"), 20 U.S.C. §§ 1070 et. seq. establishes various federal student loan and grant programs, including, but not limited to, the federal Pell Grant program, the Federal Family Education Loan Program, and the Federal Direct Student Loan Program (collectively, "Title IV Funding"). In order to matriculate at Keiser, many of Keiser's students receive Title IV Funding from the federal government. From 2006 through 2012, Keiser students received $1,288,162,457.97 in Title IV Funding. See [Plaintiffs' Exhibit 149].
4. The $1,288,162,457.97 consists of the following, see [Plaintiffs' Exhibit 149]:


• 2006 

○ Grants (not requiring repayment):
$21,108,919.41

5. To establish eligibility to receive Title IV Funding, Keiser executed Principal Participation Agreements (the "PPAs") with the federal government. Through the PPAs, Keiser certified, inter alia, the following:
It will not provide, nor contract with any entity that provides, any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or financial aid to any persons or entities engaged in any student recruiting or admission activities or in making decisions regarding the awarding of student financial assistance, except that this requirement shall not apply to the recruitment of foreign students residing in foreign countries who are not eligible to receive Federal Student Assistance.
6. Dr. Arthur Keiser ("Dr. Keiser"), Chancellor of Keiser University, executed PPAs on behalf of Keiser on the following dates, see [Plaintiffs' Exhibits 1-3]:
• April 16, 2007, for a period expiring on June 30, 2012;
• February 5, 2011, for a period expiring on February 28, 2011; and
• August 9, 2011, for a period expiring on June 30, 2014.
7. Dr. Keiser executed electronic certifications (the "Electronic Certifications") on November 8, 2006; March 10, 2007; March 24, 2008; April 13, 2009; February 9, 2010; and August 12, 2011. See [Plaintiffs' Exhibits 4-9]. Those electronic certifications stated as follows:
I understand that if my institution provides false or misleading information, the U.S. Department of Education may deny the institution's request for eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs and/or revoke [*3] eligibility once it has been granted and (b) the institution may be liable for all federal student financial aid funds it or its students received. I also understand that I may be subject to a fine of not more than $25,000 or imprisonment of not more than five years, or both, for misinformation that is material to receipt and stewardship of federal student financial aid funds.
See [ id.].

8. From 2006 to 2012, Keiser participated in annual compliance audits (the "Compliance Audits") conducted by an independent auditor to determine whether Keiser was in compliance with the requirements for participating in federal student financial aid programs. See [Defendant's Exhibits 13-19]. For the audit covering the calendar year ending December 31, 2006, the auditor concluded as follows:
We have examined management's assertions, that The Keiser School, Inc., d/b/a Keiser University complied with the specified compliance requirements regarding Institutional Eligibility, Reporting [Pell Program: Pell Payment Data - via Electronic Data Exchange ("EDE"), Recipient Data Exchange C'RDE") or Floppy Disk Data Exchange ("FDDE") - or Recipient Financial Management System ("RFMS"); Loan Reporting: Direct Loan Servicing System ("DLSS"), and Student Status Confirmation Reports ("SSCR"); and for the Campus based programs: Fiscal Operations Report and Application to Participate ("FISAP")], Student Eligibility, Disbursements, Refunds/Return of Title IV Funds, GAPS and Cash Management, Perkins Loans, Administrative Capability listed in Section II of the U.S. Department of Education's Audit Guide, Audits of Federal Student Financial Assistance Programs at Participating Institutions and Institution Servicers, relative to participation in the Federal Student Financial Assistance Programs during the year ended December 31, 2006. Management is responsible for The Keiser School, Inc., d/b/a Keiser University's compliance with those requirements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on The Keiser School, Inc., d/b/a Keiser University's compliance based on our examination.
* * *
In our opinion, The Keiser School, Inc., d/b/a Keiser University complied, in all material respects, with the aforementioned requirements for the year ended December 31, 2006.
See [Defendant's Exhibit 13 at 17]. The audits for 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012 included the same conclusions. See [Defendant's Exhibits 14-19].

9. For each calendar year beginning in 2006 and ending in 2012, Keiser—through the PPAs, Electronic Certifications, and Compliance Audits—submitted claims to the United States government. Those claims were necessary for Keiser's receipt of federal student aid on behalf of Keiser's students.
10. As established by internal Keiser emails and by the testimony of Keiser employees Rhonda Fuller, Sherry Olsen, Sabrina Mohammed, and Peter Crocitto, Keiser provided gift cards, paid days off ("token days"), and meals to admissions counselors based on the number of student enrollments secured by those admissions counselors. The Court concludes that the gift cards, token days, and meals were [*4] not based on activity levels; they were incentives.
11. As a general proposition, it is possible that an admission counselor could have high activity levels (e.g. number of phone calls made, talk time, meetings, etc.) for a time period but obtain low enrollment numbers for that same time period. However, there is no credible evidence that any admissions counselor who had high activity levels but lower or average enrollment numbers received a gift card, token day, or meal. The gift cards, token days, and meals were, more likely than not, incentives based on the result of obtaining high enrollment numbers, without regard to the specific activities that produced enrollment numbers. Keiser employees' testimony that the gift cards, token days, and meals were based solely on activity levels, and not on enrollments, was not credible.
12. The practice of providing gift cards, token days, and/or meals to admissions counselors based on enrollment numbers took place on at least two Keiser campuses from 2006 to 2009. That practice was contrary to Keiser's official policy across all campuses. That practice led to the provision of miscellaneous enrollment-based incentives that did not exceed an aggregate value of a few thousand dollars.2 
13. Prior to November 20, 2009, Dr. Keiser and Keiser's top policymakers were aware that gift cards and meals were given to employees in some contexts. However, Dr. Keiser and Keiser's top policymakers were not aware of any practice of providing incentives—e.g., gift cards, token days, or meals—to admissions counselors based on enrollment numbers. At that time, therefore, Keiser had no knowledge of HEA violations arising from the improper provision of incentives to admissions counselors.3 
14. On or around November 20, 2009, Dr. Keiser and Keiser's top policymakers—through a letter from Kareem Edwards and an ensuing investigation—became aware that at least two Keiser campuses had provided gift cards, token days, and/or meals to admissions counselors as incentives for reaching enrollment goals. At that time, Keiser first had knowledge of internal violations of the HEA. Although some employees had knowledge of that practice prior to November 20, 2009, the knowledge was not sufficient to impute to Keiser until November 20, 2009.4 
15. In response, and to its credit, Keiser took measures to enforce its policies in order to end those violations. Those violations terminated.
16. Some of Keiser's PPAs, Electronic Certifications, and Compliance Audits up to November 20, 2009, falsely indicated to the government that Keiser had been in full compliance with all requirements for the receipt of Title IV Funding. As stated, however, Keiser had no knowledge of that falsity when submitting those materials to the government.
17. On February 9, 2010, Keiser—with knowledge of some HEA violations from 2006 to 2009—submitted an Electronic Certification that incorrectly communicated to the government that Keiser had been in compliance with all requirements for the receipt of Title IV Funding. On March 5, 2010, Keiser— with knowledge [*5] of some HEA violations from 2006 to 2009—submitted a Compliance Audit that incorrectly communicated to the government that Keiser had been in compliance with all requirements for the receipt of Title IV Funding for the year ending December 31, 2009. Perhaps, Keiser rationalized that since they had stopped the incentive program that no disclosure was warranted. However, the past indiscretions should have been revealed to the Government so that possible sanctions could have been considered. The failure to disclose the minor violations deprived the government of an opportunity to review the transgressions.
18. Keiser's February and March 2010 submissions to the government would not have been false or incorrect had Keiser disclosed its knowledge that, from 2006 through 2009, some admissions counselors had received gift cards, token days, cruises, spa days, and/or meals as incentives for meeting enrollment goals.
II. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 
19. The trial addressed the two remaining counts in this action: (1) Count I for Violation of Federal False Claims Act — HEA Title IV Funds; and (2) Count II for False Claim Through Promissory Fraud. The Court will first consider whether Defendant is liable under each count. The Court will then consider damages.
A. Liability Under Count I (Violation of Federal False Claims Act — HEA Title IV Funds) 
20. "To establish a cause of action under the [FCA], a relator must prove three elements: (1) a false or fraudulent claim; (2) which was presented, or caused to be presented, by the defendant to the United States for payment or approval; (3) with the knowledge that the claim was false." United States v. R&F Props. of Lake Cnty., Inc., 433 F.3d 1349 , 1355 (11th Cir. 2005). Some courts have identified four elements underlying FCA claims: "(1) the submission of a false claim; (2) scienter; (3) the false statement must be material to the government's decision to pay out moneys to the claimant; and (4) an actual claim or call on the government fisc." See United States ex rel. Gillespie v. Kaplan Univ., No. 09-20756-CIV, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 99093 , 2013 WL 3762445 , at *5 (S.D. Fla. July 16, 2013) (citing United States ex rel. Hendow v. Univ. of Phoenix, 461 F.3d 1166 , 1171-73 (9th Cir. 2006)). The Court finds that application of the three-element or four-element iteration will lead to the same holding. The Court will apply the four-element iteration in order to provide a more thorough analysis.
21. The first element requires evidence that an actual false claim was submitted to the government. See Klusmeier v. Bell Constructors, Inc., 469 F. App'x 718 , 721 (11th Cir. 2012). "A 'claim' [is] defined to include a request for money that is presented to an officer, employee or agent of the United States." United States ex rel. Mastej v. Health Mgmt. Assocs., Inc., No. 2:11-cv-89-FtM-29DNF, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37683 , 2013 WL 1149255 , at *6 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 19, 2013) (quoting 31 U.S.C. § 3729(b)(2)(A)(I) ).
22. The "knowledge" or "scienter" element requires a showing that the actor "'(1) has actual knowledge of the information; (2) acts in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the information; or (3) acts in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information, and no proof of specific intent to [*6] defraud is required.'" United States ex rel. Clausen v. Laboratory Corp. of Am., Inc., 290 F.3d 1301 , 1307 n.12 (11th Cir. 2002) (quoting 31 U.S.C. § 3729(b) ). Moreover, "[a] corporation can be held liable under the FCA even if the verifying employee was unaware of the wrongful conduct of other employees." United States v. Kaman Precision Prods., Inc., No. 6:09-cv-1911-Orl-31GJK, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97263 , 2011 WL 3841569 , at *5 (M.D. Fla. Aug. 30, 2011) (citing Grand Union Co. v. United States, 696 F.2d 888 (11th Cir. 1983)).
23. The "materiality" element is objective, requiring the fact-finder "to determine only whether the proven falsehoods have a 'natural tendency to influence, or be capable of influencing, the payment or receipt of money or property.'" United States ex rel. Feldman v. van Gorp, 697 F.3d 78 , 95 (2d Cir. 2012) (quoting 31 U.S.C. § 3729(b)(4) ). There is no requirement that a plaintiff or relator show that the defendant's false statement actually influenced the government's decision to pay money to the defendant. United States ex rel. Longhi v. United States, 575 F.3d 458 , 469 (5th Cir. 2009).
24. "There is a cause of action under the [FCA] when an institution executes a PPA, whereby, in order to be eligible for Title IV funds, it agrees to comply with certain statutory and regulatory requirements, including a ban on incentive compensation for student recruiters, and submits or causes to be submitted requests for funds when the institution is not in compliance with the statutory and regulatory requirements." United States ex rel. Gatsiopoulos v. Kaplan Career Inst., No. 09-21720-CIV, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135246 , 2010 WL 5392668 , at *3 (S.D. Fla. Dec. 22, 2010).
(1) The Submission of a False Claim 
25. As stated, supra, Keiser—through some of its PPAs, Electronic Certifications, and Compliance Audits addressing the 2006 to 2009 calendar years—submitted false information to the government. Keiser's submissions represented that Keiser had complied with all federal requirements for the receipt of Title IV Funding. Keiser, however, had violated the HEA by providing admissions counselors with incentives based on enrollment numbers. Thus, Keiser's failure to disclose its violations created a falsity in Keiser's submissions.
(2) Scienter/Knowledge of Falsity 
26. As stated, supra, the HEA violations became known5 to Keiser (either Dr. Keiser personally or Keiser University through the "Collective Knowledge Doctrine") as of November 20, 2009. Therefore, Keiser had no knowledge of the falsity of the PPA's, Electronic Certifications, and Compliance Audits submitted prior to November 20, 2009.
27. Keiser did have knowledge of the falsity of claims submitted to the government through the February 9, 2010, Electronic Certification and the March 5, 2010, Compliance Audit. Both submissions represented that Keiser, during the 2009 year at the very least, had not violated any federal requirements for the receipt of Title IV Funding. When making those submissions to the government, Keiser was aware that it had provided admissions counselors with incentives based on enrollment numbers from 2006 to November 20, 2009.
(3) Materiality 
28. The Electronic Certification and Compliance Audit [*7] were material to the government's decision to provide Title IV Funding to Keiser. An institution's compliance6 with the HEA and with the restrictions on the provision of incentives for enrollment numbers has a natural tendency to influence, or be capable of influencing, the government's payment of Title IV Funding to that institution. The government may not have provided any Title IV Funding if Keiser had not completed the PPAs, Electronic Certifications, and Compliance Audits. Moreover, the information conveyed through those documents—including the February 9, 2010, Electronic Certification and the March 5, 2010, Compliance Audit—had the natural tendency to influence the government's determinations as to whether to continue to provide Title IV Funding and the circumstances surrounding that Funding. More specifically, that information affected the government's decision as to Keiser's eligibility for Title IV Funding, the time period for which Keiser could receive Funding, whether Keiser should be investigated further before receiving Funding, whether Keiser must alter any practices before receiving Funding, whether Keiser must pay fines or penalties before receiving Funding, or whether Keiser must reimburse previous Funding before receiving additional Funding. However, the Court notes that Keiser has survived an Attorney General Investigation, a subpoena from the Office of Inspector General, and a 2012 Department of Education Compliance Review, none of which have affected Keiser's Title IV Funding.
29. Thus, Keiser's accurate completion of the February 9, 2010, Electronic Certification or the March 5, 2010, Compliance Audit would have the natural tendency to influence the government's decision(s) as to the circumstances or conditions surrounding Keiser's receipt of Title IV Funding. Consequently, Keiser's failure to disclose those violations in the February 9, 2010, Electronic Certification or the March 5, 2010, Compliance Audit created a falsity that was material to the government's decision to continue to provide Keiser with Title IV Funding.
(4) An Actual Claim or Call on the Government Fisc 
30. Keiser submitted PPAs, Electronic Certifications, and Compliance Audits to the government in order to receive Title IV Funding. The government required those documents and would not have remitted Title IV Funding without those documents.
31. The government did, in fact, remit $1,288,162,457.97 of Title IV Funding to Keiser as a result of Keiser submitting those documents. Therefore, those documents, coupled with the resulting receipt of Title IV funding, constituted an actual claim or call on the government fisc.
32. As stated, supra, two of those documents—the February 9, 2010, Electronic Certification and the March 5, 2010, Compliance Audit—were knowingly false when submitted by Keiser. And the information in those documents was material to the government's payment of Keiser's claims. The false information in those two documents came from Keiser.
33. Thus, on two (2) occasions only, Keiser knowingly [*8] submitted false and material claims to the government, resulting in an actual claim or call on the government fisc. Those two occasions constitute claims because they constituted conduct that caused the government to later pay out money. Unlike the relators in United States ex rel. Rostholder v. Omnicare, Inc., 745 F.3d 694 (4th Cir. 2014), the relators here have identified false statements. Keiser is liable under Count I for those two (2) submissions.
34. Finally, the FAFSAs submitted by students were not claims that were submitted or caused to be submitted by Keiser for the purposes of the FCA. Keiser does not control the number, content, or submission of FAFSAs. Students complete and submit FAFSAs at will. If a student submits to the government false information on a FAFSA in order to receive Title IV Funds, that student may be liable under the FCA. If an institution submits to the government false information through PPAs, Electronic Certifications, or Compliance Audits, that institution may be liable under the FCA. Institutions, however, cannot be liable for knowingly submitting or causing to be submitted false FAFSAs to the government where hundreds of thousands of students—without direct oversight by the institutions—control the content and submission of those claims. In any event, there was no testimony in this case that Keiser caused any student to submit a claim, never mind a false claim.7 
B. Liability Under Count II (False Claim Through Promissory Fraud) 
35. To succeed on an FCA claim premised on a promissory fraud theory, the plaintiff "must show that the 'promise' was false when made." United States ex rel. Parato v. Unadilla Health Care Center, Inc., 787 F. Supp. 2d 1329 , 1340 (M.D. Ga. 2011). "For a certified statement to be false under the Act, it must be an intentional, palpable lie. Innocent mistakes, mere negligent misrepresentations and differences in interpretations are not false certifications under the Act." United States ex rel. Hopper v. Anton, 91 F.3d 1261 , 1267 (9th Cir. 1996) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Ultimately, "under either the false certification theory or the promissory fraud theory, the essential elements of False Claims Act liability remain the same: (1) a false statement or fraudulent course of conduct, (2) made with scienter, (3) that was material, causing (4) the government to pay out money or forfeit moneys due." Hendow, 461 F.3d at 1174 .
36. As held at summary judgment, see [DE 194 at 8 n. 7], the Court does not find any material distinctions that warrant a separate analysis or conclusion under Count II. The February 9, 2010, Electronic Certification and the March 5, 2010, Compliance Audit were claims that included false promises that Keiser had been in full compliance with the HEA. Accordingly, for the reasons stated as to Count I, Keiser is liable under Count II. However, the damages in Counts I and II merge, as they are based on the same two transactions.
C. Damages 
37. "The FCA imposes two types of liability." United States v. Science Applications Int'l Corp., 626 F.3d 1257 , 1277 , 393 U.S. App. D.C. 223 (D.C. Cir. 2010). "First, a defendant who submits [*9] a false claim or makes a false statement to get a false claim paid is liable for civil penalties regardless of whether the government shows that the submission of that claim caused the government damages. Second, the defendant is liable for 3 times the amount of damages which the [g]overnment sustains because of the act of [the defendant]." Id. at 1277-78 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).
38. The civil penalty ranges from $5,500 to $11,000 for each of the false claims. See, e.g., United States v. Harris, 303 F. App'x 348 , 349 (7th Cir. 2008) (citing 31 U.S.C. § 3729(a)(1) ; 28 C.F.R. § 85.3(a)(9) ). "The False Claims Act, however, does not set any specific formula for imposing civil penalties, but authorizes federal trial courts to award monetary relief that will afford the [g]overnment a base civil penalty amount that can be adjusted, in the court's discretion, up to the statutory ceiling." Morse Diesel Int'l, Inc. v. United States, 79 Fed. Cl. 116 , 124 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Accordingly, courts must impose a civil penalty within the statutory range but have discretion in determining the penalty amount within that range. See id. ("Congress . . . afforded the federal trial courts considerable discretion in calculating damages and ascertaining the amount of the civil penalty component, within the statutory range.").
39. "In calculating FCA damages, the fact-finder seeks to set an award that puts the government in the same position as it would have been if the defendant's claims had not been false." Science Applications Int'l Corp., 626 F.3d at 1278 . Therefore, "the government must show not only that the defendant's false claims caused the government to make payments that it would have otherwise withheld, but also that the performance the government received was worth less than what it believed it had purchased." Id. at 1279 . Nevertheless, "the government will sometimes be able to recover the full value of payments made to the defendant, but only where the government proves that it received no value from the product delivered." Id. Thus, a fact finder, considering the relevant evidence, should calculate damages by first determining the amount the government paid because of a defendant's false claims and then subtracting the value the government nonetheless received from the defendant. See id. at 1277-80 .
(1) Civil Penalties 
40. Keiser knowingly submitted to the government two false claims leading to a call on the government fisc: the February 9, 2010, Electronic Certification and the March 5, 2010, Compliance Audit. The Court will exercise discretion and impose a civil penalty of $5,500.00 for each of those two claims, for a total civil penalty of $11,000.00.
(2) Actual Damages 
41. In calculating damages, the Court should determine what the government's financial position would have been had Keiser's February 9, 2010, Electronic Certification and the March 5, 2010, Compliance Audit been accurate. In order for those documents to have been accurate, Keiser would have needed to disclose that:
• contrary to its stated practices and policies, Keiser had discovered that from 2006 to November 20, 2009, some [*10] admissions counselors had received gift cards, token days, cruises, spa days, and/or meals based on meeting enrollment targets;
• the practice had involved the provision of a few thousand dollars of total incentives over that time period;
• Keiser had instructed that the practice cease immediately; and
• Keiser had no knowledge that the practice was continuing.
42. The relevant questions, therefore, are the following: (1) what actions would the government have taken vis-à-vis Keiser's Title IV Funding if Keiser had made those disclosures in February/March 2010; (2) what would the government's financial position be if it had taken those actions; and (3) how does that financial position compare to the government's current financial position? When answering these questions, the Court must consider the preponderance of the evidence presented at trial.

43. Relators urge the Court to conclude that the government would have withdrawn all Title IV Funding given to Keiser during the relevant time period. Relators' argument is straightforward. Full compliance with the HEA is mandatory for the receipt of Title IV Funding. Because Keiser was violating the HEA, it should not have received any Title IV grants or student loans for its students. According to Relators, therefore, the government's damages consist of all the money it lost by providing grants and student loans to Keiser students during the relevant time period. Relators suggest that the Court should treble that amount and then subtract a credit based on loan repayments recouped by the government.
44. The Court, however, declines to adopt Relators' theory of damages. The evidence does not establish that the government would have required reimbursement for or withdrawn all Title IV Funding for any time period had Keiser made the appropriate disclosures in February/March 2010. 45. When a school violates the HEA, the U.S. Department of Education (the "DOE") has discretion to take a variety of actions. See 34 C.F.R. § 668.81 (establishing regulations for actions where "an institution . . . violates any statutory provision of or applicable to Title IV of the HEA, any regulatory provision prescribed under that statutory authority, or any applicable special arrangement, agreement, or limitation entered into under the authority of statutes applicable to Title IV of the HEA."). Those actions include the following:
• an emergency action, through which the DOE—only after following enumerated procedures—may, inter alia, "[w]ithhold Title IV, HEA program funds from a participating institution or its students . . . or [w]ithdraw the authority of the institution . . . to commit, disburse, deliver, or cause the commitment, disbursement, or delivery of Title IV, HEA program funds except in accordance with a particular procedure," see 34 C.F.R. § 668.83(a) ;
• fine proceedings, through which the DOE—only after following enumerated procedures—may impose a fine of up to $27,500.00 per violation by an institution, see 34 C.F.R. § 668.84 ;
• suspension proceedings, through which the DOE—only after following enumerated procedures—may suspend [*11] an institution's participation in Title IV Funding, see 34 C.F.R. § 668.85 ; and
• limitation or termination proceedings, through which the DOE—only after following enumerated procedures—may limit or terminate an institution's participation in Title IV Funding, see 34 C.F.R. § 668.86 .
46. An institution subject to these proceedings could request a hearing before a final decision is made by the DOE as to fines, suspensions, limitations, or terminations. See 34 C.F.R. §§ 668.84-668.91 .

47. If Keiser had submitted accurate disclosures after November 20, 2009—when Keiser first had knowledge of its internal HEA violations relating to incentives for admissions counselors—the DOE could have chosen to initiate any one of these available actions or proceedings. The actions or proceedings may have led to various resolutions ranging from a fine to a temporary suspension to a full suspension to the imposition of a particular procedure for Keiser to follow in order to continue to receive Title IV Funding. Additionally, the DOE could have sought a reimbursement of all Title IV Funding provided to Keiser from 2006 through February/March 2010. See [Plaintiffs' Exhibits 4-9].
48. There was no evidence at trial that the DOE would have attempted to suspend Keiser, fully terminate Keiser's Title IV Funding, or seek reimbursement for the Title IV Funding already received by Keiser. Similarly, there was no evidence that the DOE would have succeeded in obtaining any of those remedies.
49. Indeed, it is notable that the government has been aware of Relators' allegations since February 1, 2012. See [DE 1]. The government was free to intervene in this action but did not do so. The DOE—subject to any applicable statute(s) of limitations—has been capable of initiating proceedings pursuant to 34 C.F.R. § 668.83 to address Keiser's HEA violations; however, there is no evidence that the DOE has taken any action. The government's conduct thus far has in no way indicated that, had Keiser disclosed its HEA violations, the government would have withdrawn or sought reimbursement for any portion of the $1,288,162,457.97 of Title IV Funding received by Keiser.8 
50. Thus, the Court, in light of the available evidence at trial, cannot conclude that the government's financial position now is any worse than its financial position would have been had Keiser disclosed the existence of the HEA violations as of February/March 2010.9 Consequently, the Court finds that Relators have proven no actual damages arising from Keiser's submissions of false claims to the government through the February 9, 2010, Electronic Certification and the March 5, 2010, Compliance Audit.
51. Furthermore, even if the evidence established that the government would have terminated Keiser's eligibility for additional Title IV Funding, the Court cannot conclude that the government has incurred financial damage by failing to implement that termination.
52. First, if the government had withdrawn Keiser's Title IV Funding, the affected students may have chosen to attend other schools that were eligible for Title [*12] IV Funding. As Mr. Argiz testified, there is no showing that the Department of Education would have denied any of the loans. The government would have then provided Title IV Funding for those students, despite Keiser's loss of eligibility. In other words, Title IV loans and grants follow students. Therefore, the government would have saved money only if the students that would have attended Keiser either attended cheaper Title IV-eligible institutions or declined to attend any other Title IV-eligible institutions. There is no evidence establishing either scenario.
53. Second, the evidence at trial suggested that the government, through the Federal Credit Reform Act, treats federal student loans as profitable. Plaintiffs' expert, Mr. Delisle,10 provided testimony that the Congressional Budget Office—pursuant to the official calculation method mandated by the Federal Credit Reform Act—reports that federal student loans issued over the 2013-2023 period would result in $184 billion in net earnings to the government. Federal grants, however, do result in direct losses for the government.
54. It is unclear from the evidence at trial whether the combination of Title IV loans and grants issued by the government to Keiser students for any time period from 2009 to 2013 have resulted in an overall net financial loss or gain for the government. The government may actually be in a stronger financial position now than it would have been had it suspended Title IV Funding from Keiser for any time period.
55. For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that the government has not suffered any financial damage as a result of the two (2) false claims submitted by Keiser in 2010. The evidence did not establish that, had those claims been accurate, the government would have sought or succeeded in obtaining a full reimbursement for previously disbursed Title IV Funding. The evidence did not establish that, had those claims been accurate, the government would have sought or obtained a suspension or termination of subsequent Title IV Funding. Finally, the evidence did not establish that a suspension or termination of subsequent Title IV Funding would have benefitted the government financially. The evidence showed that Title IV Funding may have followed students to other institutions. The evidence also showed that the government officially reports that it earns profits on federal student loans. Because the evidence did not establish that the government incurred any actual financial loss, no actual damages shall be awarded to the government.
III. CONCLUSION 
Based on the foregoing findings of fact and conclusions of law, the Court holds as follows:
(a) Plaintiffs prevail on Counts I and II;
(b) The Defendant is liable for a civil penalty in the amount of $11,000;
(c) Defendant is not liable for any actual damages;
(d) The Court makes no current ruling with respect to attorneys' fees and costs, and the parties may file any timely and appropriate motions as to those issues; and
(e) A separate Rule 58(a) Judgment will follow.

DONE AND ORDERED[*13] in Chambers at Fort Lauderdale, Broward County, Florida, this 14th day of August, 2014.

The FCA provides the United States with at least sixty (60) days to determine whether to intervene in the action and take over the litigation or to decline intervention and allow the Relators to prosecute the action. See [DE 22 at 2] (citing 31 U.S.C. §§ 3730(b)(2) and (b)(4)). On August 9, 2012, the Court issued an Order [DE 14] allowing the United States and the State of Florida until September 12, 2012, to determine whether to intervene. On September 12, 2012, the United States filed a notice indicating that it would not intervene. [DE 15]. The State of Florida did not file any notice and, by default, declined to intervene.

fn 
2
The preponderance of the evidence did not establish any reliable total value of the incentives.

fn 
3
To the extent that Plaintiffs, through the testimony of Armando Ortiz, complain about Magistrate Judge Snow's limitations on their ESI discovery, the Court notes that no appeal was taken to this Court.

fn 
4
The Court finds that buying lunch for the whole teams (including admissions counselors) that achieved thirty (30) enrollments constituted an incentive. Likewise, the gift cards, token days, and cruises amount to incentives given to the admissions counselors.

fn 
5
The Court finds no evidence of deliberate ignorance or a reckless disregard for the truth.

fn 
6
The Court is sympathetic to a university's ability to comply with each of the 402 subparts of the law.

fn 
7
The Court is likewise uncomfortable classifying the submissions for Pell Grants as claims. Even if the Court did make that classification, it is unclear how many submissions were actually made by Keiser to obtain Pell Grants.

fn 
8
The Court is not impressed with Keiser's contention that an adverse ruling is or should be tantamount to a civil death penalty.

fn 
9
If this civil suit had never been brought but the Department of Education had conducted administrative proceedings and had reached the same findings about HEA violations and false claims as the findings herein, there is no indication that the result as to damages and penalties levied on Keiser would have been any different.

fn 
10
Mr. Delisle is not a CPA, but has a graduate degree in Public Policy. He had never before computed damages and could give only rough estimates, which were contrary to Mr. Argiz's testimony, which was given to a reasonable degree of accounting probability. However, with a different witness, there may have been a different conclusion on the profitability of loans.

LURANA S. SNOW, UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE.

LURANA S. SNOW 
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
THIS CAUSE is before the Court on the Plaintiff's Motion for Extraordinary Relief (ECF No. 260 ), which was referred to United States Magistrate Judge Lurana S. Snow for a Report and Recommendation. The motion is ripe for consideration and an evidentiary hearing was held before the undersigned on May 15, and 16, 2014.
I. RELEVANT PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND BACKGROUND 
This is an action for unauthorized access, misuse and permanent deletion of files from the Plaintiff's computers in violation of the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), misappropriation of trade secrets in violation of Florida's Uniform Trade Secrets Act (FUTSA), unfair trade practices in violation of Florida's Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (FDUTPA), tortious interference with business relations, conversion, conspiracy, unjust enrichment, and breach of employee duty of loyalty. (ECF No 125)
Lighthouse List Company, LLC ("Lighthouse") is in the business of providing target list marketing and direct response marketing services in Florida and nationwide. The services include direct marketing on the internet; postal, telemarketing, e-mail marketing; supplying telemarketing data, and list management services.
Defendant, Cross Hatch Ventures ("Cross Hatch") is a competitor. Steve McFadden ("McFadden") is a former employee of Lighthouse who, according to Lighthouse, formed Cross Hatch during his employment with Lighthouse. According to Lighthouse, McFadden and Betsy Resnick, a co-defendant1, conspired with each other while still employed by Lighthouse to develop a competing business. Lighthouse alleges that the Defendants used Lighthouse's confidential and proprietary information to steal Lighthouse's clients, business know-how and opportunities.
McFadden resigned from Lighthouse on February 5, 2013. On February 7, 2013, Lighthouse, through counsel, sent a cease and desist letter to McFadden which demanded that McFadden cease using Lighthouse's confidential and proprietary information and return the laptop computer he used while employed [*2] at Lighthouse, along with all data stored within it. On March 6, 2013, Lighthouse filed its Verified Complaint for Injunctive Relief and Damages (ECF No. 1), and an Emergency Motion for ex parte Temporary Restraining Order, in which Lighthouse sought the immediate preservation of all of McFadden's electronic devices. (ECF No. 6) On March 19, 2014, Lighthouse's digital data forensic expert ("DDFE") imaged each of the electronic devices identified by McFadden, including three laptops and an Apple iPhone 5.
On April 2, 2013, the Court entered the parties' Agreed Order on Plaintiff's Motion for Temporary Injunction, which, among other things, enjoined McFadden and Cross Hatch from destroying any and all information, data, and documents, whether in electronic form or otherwise that are potentially relevant to Lighthouse's claims. (ECF No. 30, ¶6)
On June 10, 2013, Lighthouse propounded its First Request for Production of Documents and First Set of Interrogatories to the Defendants. Request for Production number 4, which was directed to McFadden and Cross Hatch, required the production of all documents related to communications between McFadden and Cross Hatch and any employees of Lighthouse during the year after McFadden left his employment with Lighthouse. Interrogatory number 5 to McFadden and Interrogatory number 7 to Cross Hatch asked McFadden and Cross Hatch to identify all communications between them and any current and former Lighthouse employees.
On June 20, 2013 the parties submitted a Stipulation Regarding Search Protocol for Electronically Stored Information (ECF No. 80), which the Court approved on June 24, 2014. (ECF No. 85)
On July 3, 2013, McFadden and Cross Hatch served responses to Lighthouse's discovery requests. On July 30, 2013, Lighthouse filed motions to compel seeking better responses from both McFadden and Cross Hatch. (ECF Nos. 95 and 96)
On August 13, 2013, counsel for McFadden and Cross Hatch received a hard drive from the DDFE containing a privileged set of documents, as well as responsive documents, based upon the agreed upon search protocol. Pursuant to the parties' agreement, the Defendants were to review the files, and within five days, direct the DDFE to remove non-responsive or privileged documents prior to producing the remainder to Lighthouse. On September 9, 2013, Lighthouse filed a motion to compel the immediate release of the electronically stored information ("ESI"). (ECF No. 128)
At the October 8, 2013 hearing on Lighthouse's motions to compel, the Defendants argued that all information responsive to Lighthouse's discovery requests could be found within the documents located within the imaged data. The data had not, however, been released to Lighthouse as of the date of the hearing. The Court overruled McFadden and Cross Hatch's objections to Request for Production 4, and also overruled their objections to Interrogatories 5 and 7. The Court then ordered the Defendants to produce responsive documents on or before October 16, 2013. (ECF No. 162). On October 18, 2013, the Court granted the Defendants [*3] an extension of time to comply. (ECF No. 168)
On October 24, 2013, Cross Hatch served an Amended/Supplemental Answers/Better Answers to the First Set of Interrogatories in which Cross Hatch identified Jason Fuller as a Lighthouse employee with whom McFadden had contact after McFadden left Lighthouse. Specifically, Cross Hatch stated:
Jason Fuller contacted Steve McFadden via Linked In to understand his departure. Mr. McFadden explained to him that there was no data to sell at Lighthouse, he'd had many broken promises and it was time for him to go on his own. He does not remember specific times or dates.

Lighthouse filed the instant motion after discovering that Cross Hatch had failed to disclose a significant number of text messages2 exchanged between McFadden and Mr. Fuller between February 20, 2013 and March 15, 2013, in which Mr. Fuller had revealed the substance and/or contents of e-mail communications between Lighthouse and its attorneys.3 Lighthouse believes communications between McFadden and Fuller continued until at least December of 2013. Lighthouse does not know whether McFadden shared any of the information he obtained from Fuller with his former counsel, or with his new attorney who entered his appearance on November 15, 2013. (ECF Nos. 179 and 180).
Lighthouse requested an evidentiary hearing to determine the scope of the damage and the appropriate remedy, which it asserts may include: 1) a finding that the Defendants have knowingly and willfully violated the Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction, 2) a finding that Defendants have knowingly and willfully engaged in discovery misconduct, 3) consideration of whether Defendants' pleadings should be stricken, 4) consideration of whether Defendants' counsel should be disqualified, and 5) consideration of whether financial or other sanctions should be ordered.
The Defendants argue that, to the extent that Lighthouse is asserting a discovery violation, the motion is untimely. Lighthouse discovered the text messages prior to McFadden's March 12, 2014 deposition, but did not file the instant motion until May 6, 2014. According to the Defendants, Lighthouse could have questioned McFadden about the texts during the deposition, but chose not to do so. The Defendants also argue that the text messages appear to disclose the facts underlying privileged communications, rather than the privileged communications themselves, and that in any event, Fuller, who should be deemed a member of Lighthouse corporate management, waived the privilege. The Defendants represent that they have now produced e-mails between McFadden and Fuller which Lighthouse asserts had not been produced earlier. According to the Defendants, they believed that these e-mails had been included in the prior production, and if not included, they were not omitted willfully.
II. EVIDENCE PRESENTED 
Lighthouse called Defendant Steve McFadden as its first witness. McFadden testified that he had not ceased communicating with Jason Fuller on March 19, 2013, andthat [*4] Mr. Fuller occasionally would phone him. He could not recall when he and Mr. Fuller ceased exchanging text messages, but admitted to deleting all text messages with Fuller from his cell phone sometime around the summer of 2013. McFadden explained he had no reason to keep the text messages because, in his view, everything had been captured in the March 19, 2013 forensic image, and the texts were taking up memory on his phone. He explained that, to his knowledge, no text messages were deleted that had not been included in the forensic capture, but later McFadden said he was not certain that there were no texts with Fuller after March 19, 2013. McFadden stated that he and Fuller did not exchange e-mails after March 19, 2013.
McFadden admitted that he swore to Cross Hatch's Amended Supplemental Answers to Lighthouse's First Set of Interrogatories. In particular, he conceded that he swore to Cross Hatch's answer to Interrogatory 7. McFadden explained that the response does not disclose the existence of the text messages because, in October of 2013 when he provided the supplemental answer, he had forgotten about them. McFadden testified that although his supplemental answers were not complete, he did the best he could while laboring under a court deadline4.
McFadden admitted to meeting with Fuller in February 2013, and with Fuller and Betsy Resnick sometime after March 2013. He stated that he met with Betsy Resnick frequently, and could not explain why he had not disclosed this in the interrogatory answers, other than to state that he thought he had done so.5 He also testified that he continued to communicate by phone with Mr. Fuller until sometime in the last quarter of 2013.
McFadden related that the text messages between himself and Fuller accurately reveal that on February 20, 2013, he and Fuller scheduled an "off the record" meeting at a McDonald's restaurant. He did not recall whether they discussed Fuller securing a new cell phone number, but admitted that future text messages from Fuller, which commenced the following day, came from a different telephone number. Fuller and McFadden discussed the fact that Lighthouse was planning to file a lawsuit against McFadden. They also discussed McFadden's reasons for leaving Lighthouse, and Fuller's dismay upon being told that McFadden had quit because of him.
The former co-workers discussed purported lies that had been told to Fuller, and their mutual unfavorable opinion about McFadden's former employer. McFadden characterized this and other communications with Fuller as "gossip," and stated that initially, he was not sure whether Fuller was acting as an agent of Lighthouse or as his friend. He did not know whether he could trust Mr. Fuller, and worried that Mr. Fuller might be setting him up. As time went on, McFadden and Fuller restored their friendship, and their conversations dwelled less upon work. McFadden estimated that between February 2013 and December 2013, he spoke to Mr. Fuller approximately once a month. At some point, McFadden stopped receiving telephone calls [*5] from Fuller.
McFadden admitted that the text messages also accurately reveal that Fuller advised him to take steps to impede Lighthouse's ability to trace any data McFadden may have taken from Lighthouse. He conceded that he understood what Fuller was advising him to do, and concedes that he asked how much time he had to do it, but ultimately had not acted on Fuller's advice.
McFadden explained that his February 25, 2013 text message to a friend, stating that he had spoken to an attorney and was told that Lighthouse would have to take him to court to get his laptop, had not been prompted by any information provided to him by Fuller. Instead, the message was the result of the February 7, 2013 cease and desist letter he had received which demanded that he turn the laptop over to Lighthouse. McFadden had not yet retained counsel, but did bring up the subject up at a party in casual conversation with his friend, who was the corporate attorney for his former company.
McFadden admitted that the text messages also correctly reflect that he had asked Fuller if Lighthouse was planning to sue Betsy Resnick. Fuller responded affirmatively, and told McFadden that he "[r]ead injunction last night," and that Lighthouse was going to allege that McFadden and Resnick were working together. Lighthouse also was planning to go after their personal computers. McFadden testified that he relayed this information to Ms. Resnick, but did nothing else with it. McFadden also admitted that Fuller revealed to him in a text message that Lighthouse's lawyers had advised that there was nothing wrong with McFadden competing against Lighthouse because the parties did not have a non-compete agreement in force. Fuller also told McFadden that Lighthouse's attorneys advised Lighthouse not to respond to McFadden's letter about commissions. McFadden stated that he did not know how Fuller had obtained the information, and that he already knew that he did not have a non-compete agreement with Lighthouse. McFadden explained that everyone had access to Mark Traverso's6 e-mail inbox, including Fuller in his capacity as IT manager. Further, McFadden testified that Mr. Traverso walks around and talks about such things all the time.
McFadden conceded that he received a text message from Fuller advising him to make a backup DVD of his Ameribase e-mail messages, then put his laptop in a safety deposit box. Fuller further suggested that McFadden get a new laptop and advise the court that he had gotten rid of the old one in order to be totally finished with Lighthouse. McFadden testified that he had not solicited Fuller's advice, and although he responded "ok," to the text, he did not take Fuller's suggestion. McFadden stated that he did not remember making a copy of his Ameribase e-mails, although he did make copies of items periodically because he recently had experienced a computer crash and wanted to back up his data.7 
McFadden also acknowledged that Fuller initiated a March 14, 2013 text in which Fuller asked McFadden if he had made the DVD. McFadden responded that [*6] he had not gotten a new computer. Fuller stressed that McFadden should at least create the backup DVD of his Ameribase e-mails because a forensic person would be visiting Lighthouse the following day, and McFadden thanked him.
McFadden also agreed that when Fuller asked him if he was available to talk the next day, he instructed Fuller to phone him. A telephone conversation lasting nearly forty minutes ensued. McFadden could not recall the specifics of the conversation.
McFadden stated that Lighthouse had not asked him about the Fuller texts during McFadden's March 2014 deposition, and that he did not see the iPhone 5 report until at least one week after the third day of his deposition.
McFadden refused to answer any questions about communications with his attorneys, including advice he may have received from them, invoking his attorney-client privilege.
Jason Fuller testified next. He stated that he currently is employed by Lighthouse and that Mark Traverso is his supervisor. He described his job responsibilities as managing data bases, administering e-mail for his team, and occasionally fixing computers. On the advice of his counsel, Fuller invoked his rights under the Fifth Amendment , and refused to answer all other questions, including when he stopped exchanging text messages with Mr. McFadden, whether he has had any communications of any kind with McFadden in 2014, and whether McFadden told Fuller he was sharing the information Fuller provided to him with McFadden's attorneys.
Lighthouse next called Mark Traverso. Mr. Traverso testified that he maintains two e-mail addresses. The older of the two accounts was with AOL, and was established eighteen years ago when there were no domain names available for companies. The newer account uses the domain "Lighthouse List." A password is required to access the AOL account. According to Mr. Traverso, it was well known at Lighthouse that Mr. Fuller, as head of the IT department, had password access to his in-box. Mr. Traverso's assistant, Matthew Kowalski, also has password access to Mr. Traverso's e-mail accounts. Two other IT employees, Amy Newman and Jimmy Nasso might have been provided with Mr. Traverso's password when both Mr. Traverso and Mr. Kowalski were away.
Mr. Traverso testified that after examining the McFadden/Fuller text messages and comparing them to a screen capture of all e-mails between himself and Lighthouse's counsel8 during February and March 2013, he was able to identify multiple instances where Mr. Fuller relayed information to McFadden which had been obtained directly from the attorney-client e-mails.9 As an example, Mr. Traverso referred to an e-mail from Toby Milgram, a Lighthouse employee, that he forwarded to Lori Adelson on February 26, 2013. The text of that e-mail was cut and pasted directly into a February 27, 2013 text message from Fuller to McFadden. (Plaintiff's Exhibit 6, and ECF No. 260-2, p.8) The string of texts includes Mr. Fuller's advice to McFadden to "[t]ell Betsy not to talk to or trust Tobi. She's bad mouthing both of y'all to the big boy." (ECF No. 260-[*7] 2, p. 8). Mr. Traverso testified that he found at least six similar instances of copying by Fuller.
According to Mr. Traverso, the first indication from the text messages that Fuller was sharing information with McFadden was on February 22, 2014, when Fuller told McFadden that McFadden's laptop had been a topic of discussion with the lawyers, and advised McFadden to "[p]repare in case they try to force u to return through court...I'll keep you posted."  Id. at 9.
Mr. Traverso further testified that on March 4, 2013, a message from counsel was delivered to his AOL account which included a draft copy of the complaint and motion for injunctive relief. On the same day, Fuller asked McFadden, "[y]ou get your atty yet? Their (sic) finalizing fact sheet for injunction today. . . ." Fuller followed with another text stating, "saying you sent ksg files from your personal email."  Id. at 7. On March 5, 2013, Fuller texted McFadden stating that he "...[r]ead injunction last nite. Trying to say u 2 are working together. Also trying to go after both of your personal/home computers...."  Id. at 6. According to Mr. Traverso, all of this information had been taken directly from e-mails between himself and counsel.
On March 8, 2013, Fuller advised McFadden "[t]hey also got your letter about commissions but atty told them bot (sic) to respond. Atty said they served you with legal papers. Make sure u get good atty." When McFadden told Fuller he had not been served, Fuller responded, "[s]ays served on march 7 2013 1:45pm cross hatch registered agent spiegel & ultrera . . . ."  Id. at 4-5.
Mr. Traverso also identified an instance on March 11, 2013 in which Fuller had texted McFadden and stated that the "[c]ourt issued an injunction to prevent you from destroying and/or deleting data from the laptop. Did you get served with that notice yet?" On the same date, Fuller asked McFadden, "[w]ho is Betsy talking or bragging to? I read that she bragged to somebody over the weekend that the papers were sent to the wrong address. . . ."  Id. at 3-4.
Mr. Traverso testified that he believed the last instance of copying occurred on March 14, 2013 when Fuller sent a text to McFadden stating simply, "Bluhm?"  Id. at p. 2. According to Mr. Traverso, he had e-mailed attorney Lori Adelson after receiving a telephone call from an attorney named Bluhm, asking if Ms. Adelson knew who he was. Mr. Fuller continued the text exchange by reporting to McFadden that "[t]hey're getting scared thinking you're counter-suing!!" Id. According to Mr. Traverso, that information also came directly from his e-mail exchange with Ms. Adelson. On the same day, Fuller advised McFadden that, "[t]hey have a forensics guy coming here tomorrow . . . ."  Id. at 1.
According to Mr. Traverso, all of the information relayed by Fuller to McFadden had been taken directly from e-mail communications between him and his counsel. Furthermore, these emails addressed issues which Mr. Traverso had never discussed with Fuller. Mr. Traverso emphasized that he had not authorized Fuller to review his e-mails and share the information with McFadden. He stated that he did not learn that Fuller had provided information to McFadden until about six weeks [*8] prior to the hearing. As soon as he discovered the invasion, he changed his passwords. He described Mr. Fuller's current status with Lighthouse as "on vacation," and stated that he would not consider him to be an employee in good standing.
The Defendants called as a witness Serge Jorgensen. The parties stipulated that he is an expert in digital data forensic examination. Mr. Jorgensen testified that his expert services had been requested twice during the course of this case. The first time was in October of 2013, when his company, Sylint, was asked to assist the Defendants with identifying and producing to the Plaintiff documents from a culled-down set provided by the Plaintiff's expert. More recently, Sylint was asked to employ its expertise to explain the possible cause of some evidentiary issues concerning the forensic capture of Mr. McFadden's iPhone.
Mr. Jorgensen testified that the culled-down data set produced to the Plaintiff by its expert, Site Logic, in August 2013, and from which the Defendants identified responsive documents for production, did not include data from McFadden's iPhone5. Mr. Jorgensen explained that he recently discovered that Computer Forensics, the expert that had acquired the data in March 2013, erroneously had introduced an image taken from an unrelated iPhone4 into the data being examined. This unrelated iPhone4 image was included among the data reviewed by SiteLogic in order to produce the culled-down data set in accordance with the protocol10 the parties agreed upon.11 
Mr. Jorgensen described two discrete problems with the culled-down data set provided by Site Logic to the Plaintiff. First, because data had been collected from the wrong iPhone, a search of that data would not have extracted the text messages that are at issue in this proceeding. Second, even if data from the correct iPhone had been included, the text messages could not have been viewed because of the format of the production. Therefore, Mr. Jorgensen questioned whether McFadden would have been able to review the text messages even if the correct iPhone image had been produced.
Mr. Jorgensen also was asked to explain why some of the metadata from files forensically imaged in March 2013 would have date stamps indicating the documents had been created in August 2013. He related that when the Plaintiff's expert accessed the data, it had changed the time stamps on approximately 5,000 files to reflect date stamps of July and August 2013, when the data in question actually had been generated between 2010 and 2013. He noted that the original evidence would still be secure in its evidentiary container, collected by Computer Forensics, and the unaltered evidence would still be accessible to McFadden directly from his laptop. The error had occurred when the data set was collected by Site Logic in 2013, and would affect the ability to accurately filter by date.
Mr. Jorgensen also was asked to explain why certain recently discovered e-mails might not have been produced to Lighthouse by Mr. McFadden at an earlier time.12 He first [*9] noted that the e-mails in question were not part of the culled-down set provided by the Plaintiff's expert. As a result, Mr. Jorgensen examined the original March, 2013 forensic image of Mr. McFadden's laptop hard drive and discovered that all five e-mails were present. Mr. Jorgensen then applied the protocol to the five e-mails and discovered that two of the five should have resulted in "hits" and been included in the culled-down set. He could not explain why they had not. Mr. Jorgensen stated that he found no evidence to indicate that there had been any attempt to delete the e-mails.
III. RECOMMENDATIONS OF LAW 
The Court first notes that to the extent that Plaintiff is urging discovery sanctions for Cross Hatch's incomplete response to Interrogatory 7, the motion is untimely. S.D. Fla. L.R. 26.1(h)(1) requires that discovery motions be filed within thirty days of the occurrence of grounds for the motion absent a showing of good cause for failure to do so. Local Rule 26.1(h)(1) "reflects a policy of promoting the prompt resolution of discovery disputes by requiring the parties to timely bring to the court's attention matters that the parties cannot resolve amongst themselves." Manno v. Healthcare Revenue Recovery Group, LLC, [2012 BL 428824], 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56272 , 2012 WL 1409532 (S.D. Fla. April 23, 2012) (citing, Kendall Lakes Towers Condo. Ass'n, Inc. v. Pac. Ins. Co., [2011 BL 421756], 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 138953 , 2011 WL 6190160 (S.D. Fla. 2011)).
In this case, the Plaintiff first became aware of the text messages exchanged between McFadden and Fuller at least as early as McFadden's March12, 2014 deposition. The instant motion was not filed until May 6, 2014. Discovery closed on March 19, 2014, and trial is imminent. Because the Plaintiff has not shown good cause why this issue was not raised sooner, it will not be considered.
Plaintiff's primary argument however, is that sanctions are appropriate in light of McFadden's unauthorized access to Plaintiff's privileged e-mails. The Court possesses the inherent authority to sanction parties who conduct litigation in bad faith or who perpetrate a fraud on the court. Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32 , 51 , 111 S. Ct. 2123 , 115 L. Ed. 2d 27 (1991). The power to do so arises from the court's need "to manage [its] own affairs so as to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of cases."  Id. at 43 . It is a power, however, that must be exercised with restraint. Roadway Express, Inc. v. Piper, 447 U.S. 752 , 764 , 100 S. Ct. 2455 , 65 L. Ed. 2d 488 (1980). "The key to unlocking the court's inherent power is a finding of bad faith." Barnes v. Dalton, 158 F.3d 1212 , 1214 (11th Cir. 1998). Such a finding may be made when a party's conduct delays or disrupts the litigation, or hampers the enforcement of a court order. Byrne v. Nezhat, 261 F.3d 1075 , 1121 (11th Cir. 2001). Fraud on the court is established "when clear and convincing evidence demonstrates that 'a party has sentiently set in motion some unconscionable scheme calculated to interfere with the judicial system's ability impartially to adjudicate a matter by improperly influencing the trier or unfairly hampering the presentation of the opposing party's claim or defense.'" McDowell v. Seaboard Farms of Athens, Inc., 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19558 , 1996 WL 684140 , *2 (M.D. Fla. 1996)citing Vargas . Peltz, 901 F.Supp. 1572 , 1579 (S.D. Fla. 1995).
The Plaintiff cites two cases in support of its assertion that sanctions are appropriate in this case. [*10] In Eagle Hospital Physicians, LLC v. SRG Consulting, Inc., 561 F.3d 1298 (11th Cir. 2009) the Eleventh Circuit upheld a district court's decision to strike the defendant's answer and affirmative defenses, pursuant to its inherent power, after discovering that the defendant had been secretly monitoring the plaintiff's confidential e-mail communications.13 The district court found that the defendant's refusal in deposition to answer questions about whether he could continue monitoring was sufficient to establish the defendant's bad faith, and that his conduct had disrupted the litigation. The court considered lesser sanctions, but noted that the defendant was privy to privileged information that he could not unlearn, and that neither the plaintiff nor the court could know the extent of the defendant's activities. The severe sanction employed was necessary "as a deterrent to other litigants contemplating improper interception of communications between clients and their attorneys."
In Leor Exploration & Production, LLC v. William Natbony, [2010 BL 400451], 2010 U.S. Dist. Lexis 101824 (S.D. Fla., Sep. 28, 2010) the district court adopted the magistrate judge's recommendation that the defendant's pleadings be stricken for disruption of the litigation by obtaining unauthorized access to privileged communications and by threatening witnesses.14 At the evidentiary hearing on the plaintiffs' sanctions motion, the defendant invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege and declined to answer any questions about the hacking or about his access to the privileged e-mails, and refused to turn over his computer for inspection. Based on the testimony of experts who offered their opinions about how the hacking could have been accomplished and who likely had done it, the magistrate judge concluded that the defendant was responsible and that he had acted in bad faith.
The Defendants here assert that both cases are distinguishable. McFadden has not refused to turn over his devices, nor has he refused to testify. Not only has he appeared for deposition on three occasions, he voluntarily testified at the evidentiary hearing on the instant motion. According to the Defendants, McFadden did not solicit the information from Fuller, and there is no evidence that McFadden utilized any of the privileged communications to the Defendants' advantage. McFadden also asserts that Lighthouse has not offered any evidence of prejudice.
The Court cannot agree. The evidence presented clearly established that Jason Fuller shared with McFadden the content of numerous e-mails revealing litigation strategy, which were intended to be privileged communications between Lighthouse and its attorneys. These communications provided McFadden with advance notice of Lighthouse's litigation tactics, including the contents of Lighthouse's ex parte motion for temporary restraining order, seeking an order requiring McFadden to turn over his devices and enjoining him from destroying any information potentially relevant to Lighthouse's claims.
McFadden may not have realized the gravity [*11] of the actions at the time he committed them. Nevertheless, his admission that he deleted all text messages between himself and Fuller sometime after the March 2013 forensic capture, coupled with his failure to disclose the communications in discovery, suggests that if (as is likely) the communications continued thereafter, he did not want them to be discovered. It is worth noting that McFadden's deletion of the text messages, regardless of whether communication ceased between himself and Fuller after March 19, 2013, was likely in violation of the injunction entered by the Court on April 2, 2013. Additionally, although McFadden claims not to have used the information Fuller disclosed to him, there is no evidence that he discouraged Fuller from continuing to provide him with the "inside" information.
Although Mr. McFadden has been more forthcoming than the defendants in Eagle Hospital and in Leor, there is no way to know when the inappropriate communications between McFadden and Fuller ended. When asked about this, Mr. Fuller invoked his rights under the Fifth Amendment . Moreover, the Plaintiff will never know whether Mr. McFadden shared with his former or current lawyers information provided by Fuller because, when asked, McFadden invoked attorney client privilege15, and Fuller again invoked the Fifth Amendment .
Fact finders in civil proceedings may draw adverse inferences against a party who refuses to testify. Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425 U.S. 308 , 318 , 96 S. Ct. 1551 , 47 L. Ed. 2d 810 (1976). A negative inference also may be drawn against a party when a non-party refuses to testify if such an inference is trustworthy under all of the circumstances and will advance the search for truth. Libutti v. United States, 107 F.3d 110 , 124 (2nd Cir. 1997). The Court should weigh four factors: 1) the nature of the relevant relationship, 2) the degree of control of the party over the non-party witness, 3) the compatibility of the interests of the party and non-party in the outcome of the litigation, and 4) the role of the non-party in the litigation.  Id. at 123-124 . The first and fourth factors weigh heavily in favor of drawing a negative inference from Mr. Fuller's refusal to testify. According to McFadden, the two are friends. Additionally, Mr. Fuller's actions evidence loyalty to McFadden. There is also no question that Mr. Fuller has injected himself into this litigation, and at least with respect to the issues presently before the Court, he has played a key role.
Based upon Mr. Fuller's invocation of his Fifth Amendment privilege when asked when communication with McFadden ceased, the Court infers that communications continued after the March 19, 2013 forensic capture. Although Mr. Fuller no longer has password access to Mr. Taverso's e-mail account, the Defendants unquestionably have had an unfair advantage for an indeterminate amount of time during the course of this litigation. Further, Mr. McFadden admits that he deleted text messages to and from Fuller from his iPhone sometime after being ordered not to destroy any evidence which might potentially be relevant to this case. The Court cannot countenance [*12] such behavior. Short of striking the Defendants' pleadings, the Court cannot fashion a remedy which would cure the prejudice. Neither ordering Defendants to obtain new counsel nor imposing a monetary sanction would be effective, since the entire litigation has been tainted by the unfettered intrusion into Lighthouse's privileged communications. The Court has no choice but to strike the Defendants' pleadings.
IV. CONCLUSION 
This Court having considered carefully the pleadings, arguments of counsel, and the applicable case law, it is hereby
RECOMMENDED that the Plaintiff's Motion for Extraordinary Relief (ECF No. 260) be GRANTED and that all of the Defendants' pleadings be stricken.
The parties will have 14 days from the date of being served with a copy of this Report and Recommendation within which to file written objections, if any, for consideration by The Honorable William P. Dimitrouleas, United States District Judge. Failure to file objections timely shall bar the parties from attacking on appeal factual findings contained herein. LoConte v. Dugger, 847 F.2d 745 (11th Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 958 , 109 S. Ct. 397 , 102 L. Ed. 2d 386 (1988); RTC v. Hallmark Builders, Inc., 996 F.2d 1144 , 1149 (11th Cir. 1993).

JOEL B. TOOMEY 
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION1 
THIS CAUSE is before the Court on Defendants' Motions to Dismiss ("Motions") (Docs. 275, 276, 277, 278, 279) Plaintiffs' Third Amended Class Action Complaint ("TAC") (Doc. 272) and Plaintiffs' Responses thereto (Docs. 280, 281, 282, 283). On June 11, 2014, the Motions were referred to the undersigned [*2] for a report and recommendation regarding an appropriate resolution thereof. (Doc. 286.)
I. Summary of Recommendation 
For the reasons set forth herein, the undersigned recommends that the Motions be GRANTED and the TAC be DISMISSED with prejudice because the TAC suffers from the same deficiencies as the First and Second Amended Complaints ("FAC" and "SAC," respectively). (See Docs. 139, 259, 268.) Further amendment would be futile.
First, as with the prior complaints, the TAC is an unwieldy, prolix, "shotgun pleading." The Court noted these problems in dismissing both the FAC and the SAC. (See id.) However, Plaintiffs have still failed to cure them. Therefore, the undersigned recommends that dismissal with prejudice is appropriate for Plaintiffs' repeated failure to cure these deficiencies.
Next, the undersigned recommends that Count I of the TAC, alleging violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ("RICO"), 18 U.S.C. § 1961 , et seq., be dismissed with prejudice because it is still premised on a fraud-on-the-market theory of reliance/causation/injury, which is not cognizable under RICO or applicable to the real estate market. See, e.g., Se. Laborers Health & Welfare Fund v. Bayer Corp., 444 F. App'x 401 , 405 (11th Cir. 2011) ("We have rejected the fraud on the market theory as being inappropriate in any context other than federal securities fraud litigation.") Plaintiffs have not otherwise pled causation sufficiently to survive a motion to dismiss.
Additionally, Plaintiffs rely solely on an inflated purchase price theory of damages, which the Supreme Court has squarely rejected in the securities fraud context as inconsistent with "traditional elements of causation and loss." See Dura Pharms., Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336 , 342 , 125 S. Ct. 1627 , 161 L. Ed. 2d 577 & 346 (2005) ("[A]n inflated purchase price will not itself constitute or proximately cause the relevant economic loss."). For example, there are no damages alleged aside from the difference between the allegedly inflated prices paid for the properties by Plaintiffs and the supposed actual market value of the properties at the time of purchase. The undersigned recommends that the principles of Dura apply here.
Similarly, the remaining counts should be dismissed with prejudice because each of them also contains a claim that requires causation and damages elements, which cannot be satisfied by a fraud-on-the-market or inflated purchase price theory. For these and other reasons, these counts should be dismissed as well.
Finally, the undersigned recommends that dismissal with, rather than without, prejudice is appropriate. Plaintiffs have had four opportunities to state a claim, two of which have come after the Court specifically informed them of deficiencies in the FAC and SAC. (See Docs. 139, 259, 268.) Rather than curing these deficiencies in the TAC, Plaintiffs have merely reasserted their inapplicable fraud-on-the-market theory in their longest and most unwieldy complaint yet. Because the TAC fails for the same reasons as the FAC and the SAC, the undersigned recommends that dismissal with prejudice is appropriate based on Plaintiffs' repeated [*3] failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, as well as futility of amendment.2 
II. Summary of Allegations in the TAC 
Preliminarily, the undersigned notes that, like the FAC, "[t]he sheer length and confusing structure of the [TAC] makes it difficult to parse." (Doc. 139 at 8.) This is a serious defect that has never been cured. Therefore, the undersigned will address the TAC largely from a global perspective. Plaintiffs allege that from approximately 2002 to 2006, the thirteen named Plaintiffs purchased properties in at least five residential communities 3 located in at least two different states (Florida and North Carolina), which were "developed by the Ginn and Lubert-Adler Defendants at prices that were fraudulently inflated." (Doc. 272 at 1, 13, 18-40.)4 The scheme allegedly "involved every step of the real estate purchase process," and included:
(1) developing extravagant plans and promises for a series of Ginn/Lubert-Adler communities to be presented to potential purchasers in glossy literature, DVDs, at lavish sales launches and through sales programs carefully coordinated by Ginn and Lubert-Adler across the developments; (2) developing the Ginn/Lubert-Adler communities to the extent necessary to give credence to representations that Defendants had the funding and commitment existed to complete the planned amenities, which had value that accompanies same; (3) aggressively pursuing purchasers with lies and misrepresentations and deceptive sales tactics; (4) setting the prices for each property at fixed non-negotiable prices purported to be the fair market value for the lots which were represented to be insufficient to meet demand; (5) selling the properties at far in excess of their fair market value and at fraudulently inflated values which were supported and substantiated by falsely recorded sales information and then reflected on pricing charts used by Ginn and Ginn salespersons in marketing properties to purchasers at the fixed, non-negotiable prices including [sic] in the price lists in standardized priority reservation selection event booklets at each priority reservation event ("sales launches"); (6) obtaining and relying on fraudulent appraisals with the intent to deceive; and (7) enlisting the participation of complicit lenders willing to knowingly provide and finance property sales for fraudulently inflated amounts which substantially exceeded the fair market value of each of the properties they financed.
( Id. at 1, 12-13.)5 

The named Plaintiffs purport to bring this action "on their own behalf and . . . on behalf of a Class of all persons or entities that purchased real estate in Ginn developments, including but not limited to [the Named Developments]," apparently from 1998 through "the present date" (the alleged time frame for the fraudulent scheme), "or such time as will be established after a thorough review of Defendants' records." ( Id. at 1, 105.)
Essentially, Plaintiffs describe Defendants' involvement in the alleged scheme as follows: Lubert-Adler, Fifth Third, SunTrust, and Wachovia [*4] provided the funding; RMA (an "unnamed co-conspirator") developed the marketing, using e-mails, websites, faxes, and targeted mailings; RMA, Ginn,6 and Lubert-Adler conducted sham lotteries, "whisper campaigns," and lavish launches, at which they made misrepresentations about limited availability and high demand for the properties, as well as the amenities that would be built; the bank Defendants 7 invited the prospective purchasers to the launch events, identified the purchasers who had been pre-approved for financing, and used appraisals that they knew or should have known were false; and Ginn Title falsely recorded sales information, such as sales prices and sales dates, which was subsequently used as a basis for the allegedly fraudulent appraisals, which also improperly incorporated the value of leasebacks and furniture packages and used dissimilar properties for comparables without value adjustment. ( Id. at 4-13, 40-105.) Plaintiffs also allege that Defendants' employees and executives, including Dean Adler (CEO of Lubert-Adler) and Bobby Ginn, purchased Ginn properties at discounted rates and "flipped them for substantial profits to unsuspecting buyers at inflated prices." ( Id. at 58-60.)
The TAC contains seven counts and alleges: violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) of RICO as to all Defendants (Ginn/Lubert-Adler Enterprise) and, alternatively, as to Ginn, Lubert-Adler, Ginn Title and ESI (Alternative Enterprise), alleging that Defendants constitute an enterprise which conducted its affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity predicated upon acts of mail and wire fraud (Count I); violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) of RICO as to all Defendants, alleging that each Defendant conspired to violate section 1962(c) (Count II); civil conspiracy as to all Defendants (Count III); breach of fiduciary duty as to Fifth Third, Suntrust, and Wachovia (Count IV); and negligent supervision as to Fifth Third (Count V), SunTrust (Count VI), and Wachovia (Count VII). Each Defendant has moved to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a) , 9(b) , and/or 12(b)(6) .
III. Applicable Standards 
A. General Motion to Dismiss Standard 
Under Rule 12(b)(6) , the Court must determine whether the TAC sets forth sufficient factual allegations to establish a claim upon which relief can be granted. In evaluating whether Plaintiffs have stated a claim, the Court must determine whether the TAC satisfies Rule 8(a)(2) . In addition, where, as here, the complaint contains fraud-based claims, the TAC must also satisfy the heightened pleading requirements of Rule 9(b) .
Rule 8(a)(2) requires that a pleading contain a "short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief." Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2) . To satisfy this standard, a complaint must contain sufficient factual allegations to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 , 679 , 129 S. Ct. 1937 , 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 , 556 , 127 S. Ct. 1955 , 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). "A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged." Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 . Though detailed factual allegations are not required to satisfy [*5] this standard, Rule 8(a) demands "more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation." Id . Indeed, allegations showing "[t]he mere possibility the defendant acted unlawfully [are] insufficient to survive a motion to dismiss." Sinaltrainal v. Coca-Cola Co., 578 F.3d 1252 , 1261 (11th Cir. 2009); see also Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 ("Where a complaint pleads facts that are 'merely consistent with' a defendant's liability, it 'stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.'") (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557 ). Rather, the well-pled allegations must nudge the claim "across the line from conceivable to plausible." Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570 .
In ruling on a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) , a court must construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and accept all well-pled factual allegations as true. Sinaltrainal, 578 F.3d at 1260 . Although the Court must accept well-pled facts as true, it is not required to accept Plaintiffs' legal conclusions. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (noting "the tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions"). In evaluating the sufficiency of a plaintiff's pleadings, a court is "not required to draw plaintiff's inference." Sinaltrainal, 578 F.3d at 1260 (internal citation and quotations omitted). "Similarly, unwarranted deductions of fact in a complaint are not admitted as true for the purpose of testing the sufficiency of plaintiff's allegations." Id . (internal citation and quotations omitted); see also Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 681 (stating conclusory allegations are "not entitled to be assumed true").
B. Fraud Pleading Standard 
In addition to satisfying the Rule 8 requirements articulated by Twombly and Iqbal, a plaintiff alleging fraud must "state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud." Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) .8 This particularity requirement is required so as to "alert[ ] defendants to the precise misconduct with which they are charged and [to] protect[ ] defendants against spurious charges of immoral and fraudulent behavior." Wagner v. First Horizon Pharm. Corp., 464 F.3d 1273 , 1277 (11th Cir. 2006) (alterations in original, internal citation omitted). Thus, to satisfy Rule 9(b) , a complaint alleging fraud-based claims must set forth the following with respect to each allegation of fraud:
(1) precisely what statements were made in what documents or oral representations or what omissions were made; (2) the time and place of each such statement and person responsible for making (or in, the case of omissions, not making) same; (3) the content of such statements and the manner in which they misled the plaintiffs; and (4) what the defendants obtained as a consequence of the fraud.
Rogers v. Nacchio, 241 F. App'x 602 , 608 (11th Cir. 2007) (quoting Ziemba v. Cascade Intern., Inc., 256 F.3d 1194 , 1202 (11th Cir. 2001)).

When a complaint alleges fraud-based claims against multiple defendants, Rule 9(b) requires specific allegations with respect to each defendant. Ambrosia Coal, 482 F.3d at 1317 ; Brooks v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Fla., Inc., 116 F.3d 1364 , 1380-81 (11th Cir. 1997). These specific allegations "should inform each defendant of the nature of his alleged participation in the fraud." Ambrosia Coal, 482 F.3d at 1317 (affirming dismissal of a RICO complaint on Rule 9(b) grounds where [*6] complaint failed to allege "the nature of each defendant's participation in the scheme," failed to identify "each alleged statement, document, or misrepresentation made with the proper level of precision," and failed to specify "the content or manner in which the statements misled [the plaintiff]").
C. RICO Pleading Standard 
To properly plead a RICO claim under section 1962(c) , a plaintiff must plead facts supporting the following elements: "(1) conduct; (2) of [a RICO] enterprise; (3) through a pattern; (4) of racketeering activity." Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479 , 496 , 105 S. Ct. 3275 , 87 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1985). To support the pattern element, a plaintiff must plead facts to support the following sub-elements: (1) the commission of two or more predicate acts of racketeering activity within a ten-year time span; (2) the predicate acts were related to one another; and (3) the predicate acts demonstrated criminal conduct of a continuing nature. Jackson v. BellSouth Telecomms., 372 F.3d 1250 , 1264 (11th Cir. 2004); 18 U.S.C. § 1961(5) . "Racketeering activity" means the violation of any of the criminal statutes set forth in section 1961(1)(B) , which include the statutes criminalizing mail fraud ( 18 U.S.C. § 1341 ) and wire fraud ( 18 U.S.C. § 1343 ).9 The circumstances constituting fraud must be pled with particularity under Rule 9(b) as against each Defendant. See Ambrosia Coal, 482 F.3d at 1317 .
In addition, in civil cases, "RICO plaintiffs must satisfy the requirements of 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) ," i.e., they "must show (1) the requisite injury to 'business or property,' and (2) that such injury was 'by reason of' the substantive RICO violation." Williams v. Mohawk Indus., Inc., 465 F.3d 1277 , 1282-83 (11th Cir. 2006) (per curiam).10"[C]ourts should scrutinize proximate causation at the pleading stage and carefully evaluate whether the injury pled was proximately caused by the claimed RICO violations."  Id. at 1287 (citing Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp., 547 U.S. 451 , 461 , 126 S. Ct. 1991 , 164 L. Ed. 2d 720 (2006)). Although plaintiffs are not required "to show that the injurious conduct is the sole cause of the injury asserted, . . . there must be 'some direct relation' between the injury alleged and the injurious conduct in order to show proximate cause."  Id. at 1287-88 (citing Anza, 547 U.S. at 457 ). "[I]t is enough for the plaintiff to plead and prove that the defendant's tortious or injurious conduct was a 'substantial factor in the sequence of responsible causation.'"  Id. at 1288 n.5.
"[D]irectness of relationship . . . [is required] for a variety of reasons." Holmes v. Sec. Investor Prot. Corp., 503 U.S. 258 , 269 , 112 S. Ct. 1311 , 117 L. Ed. 2d 532 (1992). "First, the less direct an injury is, the more difficult it becomes to ascertain the amount of a plaintiff's damages attributable to the violation, as distinct from other, independent, factors." Id . "Second, . . . recognizing claims of the indirectly injured would force courts to adopt complicated rules apportioning damages among plaintiffs removed at different levels of injury from the violative acts, to obviate the risk of multiple recoveries." Id . "[F]inally, the need to grapple with these problems is simply unjustified by the general interest in deterring injurious conduct, since directly injured victims can generally be counted on to vindicate the law as private attorneys general, without any of the problems attendant upon suits by plaintiffs injured more remotely."  Id. at 269-70 [*7] .
IV. Analysis 
A. The TAC is an Unwieldy, Prolix, "Shotgun Pleading" 11 
The 142-page TAC, which begins with a single paragraph spanning two pages, does not reach the first of its seven counts until page 108. Plaintiffs spend 22 of the first 107 pages making lengthy, conclusory, and confusing allegations as to reliance/causation/damages for each of the named Plaintiffs. ( Id. at 18-40.) Plaintiffs then spend the next 65 pages detailing the roles of each Defendant in the fraudulent scheme, including numerous scattershot examples of the alleged fraudulent conduct. ( Id. at 40-105.)12 Therefore, much like the FAC, the TAC again attempts to support conclusory allegations as to each Plaintiff and class member (see, e.g.,  id. at 18-40, 105-140) with "factual enhancement" and "framework" as to each Defendant (see, e.g.,  id. at 40-105) to "demonstrat[e] the plausibility of the claims alleged." (See Doc. 139 at 12-13.) As this Court previously noted in regard to the FAC: "The sheer length and confusing structure of the FAC makes it difficult to parse." ( Id. at 8.) That observation remains applicable to the TAC.
However, as discussed in more detail below, the TAC again fails to meaningfully connect any specific fraudulent conduct to any specific damages suffered by any specific Plaintiff. Instead, it merely incorporates by reference at least 104 pages, or 255 paragraphs, of factual allegations into each of its seven counts. (See  id. at 108, 126, 128, 131, 133, 135, 138.) The FAC was dismissed largely for these same reasons. (See Doc. 139 at 8-13.) As the Court explained previously, although not a "quintessential shotgun pleading," the structure of the TAC renders it a shotgun pleading because "the counts themselves contain no facts; rather, the 'irrelevant factual allegations' through which this Court must sift are located within the [255]-plus paragraphs [or 104-plus pages] incorporated into each count." (Doc. 139 at 10 n.15.)13 
Moreover, although dismissal of the SAC did not focus on these problems, primarily because the 68-page SAC was an improvement over the 135-page FAC, the Court noted that similar problems still existed in the SAC. (See Doc. 259 at 4 n.7.) Finally, the Court's suggestion that Plaintiffs plead more specific facts in dismissing the FAC and the SAC does not excuse the filing of another unwieldy, verbose pleading. In fact, the Court specifically addressed this issue in its Order dismissing the FAC, stating "plaintiffs are reminded that Rule 9(b) 's particularity requirement does not mandate unwieldy, prolix complaints." (Doc. 139 at 12 n.18.) Thus, Plaintiffs have now repeatedly failed to cure the aforementioned deficiencies by previous amendments allowed. Therefore, the undersigned recommends that, for this reason alone, dismissal of the TAC with prejudice is appropriate.
B. Plaintiffs' RICO Claim (Count I) Fails 
1. Plaintiffs Fail to Sufficiently Allege Causation 
In dismissing the FAC, the Court noted its "concerns about the Plaintiffs' ability to satisfy RICO's proximate cause requirement," explaining that they "must do a better job of concisely identifying who did wrong, what specific actions they [*8] took that were wrong and how the Plaintiffs were proximately and adversely affected by these actions." (Doc. 139 at 17-19.) Subsequently, the Court noted that "the SAC continues to suffer from many of the same deficiencies identified in the Court's September 21, 2010 Order . . . [including] a basic fatal defect because it is premised on a fraud-on-the-market theory of reliance/causation/injury." (Doc. 259 at 10.) The Court explained that "[b]ecause such a theory is not applicable to real estate markets, and is recognized only in federal securities cases, the undersigned recommends that the SAC be dismissed without prejudice." ( Id.) Despite the Court's explicit pleading instructions with regard to the FAC, and its clear rejection of Plaintiffs' legal theory advanced in the SAC, the TAC merely presents a more detailed version of the same fraud-on-the-market theory to support causation.
i. Fraud-on-the-Market Theory Defined 
The fraud-on-the-market theory is "a presumption of reliance in the securities fraud context where the defendant disseminates a fraud to an efficient capital market." Se. Laborers Health, 444 F. App'x at 405 . "In that context, plaintiffs who purchased securities are permitted to demonstrate that they were damaged simply because defendant engaged in behavior otherwise prohibited and there was a change in price." Id . 
The fraud on the market theory is based on the hypothesis that, in an open and developed securities market, the price of a company's stock is determined by the available material information regarding the company and its business. . . . Misleading statements will therefore defraud purchasers of stock even if the purchasers do not directly rely on the misstatements. . . . The causal connection between the defendants' fraud and the plaintiffs' purchase of stock in such a case is no less significant than in a case of direct reliance on misrepresentations. . . . In this manner, evidence of a fraud disseminated to an open market creates a rebuttable presumption of reliance in the securities fraud context.
Id . (citing Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224 , 241-42 , 108 S. Ct. 978 , 99 L. Ed. 2d 194 (1988)). However, the presumption of reliance is not applicable in any other market, including the real estate market. See, e.g., Appletree Square I, Ltd. v. W.R. Grace & Co., 29 F.3d 1283 , 1287 (8th Cir. 1994) ("The real estate market, unlike the stock market, is not a well-developed market in which the price of a building reflects all publicly available information.")

ii. Summary of the Court's Conclusions Regarding the SAC's Fraud-on-the-Market Theory 
In dismissing the SAC, the Court found that Plaintiffs necessarily relied on a fraud-on-the-market theory of reliance/causation/damages for primarily four reasons. First, the Court noted that the crux of Plaintiffs' case was that they all paid above-market prices for Ginn real estate because Defendants fraudulently inflated the value of all Ginn properties, i.e., "the entire market." (See Doc. 259 at 13-14.) Next, the Court found that the extreme breadth of the SAC, including its class-action allegations, evidenced Plaintiffs' fraud-on-the-market theory, stating "[i]t is difficult to fathom how Plaintiffs could purport [*9] to bring this action on behalf of all purchasers of Ginn properties over an unspecified time period if they are not relying on a fraud-on-the-market theory." ( Id. at 14-15.) Additionally, the Court noted the lack of specific allegations regarding Plaintiffs' reliance and causation of damages in concluding that the Plaintiffs must be relying on a fraud-on-the-market theory, which presumes such reliance. ( Id. at 15-16.) Finally, the Court noted that the damages sought were only available in fraud-on-the-market cases. ( Id. at 16.)
As with the SAC, Plaintiffs continue to argue that they are not relying on a fraud-on-the-market theory to demonstrate causation or injury in the TAC (see, e.g., Doc. 282 at 18). See In re Schering-Plough Corp., Case No. 2:06-cv-5774, [2009 BL 148399], 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58900 , 2009 WL 2043604 , at *20 (D. N.J. July 10, 2009) ("Plaintiffs do not expressly plead a fraud on the market theory of RICO injury, presumably because such a theory has been resoundingly rejected outside the context of federal securities fraud litigation.").14 However, as discussed below, the allegations in the TAC, although more detailed, are essentially the same as those in the SAC. Therefore, the TAC fails for the same reasons as the SAC as to reliance and causation.
iii. The TAC Still Relies on a Market-Wide Price Inflation Theory 
The TAC relies on the exact same premise as the SAC regarding inflation of the entire market for Ginn properties. Otherwise, there is no possible way the TAC could be brought as a purported "Class Action Complaint." (Doc. 272 at 1.) For example, the TAC alleges that all Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and the purported class, "have suffered losses . . . because they were induced to pay far in excess of the fair market value [of] properties at the time they purchased them as a consequence [of the] fraudulent overpricing that resulted from the conduct" of Defendants. (Doc. 272 at 125-26.) The TAC further alleges that absent Defendants' conduct, as a result of which "the apparent value of Ginn/Lubert-Albert properties was inflated . . . , Plaintiffs and Class members would have been advised of and known the fair market value of the properties at the time they purchased them and would not have paid, or agreed to pay, the above-fair market value prices that they were induced to pay or agree to pay as a result of the scheme." ( Id. at 124-25) (emphasis added). Thus, despite Plaintiffs' attempt to address individual purchases in the TAC, the only plausible reading of the TAC as a whole indicates that Plaintiffs' market-wide inflation theory remains the same.
iv. The Scope of the TAC has not Been Narrowed 
Plaintiffs argue that they have significantly narrowed the scope of the TAC to address the Court's concerns regarding the breadth of the SAC.15(See Doc. 282 at 20.) The undersigned disagrees. The TAC names thirteen instead of sixteen Plaintiffs, and seven instead of nine Defendants. (Compare Doc. 141 at 1 with Doc. 272 at 1.) Additionally, the TAC focuses on only five developments in two states rather than eleven developments in four states. (Compare Doc. 141 at 13 with Doc. 272 at 13.) Although in some respects the TAC may be slightly narrower than the SAC, it is still [*10] extremely broad.
Moreover, Plaintiffs maintain class action allegations in the TAC that are at least as broad as those presented in the SAC. Specifically, the TAC defines the class as "all persons or entities that purchased real estate in Ginn developments, including but not limited to: [the Named Developments]." (Doc. 272 at 105) (emphasis added). Furthermore, there appears to be no time limitation defined for the class in the TAC, other than an allegation that the allegedly fraudulent scheme began in 1998. (See  id. at 1, 105-108.) The TAC alleges that the class contains "thousands of members." ( Id. at 105.) Therefore, it appears that the elimination of three named plaintiffs, two defendants, and six specific developments has no meaningful effect on the scope of the TAC, particularly in light of the class action allegations.16 
Additionally, with regard to many of the named Plaintiffs, the TAC specifically provides that these Plaintiffs:
also purchased properties in Ginn developments other than those addressed in the [TAC]. They and the other Plaintiffs expressly reserve the right to move to amend to include additional properties should they determine on the basis of discovery that the narrowing of the TAC to address the Court's concerns led to the inappropriate exclusion of such properties.
(See, e.g.,  id. at 26 n.1) (emphasis added). Thus, it appears that Plaintiffs may seek to broaden their claims in the future. Accordingly, Plaintiffs have not narrowed the scope of the TAC from the SAC in any meaningful way.17 

v. The TAC Still Fails to Plausibly Allege Specific Reliance and Causation Even as to the Named Plaintiffs 
In more than doubling the length of the SAC, Plaintiffs attempt to allege specific reliance as to each named Plaintiff, as well as sufficient factual details in support thereof, to avoid dismissal. As explained above, the TAC spends 22 pages, or 42 paragraphs, making confusing, conclusory allegations regarding each named Plaintiff's reliance on various actions taken by Defendants. (Doc. 272 at 18-40.) The TAC then spends the next 65 pages, or 186 paragraphs, detailing "[t]he Defendants' roles in the fraudulent scheme." ( Id. at 40-105.) Although this section contains detailed factual allegations, the allegations are largely presented in the form of seemingly random examples which are not tied to any specific Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs' alleged reliance thereon, or Plaintiffs' alleged damages. (See id.) Instead of coherently alleging that specific Plaintiffs relied on specific fraudulent conduct by specific Defendants which resulted in specific damages, Plaintiffs essentially allege that misconduct "involved in every step of the real estate purchase process" (see  id. at 1) tainted the entire market for Ginn properties, resulting in artificial inflation of the market value of every piece of property purchased by Plaintiffs.18 
First, most of what Plaintiffs' allege they specifically relied on amounts to nothing more than puffery, salesmanship, and future promises, not fraudulent conduct.19 To the extent that reliance on fraudulent conduct [*11] is alleged as to any specific Plaintiffs, the allegations are conclusory and not tied specifically to additional facts regarding specific Defendants which would render them plausible. For example, named-Plaintiffs Stephen and Elizabeth Frieze allegedly relied, in part, on fraudulent appraisals by a named "complicit appraiser" who provided the "appraisal[s] necessary to execute the scheme." ( Id. at 24-26.) However, nowhere in the "Inflated Appraisals" section of the TAC are these specific appraisals apparently even mentioned, much less detailed in a manner which would render plausible the allegations that they were fraudulent. (See  id. at 96-105.) Nor are they mentioned in non-conclusory terms in any other applicable section of the TAC. (See, e.g., 54-57.)20 Thus, this type of alleged reliance on fraudulent appraisals by a named Plaintiff is entirely conclusory.
As an additional example, the TAC contains a lengthy critique, apparently by Plaintiffs' expert, of appraisals done by appraiser Bradley S. Long. (Doc. 272 at 99-102.) Although an appraisal at issue is tied to a property purchased by Plaintiff John Miller, the allegations regarding Mr. Miller's reliance thereon are indirect, attenuated, and lumped together with a host of other factors. ( Id. at 32-33.) For example, apparently Mr. Miller did not rely on the appraisal itself, but allegedly on what others told him about an appraisal, presumably but not necessarily Mr. Long's appraisal, in addition to relying on statements that the property was a "good value," sales pitches and other factors. ( Id. at 33.) Therefore, these allegations of causation regarding this appraisal are not plausible despite the great detail in the critique of the appraisal.21 Specifically, the allegations relating to Mr. Miller, found nearly 70 pages before the critique of the subject appraisal, are not pled with the particularity required for fraud claims, and his reliance is not sufficiently pled to survive causation scrutiny at the pleading stage in the RICO context. (See id.)
These examples are indicative of the problem with allegations throughout the TAC. The allegations as to the specific Plaintiffs are vague, conclusory and overly broad (see, e.g.,  id. at 18-40), and the overly-detailed factual "examples" found much later in the TAC do not plausibly connect causation with each Plaintiff. Moreover, like both the FAC and the SAC, the TAC largely "follows its general allegations of the 'fraudulent scheme' with specific allegations that a particular defendant engaged in conduct which appears to be, at best, 'merely consistent with' that defendant's liability."22(See Doc. 139 at 11-12; Doc. 268 at 7 n.3.)
Notably, Plaintiffs allege that "[r]egardless of the specific appraisal, recording, or other tactic which was used with regard to a particular [purchaser], each [purchaser] was harmed by Defendants' overarching scheme." (Doc. 272 at 106.) Thus, it appears that Plaintiffs are relying on a theory that, because there was fraud "involved at every step of the real estate purchase process," every purchaser necessarily relied on some fraudulent conduct. [*12] However, this is nothing more than a repackaged fraud-on-the-market theory. See Thompson's Gas & Elec. Serv. v. BP Am. Inc., 691 F. Supp. 2d 860 (N.D. Ill 2010) (holding that reliance on fraudulent conduct of a company cannot be presumed in an inefficient market (such as a real estate market) even when all information available regarding that market is false as a result of the company's fraudulent conduct).
vi. The TAC Alleges no Plausible Damages Other Than Fraud-on-the-Market Damages 
Additionally, based on Plaintiffs' characterization of their damages as a "fraud premium" constituting the amount each overpaid as a result of Defendants' alleged conduct that fraudulently inflated the purchase price of all Ginn properties, (see, e.g., Doc. 282 at 22), the conclusion that Plaintiffs are relying on a fraud-on-the-market theory remains inescapable. For example, the TAC does not allege what actually happened to the properties purchased by most Plaintiffs, or how much, if any, money most Plaintiffs actually lost. See In re Schering-Plough Corp., [2009 BL 148399], 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58900 , 2009 WL 2043604 , at *21 ("While denominated as a premium price or price inflation theory of injury, it is abundantly clear that Plaintiffs' fourth theory of injury is actually a classic fraud-on-the-market theory normally pled in securities fraud cases, but one which is not cognizable under RICO.").
The TAC alleges a RICO claim no different than any other fraud-on-the-market claim. It alleges that Defendants' conduct led plaintiffs to pay a higher price than they would otherwise pay absent the allegedly fraudulent conduct. (Doc. 272 at 124-126.) See FindWhat Investor Grp. v. FindWhat.Com, 658 F.3d 1282 , 1311 (11th Cir. 2011) ("In a fraud-on-the-market case[,] . . . the plaintiff's claim is generally . . . that the initial investment transaction . . . would have occurred at a different price [in the absence of the alleged fraud.]"); see also In re Schering-Plough Corp., [2009 BL 148399], 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58900 , 2009 WL 2043604 , at *21 ("To plead injury under a fraud-on-the-market theory, a plaintiff need only allege that the price of a drug 'was higher than it should have been as a result of defendant's fraudulent marketing campaign[.]'").23 
Because "allowing a fraud on the market theory to satisfy the mandatory elements of ascertainable loss and causal nexus [in this case] would virtually eliminate the requirement that there be a connection between the misdeed complained of and the loss suffered," it has been rejected "in any context other than federal securities fraud litigation." See Se. Laborers Health, 444 F. App'x at 405-406 (internal citations and quotations omitted). Therefore, because the TAC relies on a fraud-on-the-market theory, the undersigned recommends that Plaintiffs' RICO claim be dismissed with prejudice. See In re Schering-Plough Corp., [2009 BL 148399], 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58900 , 2009 WL 2043604 at *20, 22 (stating that a fraud-on-the-market "theory has been resoundingly rejected outside the context of federal securities fraud litigation" and it "is not cognizable under RICO").
2. Plaintiffs Rely on an Inapplicable Inflated Purchase Price Theory of Damages 
Separate and apart from Plaintiffs' reliance on a fraud-on-the-market theory of causation is their equally inapplicable reliance on an inflated purchase price theory of [*13] damages. Plaintiffs argue that the amount of each Plaintiff's and class member's damages is the "delta between the value of the properties as determined by an appraisal using proper methodology and comparables and the non-negotiable, fixed price represented to be the fair market value at the time of sale." (Doc. 280 at 21.) Plaintiffs thus argue that this "fraud premium" is "measured at the time of purchase" and constitutes each purchaser's "out-of-pocket" damages. (Doc. 282 at 22-23.) Therefore, Plaintiffs contend that "[t]he decline in the real estate market after Plaintiffs' purchase[s] has no bearing on this case or the damages claimed."24(Doc. 283 at 21.)
i. Application of Dura 
The Supreme Court squarely rejected Plaintiffs' theory of damages in Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo, 544 U.S. 336 , 125 S. Ct. 1627 , 161 L. Ed. 2d 577 (2005). In Dura, the Court considered whether "plaintiffs need only 'establish' . . . that 'the price on the date of purchase was inflated because of the misrepresentation'" in order to allege loss causation in the securities context.  Id. at 342 . The Supreme Court held that "an inflated purchase price will not itself constitute or proximately cause the relevant economic loss." Id . 25 
Plaintiffs argue that it is not Dura, but Gilchrist Timber Co. v. Rayonier, Inc., 472 F.3d 1329 (11th Cir. 2006) which controls for purposes of their "out-of-pocket" damages argument. (See, e.g., Doc. 280 at 22.) However, Gilchrist dealt only with a narrow issue of prejudgment interest under Florida law. See Gilchrist, 472 F.3d at 1331 . In doing so, it explained how the jury computed the relevant damages, but explicitly stated that "the method by which the jury was asked to calculate damages . . . [is] not before us now." ( Id. at 1334 ) (emphasis added). Therefore, the Eleventh Circuit did not approve of Plaintiffs' theory of damages, particularly in a RICO context. The underlying claim in Gilchrist was made pursuant to Florida law and involved a single piece of property. Plaintiffs' RICO claim, involving the purchase of every piece of property in every Ginn development over an unspecified length of time, is clearly distinguishable. Therefore, Gilchrist does not control.
Plaintiffs also attempt to limit the holding in Dura to the securities context, arguing that "unlike a share of stock, real property is a tangible good with a measurable worth as established by standardized appraisal methodology." (Doc. 282 at 20.) Plaintiffs argue that retrospective appraisals of the properties at issue can determine the amount of damages incurred by Plaintiffs at the time the properties were purchased. ( Id.) Therefore, Plaintiffs argue essentially that Dura is inapplicable because its holding is based on the unique nature of securities.
The undersigned rejects this argument and recommends that Dura is applicable to this case and does bar Plaintiffs' theory of damages. First, the Eleventh Circuit has not rejected the application of Dura in a RICO context. The undersigned is aware of the non-binding, unpublished opinion of Lopez v. RICA Foods, Inc., 277 F. App'x 931 (11th Cir. 2008). However, Lopez is distinguishable because it did not involve a RICO claim, but only securities claims (to which it [*14] applied Dura), and fraud claims under Florida law (to which it did not apply Dura). In a RICO context, Dura appears to be consistent with the Eleventh Circuit's directive to scrutinize causation at the pleading stage, see Williams, 465 F.3d at 1282-83 , and with that court's rejection of a theoretical approach to damages in such cases, see Simpson v. Sanderson Farms, Inc., 744 F.3d 702 , 709 (11th Cir. 2014) (affirming dismissal of a class-action RICO complaint where the plaintiffs "pled injury at only the highest order of abstraction and with only conclusory assertions"). Moreover, Dura makes clear that it does not create a special new rule for securities litigation, but merely applies well-established common-law fraud and causation principles in the securities context. Specifically, the Dura Court explained in detail the "common-law roots of the securities fraud action," and that such claims require that plaintiffs "adequately allege and prove the traditional elements of causation and loss." Dura, 544 U.S. at 344-46 (emphasis added).
Moreover, Dura discussed the practical problems with allowing an inflated purchase price theory of damages, opining that "the logical link between the inflated . . . purchase price and any later economic loss is not invariably strong" because many things can affect the value of an investment.  Id. at 342-43 . Additionally, the court noted its concern that allowing this theory of damages would "provide investors with broad insurance against market losses."  Id. at 345 .26 Therefore, although Dura specifically dealt with securities litigation, for all of the aforementioned reasons, the undersigned recommends that its rationale is equally applicable to the instant case.
3. Lester and Acciard Remain Distinguishable 
Plaintiffs rely on Lester v. Percudani, 556 F. Supp. 2d 473 (M.D. Pa. 2008), and Acciard v. Whitney, Case No. 2:07-cv-476-UA-DNF, [2008 BL 270199], 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98131 , 2008 WL 5120898 (M.D. Fla. Dec. 4, 2008), for the proposition that the RICO claim in the TAC should not be dismissed because the RICO claims in those cases survived motions to dismiss under facts similar to those presented in the TAC.27(See, e.g., Doc. 282 at 20-22.) However, not only are Lester and Acciard both non-binding district court opinions, they are each distinguishable. The Court already distinguished Lester in its Order dismissing the SAC, explaining that the SAC lacked the causation and detail present in Lester, and that Lester dealt with far fewer purchasers, properties, and geographic locations. (Doc. 268 at 5-7.)
Plaintiffs argue that Lester is no longer distinguishable because "the TAC now addresses a limited number of developments, with many repeat sales occuring in two of them." (Doc. 282 at 21.) However, as previously discussed, the TAC presents class allegations that relate to purchases of all Ginn properties over an unspecified period of time. Moreover, Plaintiffs have specifically reserved the right to amend their allegations to include additional properties not addressed in the TAC. Therefore, Plaintiffs have not meaningfully narrowed the TAC at all. Furthermore, as discussed throughout this Report and Recommendation, the TAC still fails the causation requirement [*15] despite the additional facts pled by Plaintiffs. Therefore, Lester remains distinguishable.
The undersigned finds Acciard distinguishable as well. Acciard involved a RICO claim brought by real estate students against their "professors." See Acciard, [2008 BL 270199], 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98131 , 2008 WL 5120898 , at *1-4. The students alleged that their "professors" engaged in a scheme wherein they would teach the students about good investment opportunities, present such "opportunities" to them, and then fraudulently induce the students to purchase properties in excess of their fair market value. Id . 
Acciard is distinguishable in at lease one respect because Plaintiffs here have not plausibly alleged that any specific relationships of trust led to their purchases of properties. Plaintiffs attempt to allege, in a conclusory manner without any factual support, that they placed trust in employees of the bank Defendants and therefore relied on their representations in purchasing the properties. (See Doc. 272 at 18-40.) Not only are these allegations conclusory, they are also different from the trust relationships alleged in Acciard. A student trusting his or her own teacher to give advice in the subject area of a course is distinguishable from a real estate investor trusting a banker seeking to maximize profits on mortgage loans. In short, Plaintiffs' addition of a breach of fiduciary duty claim as to the bank Defendants does not bring this case withing the purview of Acciard. Therefore, both cases remain distinguishable, and the undersigned recommends that the RICO claim (Count I) be dismissed with prejudice.28 
C. The Remaining Counts (Counts II-VII) in the TAC Fail 
In light of the above conclusion as to Count I, the remaining counts (Counts II through VII) in the TAC also fail because they are each unwieldy and premised on a fraud-on-the-market theory, as well as an inflated purchase price theory, which are not recognized in this context or for these claims.
In addition, regarding Count II, it is well settled that plaintiffs cannot proceed on a RICO conspiracy claim under section 1962(d) ,29 when they have not adequately alleged a substantive RICO violation. See Rogers, 241 F. App'x at 609 ("Thus, where a plaintiff fails to state a RICO claim and the conspiracy count does not contain additional allegations, the conspiracy claim necessarily fails."); Super Vision Intern., Inc. v. Mega Intern. Commercial Bank Co., 534 F. Supp. 2d 1326 , 1342 (S.D. Fla. 2008) ("Because [the court] concluded that Plaintiff had failed to state a claim for civil RICO under § 1962(c) or § 1962(a) , [Plaintiff's] RICO conspiracy claim necessarily fails.").
Count III, alleging civil conspiracy under Florida law, also contains causation and damages requirements, which cannot be satisfied by a fraud-on-the-market theory or an inflated purchase price theory. See Raimi v. Furlong, 702 So. 2d 1273 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1997) ("A civil conspiracy requires: (a) an agreement between two or more parties, (b) to do an unlawful act or to do a lawful act by unlawful means, (c) the doing of some overt act in pursuance of the conspiracy, and (d) damage to plaintiff as a result of the acts done under the conspiracy." (emphasis added)).
Count [*16] IV, alleging breach of fiduciary duty under Florida law against the bank Defendants, also contains causation and damages elements. See Resnick v. AvMed, Inc., 693 F.3d 1317 , 1325 (11th Cir. 2012) ("The elements of a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty in Florida include damages flowing from the breach." (quotations omitted) (emphasis added)). Again, this element cannot be satisfied using a fraud-on-the-market or inflated purchase price theory.
Finally, Counts V, VI, and VII, alleging negligent supervision against the bank Defendants, should also be dismissed with prejudice because the underlying claim on which they are premised—civil conspiracy—fails as stated herein. Moreover, similar to Counts I-IV, the negligent supervision counts have causation and damage elements, which cannot be satisfied by a fraud-on-the-market or an inflated purchase price theory. See Geidel v. Bradenton Beach, 56 F. Supp. 2d 1359 , 1366 (M.D. Fla. 1999) ("In order for Plaintiffs to sustain [a negligent and inadequate supervision count] which [is] predicated on negligence, they must establish: (1) existence of a duty on the part of the defendant to protect the plaintiff from the injury or damage of which he complains; (2) failure of the defendant to perform that duty; and (3) injury or damage to the plaintiff proximately caused by such failure." (emphasis added) (quotations and citation omitted)). Therefore, the undersigned recommends that all counts in the TAC be dismissed with prejudice.
D. Dismissal of the TAC Should be With Prejudice 
Plaintiffs request leave to amend the TAC in the event the Court dismisses any of the claims. (Doc. 283 at 29.) Rule 15(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that "[t]he court should freely give leave [to amend pleadings] when justice so requires." The Supreme Court has stated that "this mandate is to be heeded." Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178 , 182 , 83 S. Ct. 227 , 9 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1962). The Supreme Court further stated:
In the absence of any apparent or declared reason—such as undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment, futility of amendment, etc.—the leave sought should, as the rules require, be "freely given." Of course, the grant or denial of an opportunity to amend is within the discretion of the District Court, but outright refusal to grant the leave without any justifying reason appearing for the denial is not an exercise of discretion; it is merely abuse of that discretion and inconsistent with the spirit of the Federal Rules.
Id . (emphasis added).

Even under the above strict standard, the undersigned recommends that the TAC be dismissed with prejudice because of Plaintiffs' "repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed," as well as the "futility of amendment." Plaintiffs have filed a total of four complaints, two of which came after they were given explicit guidance by the Court as to the deficiencies in the FAC and the SAC. (See Docs. 139, 259, 268.) The TAC continues to be extremely unwieldy, and continues to rely on a fraud-on-the-market [*17] theory after the Court went to great lengths to point out these deficiencies in the FAC and the SAC. (See id.) Moreover, the TAC contains nearly identical class allegations as the SAC, about which the Court expressed great concern. (Doc. 259 at 14-15.) Additionally, the TAC continues to rely on an inflated purchase price theory even though the Eleventh Circuit has not recognized this theory in a RICO context.30 As a whole, this constitutes a repeated failure to cure deficiencies by previous amendments allowed, which warrants dismissal with prejudice.
Moreover, for the reasons discussed throughout this Report and Recommendation, amendment by Plaintiffs at this point would be futile. Specifically, the problems with the TAC are not curable because Plaintiffs simply cannot plausibly tie specific fraud by each Defendant to causation of specific damages to each Plaintiff. In addition, it appears at this point that Plaintiffs are intent on bringing this action as a class action.31 Plaintiffs cannot even sufficiently allege reliance/causation/damages as to the thirteen named Plaintiffs, much less a class, because Plaintiffs' basic legal theories regarding causation and damages are flawed in this context. Therefore, amendment would be futile.
Finally, in dismissing the SAC, the Court stated unequivocally that "failure to state a viable claim in the third amended complaint will result in dismissal with prejudice." (Doc. 268 at 7.) Therefore, the undersigned recommends dismissal of the TAC with prejudice.
RECOMMENDATION
Accordingly, it is respectfully RECOMMENDED that:
The Motions (Docs. 275, 276, 277, 278, 279) be GRANTED and Plaintiffs' TAC (Doc. 272) be DISMISSED with prejudice.

Although Defendants' Motions raise a number of other arguments in support of dismissal, those arguments need not be addressed in light of the recommendation that the TAC be dismissed with prejudice for Plaintiffs' repeated failure to cure the unwieldiness of their complaint, or to adequately allege proximate cause and damages, which are case dispositive.

Similarly, wire fraud requires a showing of "(1) intentional participation in a scheme to defraud and (2) use of the interstate wires in furtherance of the scheme." U.S. v.

"The 'by reason of' requirement implicates two concepts: (1) a sufficiently direct injury so that a plaintiff has standing to sue; and (2) proximate cause." Williams, 465 F.3d at 1287 . In the context of civil RICO claims these two concepts overlap. Id . at n.4.

fn 
11
Although not necessarily the primary reason for recommending dismissal with prejudice, the undersigned addresses the nature of the TAC first because it demonstrates why a global analysis of the TAC, rather than a specific analysis as to each plaintiff/defendant/claim, is necessary.

fn 
12
Many of these examples are contained in lengthy single-spaced subparagraphs. (See, e.g., Doc. 272 at 54-56.)

fn 
13
Furthering the confusion, none of Plaintiffs' seven counts incorporates the TAC's Introduction or Class Action Allegations. (See Doc. 272 at 108, 126, 128, 131, 133, 135, 138 (failing to incorporate paragraphs 1 and 264-273).) However, the class is mentioned in many of the counts, and the only plausible reading of the TAC as a whole is that all claims are being brought by Plaintiffs individually and on behalf of the class.

fn 
14
The district court in In re Schering-Plough Corp. also stated: "The gravamen of Plaintiffs' theory of injury is that they suffered economic loss where the price of the Subject Drugs increased as a result of misrepresentations made by [defendant] in the off-label promotion of [the drugs]. This is, by definition, a fraud-on-the-market theory and one which is not cognizable under RICO." [2009 BL 148399], 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58900 , 2009 WL 2043604 , at *21-22. This language is directly applicable here, with the simple substitution of real estate for drugs.

fn 
15
It appears Plaintiffs are also attempting to eliminate factual distinctions between the TAC and the complaint in Lester v. Percudani, 556 F. Supp. 2d 473 (M.D. Pa. 2008), which the Court distinguished in its Order dismissing the SAC. (See Doc. 282 at 20; Doc. 268 at 5-6.) However, as explained below, Lester remains distinguishable.

fn 
16
The Court previously expressed concern that "[i]t is difficult to fathom how Plaintiffs could purport to bring this action on behalf of all purchasers of Ginn properties over an unspecified time period if they are not relying on a fraud-on-the-market theory." (Doc. 259 at 14-15.) Otherwise, it is obvious that this case is not maintainable as a class action. See, e.g., Burstein v. First Penn-Pacific Life Ins. Co., 209 F.R.D. 674 , 677 (S.D. Fla. 2002); Gibbs Props. Corp. v. Cigna Corp., 196 F.R.D. 430 , 440 (M.D. Fla 2000).

fn 
17
Additionally, the TAC adds a breach of fiduciary duty claim. Plaintiffs presumably add this claim, which involves trust and confidence allegedly placed in employees of the bank Defendants, in an attempt to analogize this case with Acciard v. Whitney, Case No. 2:07-cv-476-UA-DNF, [2008 BL 270199], 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98131 , 2008 WL 5120898 (M.D. Fla. Dec. 4, 2008). However, as explained below, Acciard remains distinguishable.

fn 
18
For example, the TAC merely gives multiple examples of alleged misconduct in the recording of sales, which in turn allegedly affected appraisals. ( Id. at 49-51.) The TAC also gives multiple examples of alleged misconduct involved in the appraisals of certain properties, which in turn affected subsequent appraisals of other properties. ( Id. at 54-57.) Thus, as the Court noted in dismissing the SAC, "it appears that any causal connection stems solely from the fact that Plaintiffs' purchases occurred after the allegedly fraudulent recordings. Under this reasoning, essentially any purchaser who bought a property downstream from a Defendant's purported misrepresentation paid a fraudulently inflated price as a result of fraud." (Doc. 268 at 5) (citations omitted). The Court has already determined that this type of causal connection is too attenuated to support Plaintiffs' claims. (See  id. at 5-7).

fn 
19
For example, Plaintiffs largely relied on standard sales materials, presentations, and literature, plus three-dimensional models, DVDs, price lists, opinions of salespeople, etc. (See Doc. 272 at 18-40.)

fn 
20
The undersigned notes that Plaintiffs' separate discussions of the same topic nearly 50 pages apart is indicative of Plaintiffs' manner of pleading throughout this action. This is more than simply a defect of form. This type of pleading, whether intentional or not, is obfuscatory.

fn 
21
The Court has warned Plaintiffs several times to avoid this type of unnecessarily detailed "factual enhancement." (See, e.g., Doc. 139 at 12-13.)

fn 
22
The undersigned recommends that the Court's detailed discussion of this problem with the FAC is equally applicable to the TAC and therefore incorporates that discussion by reference herein. (See Doc. 139 at 10-13.)

fn 
23
Although Plaintiffs attempt to distinguish all fraud-on-the-market cases on their facts, the undersigned has reviewed the relevant cases cited by both sides and is unconvinced that those cases, which essentially dealt with an inflated price theory, are distinguishable.

fn 
24
Plaintiffs are clearly attempting to "avoid[] unworkable difficulties in ascertaining what amount of the plaintiff's injury was caused by the defendant's wrongful action as opposed to other external factors," as their "losses came in the wake of a downturn in the real estate market." See First Nationwide Bank v. Gelt Funding Corp., 27 F.3d 763 , 770 (2d Cir. 1994) (dismissing a real estate RICO claim for lack of causation following a downturn in the market). See also Stein v. Paradigm Mirasol, LLC, 586 F.3d 849 , 852 (11th Cir. 2009) ("There was a sharp upward swing in housing prices between late 2000 and the end of 2005, and the resulting bubble was bigger in Florida than it was in most other states. . . . All bubbles eventually burst, as this one did.") Accordingly, with the exception of a few insufficient, conclusory allegations (see, e.g., Doc. 272 at 21, 23, 28), the TAC is largely silent as to what actually happened to Plaintiffs' properties and how much money, if any, each Plaintiff actually lost on his or her investment(s).

fn 
25
It is noteworthy that Dura was a unanimous opinion authored by Justice Breyer.

fn 
26
This theory also protects investors from simply making a bad deal by paying above "fair market value" for a piece of property as a result of many potential factors other than fraud.

fn 
27
Plaintiffs actually cite Lester v. Percudani, [2008 BL 241072], 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 91202 , 2008 WL 4722749 (M.D. Pa. Oct. 24, 2008) in their Responses. However, that opinion incorporates the detailed facts from the published decision, Lester, 556 F. Supp. 2d. at 473 . Therefore, the undersigned will address the published decision.

fn 
28
The additional cases cited by Plaintiff in this regard are also distinguishable because they do not involve RICO claims. Therefore, the causation scrutiny required in RICO cases did not apply in those cases.

fn 
29
"It shall be unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any of the provisions of subsection (a) , (b) , or (c) of this section." 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d) .

fn 
30
While not previously addressed at length, the Court has noted the likelihood of the application of Dura to Plaintiffs' theory of damages. (Doc. 259 at 17 n.21.)

fn 
31
Even if Plaintiffs were to abandon their class allegations, for all of the reasons discussed herein, including the TAC's prolixity and inapplicable theories of causation and damages, the undersigned would still recommend dismissal with prejudice.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION 
TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
This matter comes before the Court on Plaintiff David Smith's Complaint (Doc. #1), filed on May 3, 2011, seeking review of the final decision of the Commissioner of the Social Security (Commissioner) denying Plaintiff's claim for Disability Insurance Benefits and Supplemental Security Income. Plaintiff filed his Memorandum of Law in support of the Complaint (Doc. #16) on September 8, 2011. The Commissioner filed the Transcript of the proceedings (hereinafter referred to as "Tr." followed by the appropriate page number). The Commissioner filed the Memorandum of Law in support of the Commissioner's decision (Doc. #17) on November 7, 2011. Thus, the case is now ripe for review.
The Court has reviewed the record, including a transcript of the proceedings before the Administrative Law Judge, the exhibits filed and administrative record, and the pleadings and memoranda submitted by the parties in this case.
I. Social Security Act Eligibility, Procedural History, and Standard of Review 
A. Social Security Act Eligibility 
The law defines disability as the inability to do any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve months. 42 U.S.C. § 416(I) , 423(d)(1); 20 C.F.R. § 404.1505 . The impairment must be severe, making Plaintiff unable to do her previous work, or any other substantial gainful activity which exists in the national economy. 42 U.S.C. § 423(d)(2) ; 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1505-404.1511 .
B. Procedural History 
On May 14, 2007, Plaintiff filed an application for Disability Insurance Benefits ("DIB"). Plaintiff also filed an application for Supplemental Security Income ("SSI") on April 5, 2007. In both applications Plaintiff alleged disability beginning May 5, 2006. (Tr. 20). His claims were initially denied on July 3, 2007, and upon reconsideration on November 29, 2007. On September 4, 2009, a hearing was held in Tampa before Administrative Law Judge ("ALJ") Richard E. Ouellette. (Tr. 18). The ALJ's decision, dated February 10, 2010, denied Plaintiff's request for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income. (Tr. 18-30). The Appeals Council denied Plaintiff's Request for Review on July 26, 2011. (Tr. 1-3). Therefore, the decision of the ALJ is final.
C. Standard of Review 
The scope of this Court's review is limited to determining whether the ALJ applied the correct legal standards, and whether the findings are supported by substantial evidence. Hibbard v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 91216 , 2007 WL 4365647 at *2 (M.D. Fla. Dec. 12, 2007) ([*2] citing Richardson v. Perales, 402 U.S. 389 , 390 , 91 S.Ct. 1420 , 28 L. Ed. 2d 842 (1971); McRoberts v. Bowen, 841 F.2d 1077 , 1080 (11th Cir. 1988)). In evaluating whether a claimant is disabled, the ALJ must follow the sequential inquiry described in the regulations 1 ( 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520(a) , 404.920(a)). The Commissioner's findings of fact are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence ( 42 U.S.C. § 405(g) ). "Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla — i.e., the evidence must do more than merely create a suspicion of the existence of a fact, and must include such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support the conclusion." Hibbard, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 91216 , 2007 WL 4365647 at 2 (citing Foote v. Chater, 67 F.3d 1553 , 1560 (11th Cir. 1995) (citing Walden v. Schweiker, 672 F.2d 835 (11th Cir. 1982)); Richardson, 402 U.S. 389 at 401 , 91 S. Ct. 1420 , 28 L. Ed. 2d 842 .
Where the Commissioner's decision is supported by substantial evidence, the District Court will affirm, even if the reviewer would have reached a contrary result as finder of fact, and even if the reviewer finds that the evidence preponderates against the Commissioner's decision. Phillips v. Barnhart, 357 F.3d 1232 , 1240 (11th Cir. 2004). The District Court must view the evidence as a whole, taking into account evidence favorable as well as unfavorable to the decision. Foote, 67 F.3d 1553 at 1560 ; Lowery v. Sullivan, 979 F.2d 835 , 837 (11th Cir. 1992) (holding the court must scrutinize the entire record to determine reasonableness of factual findings).
The Court "may not decide the facts anew, reweigh the evidence, or substitute [its] judgment for that of the [Commissioner]." Phillips, 357 F.3d at 1240 n.8; Dyer v. Barnhart, 395 F.3d 1206 , 1210 (11th Cir. 2005). If the Commissioner's decision is supported by substantial evidence, it should not be disturbed. Lewis v. Callahan, 125 F.3d 1436 , 1439 (11th Cir. 1997).
II Review of Facts 
A. Background Facts 
On the date of the ALJ's decision, Plaintiff was 47 years old. (Tr. 21). Plaintiff only completed the 7th grade, but he is able to read and write. (Tr. 21). Plaintiff said he never received a GED, but a consultative examination reported that he did. (Tr. 21). Plaintiff previously worked as a security guard, but he quit due to his back pain. (Tr. 25 ).
Plaintiff alleges he became disabled on May 5, 2006, due to debilitating back, leg and hip pain. (Tr. 20-21). Plaintiff used to enjoy martial arts, soccer, riding dirt bikes, jogging, working on cars, doing yard work, hunting and fishing, but now is unable to perform these activities because of his back and leg pain. (Tr. 21). Plaintiff also claims he is unable to perform these activities because he has problems with his memory and must be reminded to take his medications. (Tr. 21). At the time of this claim, Plaintiff described being unable to lift, squat, bend, stand, reach, walk, sit, kneel, climb stairs, complete tasks, concentrate, understand, use his hands or get along with others. (Tr. 21). However, Plaintiff is still able to prepare sandwiches, heat up food in a microwave, drive an automatic vehicle, leave home by himself, and manage money. (Tr. 21).
B. The ALJ's Findings 
At step one, the ALJ found Plaintiff has not engaged in substantial gainful activity since May 5, 2006. (Tr. 20). Although Plaintiff earned $10,448.53 for 2006, he stopped working in May of 2006 and his wages represent "a lot of hours." (Tr. 20). The ALJ found that even though Plaintiff made money for part of 2006, it did [*3] not rise to the level of substantial gainful activity, as defined in the Social Security Act. (Tr. 20-21).
At step two, the ALJ found that Plaintiff has severe impairments including: 1) degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine; 2) lumbar radiculopathy; 3) cervical degenerative disc disease; 4) lumbar spondylosis; 5) bursitis; and 6) adjustment disorder with depressed mood. (Tr. 21). Plaintiff has a strained family relationship due to physical and financial problems, and has a history of drinking alcohol that resulted in a DUI almost 20 years ago. (Tr. 21). Plaintiff also has a past history of substance abuse in the 1980s. (Tr. 21). Plaintiff has a limited ability to perform activities of daily living due to his low back pain and stiffness, along with neck pain that causes headaches. (Tr. 21). Plaintiff is unable to shave, button or fasten clothes, vacuum, do dishes or bend to get laundry out of a dryer. (Tr. 22).
At step three, the ALJ found that Plaintiff does not have an impairment or combination of impairments that meet or medically equal one of the listed impairments in 20 C.F.R. Part 404 , Subpart P, Appendix 1 ( 20 C.F.R. § § 404.1525 , 404.1526, 416.920(d), 416.925 and 416.926). (Tr. 22). The ALJ determined after reviewing all of the medical evidence that there was no medical reason or explanation from any treating source that Plaintiff is totally disabled. (Tr. 22). Moreover, the ALJ found that the evidence of record establishes there is no compelling objective evidence to substantiate Plaintiff's allegations of being unable to perform any type of work activity. (Tr. 22).
The ALJ found Plaintiff's mental impairment does not meet or medically equal the criteria of listing 12.06. (Tr. 22). In making this finding the ALJ considered whether "paragraph B" criteria are satisfied, and found that they are not. (Tr. 22). Although Plaintiff has mild nerve problems, he has never been given psychotropic medication. (Tr. 22). The ALJ found that evidence does not demonstrate motor tension, autonomic hyperactivity, vigilance and scanning, apprehensive expectation, persistent irrational fear, severe panic attacks or recurrent obsessions and compulsions. (Tr. 22). Thus the ALJ found that while Plaintiff has mild symptoms of depression, it is not a condition which has incapacitated Plaintiff for a prolonged period of time. (Tr. 22).
The ALJ found Plaintiff has no restrictions in activities of daily living and is able to get out of bed every morning, perform limited chores around the house, shop, drive a car, and go to the doctor when necessary. (Tr. 23). The ALJ concluded that a person with anxiety or depression would not be able to perform these activities. (Tr. 23). Next, the ALJ found Plaintiff has moderate difficulties with regard to concentration, persistence or pace but has not been determined by a physician to be at risk of decompensation under stressful conditions. (Tr. 23). Thus because Plaintiff's mental impairments have not caused at least two limitations, the criteria for "paragraph B" is not satisfied. (Tr. 23).
At step four, the ALJ found Plaintiff has the residual functional capacity to perform the full range of sedentary work as defined [*4] in 20 CFR 404.1567(a) and 416.967(a). The ALJ also found that Plaintiff can lift no more than 10 pounds occasionally, sit for up to 6 hours in an 8 hour workday, stand and walk for no more than 2 hours in an 8 hour workday, and has a frequent limitation for climbing and working at unprotected heights and an occasional limitation for bending, stooping, crouching and kneeling. (Tr. 23). The ALJ determined Plaintiff is able to perform routine tasks in an environment that allows for sit-stand option. (Tr. 23). In making this finding the ALJ concludes Plaintiff can perform simple unskilled work and has the ability to get along with supervisors, employees and the general public and furthermore, Plaintiff is not at risk of decompensation under stress. (Tr. 26).
At step five, the ALJ found Plaintiff is unable to perform any past relevant work. (Tr. 28). The vocational expert testified that Plaintiff's past work as a security guard is classified as light semiskilled work, and thus Plaintiff is unable to perform his past work. (Tr. 28).
The ALJ also found that Plaintiff was 44 years old on the date of the application and is defined as a younger individual. (Tr. 28). Further, Plaintiff has a limited education but can read and write in English. (Tr. 28). Although Plaintiff has work skills from past relevant work, he is unable to perform his past relevant work. (Tr. 29). A vocational expert testified that given Plaintiff's age, education, work experience, and residual functional capacity, he is able to transfer to other occupations with jobs in significant numbers in the national economy. (Tr. 29). The ALJ concluded that Plaintiff is not disabled. (Tr. 30).
C. Plaintiff's Medical History 
Plaintiff alleges his disability began in May 2006. (Tr. 20). At that point Plaintiff had to stop work because the pain was too bad to continue working. (Tr. 40). Plaintiff went to Gulf to Bay Pain Management starting in 2006 for back pain. (Tr. 147). Plaintiff had MRI scans of his back which revealed back problems. (Tr. 245-46). Plaintiff started physical therapy at that time. In August of 2006 Plaintiff first visited South Bay Diagnostics for pain management. (Tr. 148, 245). At this time, Plaintiff started a series of injections to treat his back pain. (Tr. 245). On August 1, 2006, Plaintiff went to South Bay and had two different pain medications injected into his buttocks to relieve his back pain. (Tr. 287-88).
Plaintiff sought further care for back pain and muscle spasms on September 20, 2006. (Tr. 267). Plaintiff did therapy and stretches which eased the pain although he was not able to return to his job because of the pain in his left hip. (Tr. 267).
On January 4, 2007, Plaintiff was referred to Gerald Nickerson, M.D. by Dr. Hafeez, his family physician. (Tr. 308). Dr. Nickerson found that Plaintiff had left lumbar paravertebral tenderness and severe tenderness over the left SI join. (Tr. 309). Dr. Nickerson concluded that Plaintiff had back problems, SI joint arthropathy on the left side and bursitis on the left side. (Tr. 309). Dr. Nickerson gave Plaintiff an injection in his left side and also scheduled Plaintiff for a lumbar epidural injection for January 15, 2007. (Tr. 310). [*5] On January 15, 2007, Dr. Nickerson administered a lumbar epidural injection at the L4-5 site. (Tr. 314). On January 19, 2007, Plaintiff returned to Dr. Nickerson with persistent hip pain. (Tr. 306). Dr. Nickerson found that Plaintiff responded well to the lumbar epidural injection and that Plaintiff had left SI degenerative joint disease and gave Plaintiff another SI joint injection. (Tr. 307). On January 22, 2007, Plaintiff received another left SI joint injection along with local anesthesia. (Tr. 313).
In February 2007, Plaintiff went to Dr. Nickerson. Plaintiff said he was involved in a boating accident in the past, and then he has had back and hip problems that have continually worsened. (Tr. 263). On February 6, 2007, Plaintiff returned to Dr. Nickerson stating that he was doing better since his epidural steroid injection for his back pain and his sacroilliac joint injection on his left side for hip pain. (Tr. 304). Dr. Nickerson noted tightness in Plaintiff's hamstrings, referred him to physical therapy, and proscribed vicodin for pain. (Tr. 305). On February 20, 2007, Plaintiff told Dr. Nickerson his pain was starting to decrease but was exacerbated by prolonged sitting and the deep tissue massages that were part of his physical therapy. (Tr. 303).
On March 6, 2007, Plaintiff went to Dr. Nickerson with left hip pain that was radiating through his leg. (Tr. 302). Plaintiff was scheduled for an SI joint injection and instructed to discontinue physical therapy. (Tr. 302). On March 15, 2007, Plaintiff received a sacroiliac joint injection in his left side through a spinal needle. (Tr. 312). On March 27, 2007, Plaintiff stated that his pain had improved since the injection, and he is still on various pain medications. (Tr. 301). Dr. Nickerson noted Plaintiff continued to have degenerative joint disease, opioid dependence, and bursitis on his left side. (Tr. 301).
On April 10, 2007, Plaintiff was seen by Dr. Nickerson for his left hip pain and his low back pain. (Tr. 300). Plaintiff stated that his hip pain is exacerbated by prolonged sitting, while his low back pain is exacerbated by prolonged standing. (Tr. 300). Dr. Nickerson found that Plaintiff had tenderness to palpitations over his left side and that he had signs of joint arthropathy and degenerative joint disease. (Tr. 300). On April 25, 2007, Plaintiff went to Dr. Nickerson and said his low back pain had "improved dramatically." (Tr. 298). This was immediately after Dr. Nickerson completed a left greater trochanteric bursa injection which involved inserting a needle with a cocktail of medications into his left hip. (Tr. 299). Afterwards, Plaintiff felt that he could discontinue taking MS Contin (an oral form of morphine), even though he stated he continued to have left thigh pain along with left hip pain. (Tr. 298).
In May 2007, Plaintiff returned to South Bay Hospital where Plaintiff told medical staff he had no physical limitations prior to a boating accident. According to Plaintiff, it was after this accident that he started having problems with back and hip pain on his left side. (Tr. 263). Plaintiff reported hip pain on his left side with a cramping [*6] pain all the way down his thigh to his ankle. (Tr. 262). Plaintiff was given specific exercises and stretches to perform. (Tr. 262). Later that month, Plaintiff participated in physical therapy consisting of exercises and stretches as well as an ultrasound to the left hip. (Tr. 261). At the end of month, on May 23, 2007 Plaintiff had an appointment with Dr. Nickerson who found that Plaintiff had a full range of motion on flexion, extension, rotation and lateral flexion, but that he had a pain trigger point in his left gluteus. (Tr. 297). Plaintiff was to continue his pain medication, viocodin and continue with physical therapy and other therapeutic exercises. (Tr. 297).
On July 3, 2007, Plaintiff's medical file was assessed by Brian Pulling, a disability examiner 2, for a physical residual functional capacity assessment. (Tr. 315-22). Pulling determined Plaintiff was not disabled, although he did have a back disorder and degenerative discs. (Tr. 77). Pulling found that Plaintiff was improving with physical therapy and he felt the bursitis and SI joint arthropathy was resolved. (Tr. 316). On July 17, 2007, Plaintiff was admitted to South Bay Hospital for epidural injections at the L4-5 interspace. (Tr. 329). Plaintiff was discharged and asked to return in two weeks for a repeat procedure. (Tr. 329). On July 31, 2007, Plaintiff was again admitted to South Bay Hospital, placed under anesthesia and given epidural injections. (Tr. 327).
On August 14, 2007, Plaintiff was admitted to South Bay Hospital for injections. (Tr. 326). Plaintiff was admitted for lumbar degenerative disk disease with left lower extremity radiculopathy. (Tr. 326). Plaintiff was treated by being placed under sedation for a left side L4-5 interlaminar epidural injection and fluoroscopic guidance. (Tr. 326).
In September 2007, Plaintiff filled out an SSA Function Report. (Tr. 211-218). Plaintiff detailed his typical day which included taking medication, feeding fish, taking a bath, resting on the couch and once or twice a week doing dishes and folding some clothes. (Tr. 211). Plaintiff also noted that he cannot sleep more than a few hours without having to get up to change positions. (Tr. 212). In addition, after certain procedures such as spinal injections for pain management he is unable to dress, bathe or care for himself. (Tr. 212). Other than the days surrounding these procedures, Plaintiff can do some light household chores such as putting away dishes. (Tr. 213). On September 11, 2007, Plaintiff went to South Bay Hospital for an MRI of the spine because of neck pain. (Tr. 330). Plaintiff was found to have mild cervical spondylosis at C4 and C5 with slight impingement on the neural forament on the left, and there was no evidence of disk herniation. (Tr. 330). On September 20, 2007, Plaintiff filled out forms for the SSA detailing his pain symptoms, medications and the effects on his day-to-day life. (Tr. 230-33). In these forms, Plaintiff stated he was in pain 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. (Tr. 231). He also noted that he has difficulty washing his lower extremities, tying shoes, standing up and even lying down. (Tr. 232). Furthermore, he is unable to take care [*7] of his family's home, maintain their yard and has difficulty getting into and out of cars. (Tr. 232). Plaintiff also notes he is on three different medications, two of which have to be taken three times a day in an attempt to manage his pain. (Tr. 231).
On October 30, 2007, Plaintiff received an epidural steroid injection because of his back and hip pain. Plaintiff was diagnosed with having cervical degenerative disk disease with upper extremity radiculopathy. (Tr. 417).
On November 7, 2007, Plaintiff was referred to John T. Super, Ph.D. by the Office of Disability Determinations to gather information to assist the determination of his disability. (Tr. 332). Dr. Super interviewed Plaintiff and found that there were no symptoms suggestive of psychotic processes, he was able to recall sequences after presentation, he understood common sayings and had no features of anxiety. (Tr. 334). Dr. Super found Plaintiff was competent to handle his finances (mentally) after asking him simple math questions involving making change. (Tr. 335). Dr. Super concluded by noting the Plaintiff reported being unable to engage in previously enjoyed activities because of his back pain and depression. (Tr. 335). On November 15, 2007, Plaintiff's file was reviewed by Jim Andriole, D.O., and Plaintiff was determined to be not disabled, although again it was found he had a back disorder and degenerative discs, as well as migraines. (Tr. 336-45). On November 27, 2007, Plaintiff went to Gulf-to-Bay and received a transforaminal ESI injection at his L4 and L5 discs and was diagnosed with disc disease. (Tr. 416). On November 28, 2007, Plaintiff's file was reviewed by Robin McCallister, Ph.D. for a psychiatric review. (Tr. 346-59). Dr. McCallister found Plaintiff had an impairment that was related to a medical issue; that Plaintiff had ETOH abuse in partial remission; that Plaintiff had no restriction of activities of daily living, but that Plaintiff had mild difficulties in maintaining social function and concentration, persistence or pace. (Tr. 346-59). Dr. McCallister concluded based on review of Plaintiff's file that he needs no reminders for self-care; that he does have physical limitations but helps with light chores and limited meal preparations, and that the majority of any disruptions in concentration are due to his pain and pain medications. (Tr. 358).
In December 2007, Plaintiff had an MRI of the lumbar spine at South Bay Hospital. (Tr. 397). The MRI found that there L1-2, L2-3 and L3-4 discs were "unremarkable," but at L4-5 there was a mild desiccation of the disc, and a bulge which produced a mild narrowing of the right lateral recess. (Tr. 397). It also found that at the level of L5-S1 there were mild degenerative changes of the facet joints. (Tr. 397).
On April 2, 2008, Plaintiff went to Willem Nel, M.D. for injections at three different locations in his spine as well as a left hip injection. (Tr. 414). On April 16, 2008, Plaintiff went to South Bay Hospital for a sciatic nerve root injection. (Tr. 413). On April 30, 2008, Plaintiff underwent injections again at the L3-L4, L4-L5, L5-S1 lumbar facet joints as well as the left SI joint. (Tr. 410). Plaintiff [*8] was instructed to return in 2 weeks for another round of injections. (Tr. 410).
On May 14, 2008, Plaintiff returned to South Bay Hospital for more injections, this time he was given injections under sedation at the L3-L4, L4-L5, L5-S1, and the left SI joint. (Tr. 407). Plaintiff was discharged and returned in 2 weeks for a repeat procedure. (Tr. 407).
In August 2008, Plaintiff went to Dr. Nel and was diagnosed with sciatica and given a sciatic nerve injection. (Tr. 408). In July 2009, Plaintiff went to Tampa General Hospital with back and hip pain. (Tr. 400-05). Plaintiff was seen by Dr. Nel. (Tr. 400). Plaintiff was found to have sacroilitis and had a lumbar facet joint injection as well as a sacroiliac joint injection performed under sedation. (Tr. 401). Plaintiff was instructed to return in two weeks for a repeat procedure. (Tr. 401).
In August 2009, Plaintiff went for another MRI on his spine. (Tr. 453-54). Plaintiff was found to have some loss of intervertebral disc signal at the L4-L5 level, which is consistent with degenerative disc desiccation. (Tr. 453). Other than that, there was no finding of disc protrusions or extrusions. (Tr. 453).
Plaintiff testified during his hearing before the ALJ on September 4, 2009, that he was 47 years old and lives with his wife and eight year old daughter. (Tr. 39). Plaintiff testified he had to stop work on or about May 5, 2006, because his pain was too bad for him to continue. (Tr. 40). Plaintiff explained that he can no longer maintain their home, has difficulty climbing the steps to his home and sometimes has to use two feet at a time on each step because of the pain and aggravation it causes to his left side. (Tr. 41-42). Plaintiff testified he is able to drive for short periods of time and typically drives two to three times a week to check on his mother who lives a couple of miles away. (Tr. 42). Plaintiff used to drive a standard transmission but was forced to change to automatic transmission because he can no longer operate a clutch. (Tr. 43). Plaintiff explained that if he sits more than 20 minutes in his car he gets "locked up" and cannot move and it takes more than 20 minutes for him to be able to move again. (Tr. 43-44). Plaintiff also has shooting pains in his leg if he presses the brakes too many times. (Tr. 43). Plaintiff described headaches that cause vision problems, and said he has difficulty writing because of the pain in his neck which causes tremors in his hands. (Tr. 44). Plaintiff testified that he has pain in his lower back all day, everyday and that it continues to get progressively worse. (Tr. 49). At the time of his testimony, Plaintiff said the pain has moved from the left to the center and the right hand side of his body, and that he had just had injections on his right side less that two weeks prior to the hearing. (Tr. 49). Plaintiff testified he cannot stand more than 45 minutes without having to sit because of pain, and that even when he is standing he needs to move around. (Tr. 51-52). During the hearing, Plaintiff had to stand to continue testifying due to pain from sitting too long. (Tr. 52). Plaintiff discussed his typical day which starts off with a hot bath because in the mornings he is dizzy [*9] and unable to stand for a shower. (Tr. 54). Plaintiff also testified that he is on four medications: he takes vicodin four times a day; ultram three times a day; elavil once every night, and a muscle relaxer three times a day. (Tr. 55).
Plaintiff's wife, Jackie Smith, also testified at the hearing. (Tr. 68-73). Ms. Smith testified that Plaintiff can no longer work or support the family; that he lays down three to four times a day and spends the majority of the day in a recliner. (Tr. 69-70).
A vocational expert, Theresa Manning testified. (Tr. 72-75). Ms. Manning's testimony was based solely on a review of Plaintiff's file. (Tr. 72-73). Ms. Manning testified that based upon the ALJ's hypothetical and determination, Plaintiff can perform sedentary work, and there are jobs that the Plaintiff can perform. (Tr. 74). Ms. Manning further testified that examples of these types of jobs include security monitor, telephone solicitor, and final assembler, all of which are available locally and nationally. (Tr. 74). In response to questioning by Plaintiff's counsel, Ms. Manning testified that if Plaintiff's hand tremors were taken into account it would eliminate the final assembler position, and if you take into account the fact Plaintiff needs to lie down at least one or two times during the workday from anywhere between 30 and 60 minutes in addition to be unable to attend work for more than 2 days per month (due to spinal injections) it eliminates Plaintiff's ability to perform any job. (Tr. 75).
III Specific Issues and Conclusion of Law 
Plaintiff raises five issues on appeal. As stated by Plaintiff, they are: (1) the ALJ erroneously found Plaintiff's testimony less credible based on Plaintiff's ability to perform daily activities; (2) the ALJ failed to consider the combined effect of all impairments; (3) the ALJ erred in determining Plaintiff's RFC; (4) the ALJ erred by engaging in "sit and squirm jurisprudence;" and, (5) the ALJ erred in failing to make a proper credibility finding as to Plaintiff's testimony, and erred in improperly discrediting Plaintiff's complaints of pain and subjective symptoms.
A. Whether the ALJ Erroneously Found Plaintiff's Testimony Less Credible Based on Plaintiff's Ability to Perform Daily Activities. 
Plaintiff argues that the ALJ committed error by considering Plaintiff's testimony less credible based on the fact Plaintiff can perform limited daily activities. (Doc. 16, p. 4). The Commissioner argues that the Eleventh Circuit indicates it is appropriate to consider Plaintiff's daily activities in evaluating allegations of disabling pain. (Doc. 17, p. 5).
Credibility determinations are within the province of the ALJ. Moore v. Barnhart, 405 F.3d 1208 , 1212 (11th Cir. 2005). If a claimant testifies as to his subjective complaints of disabling pain and other symptoms, the ALJ must clearly articulate explicit and adequate reasons for discrediting claimant's allegations; though the ALJ need not make explicit finding as to credibility, the implication must be obvious to the reviewing court. Dyer v. Barnhart, 395 F.3d 1206 , 1210 (11th Cir. 2005). In making an assessment of credibility of claimant's subjective [*10] complaints of disabling pain and other symptoms, the ALJ need not cite any particular phrases or formulations, but the ALJ's determination cannot be merely a broad rejection, which is insufficient to enable reviewing court to conclude the ALJ considered claimant's medical condition as whole. Dyer, at 1210. If a Plaintiff testifies as to his subjective complaints of disabling pain and other symptoms, the ALJ must clearly "articulate explicit and adequate reasons" for discrediting the claimant's allegations of completely disabling symptoms. Foote, at 1561-62.
In this case, the ALJ took in account Plaintiff's subjective complaints as well as the medical evidence in determining Plaintiff's credibility. The ALJ systematically articulated his reasons for rejecting Plaintiff's subjective complaints of pain. The ALJ addressed Plaintiff's complaints of pain by addressing Plaintiff's description of being unable to lift, squat, bend, stand, reach, walk, sit, kneel, climb stairs, complete tasks, concentrate, understand, use his hands or get along with others. (Tr. 21). The ALJ also found that Plaintiff (according to Plaintiff's own testimony) is able to prepare light meals, heat up food in the microwave, leave his home alone, drive, go grocery shopping with his spouse, and handle money. The ALJ even acknowledged that Plaintiff cannot perform certain chores such as shaving, buttoning or fastening clothing, vacuuming, dishwashing and bending to get laundry out of the dryer. (Tr. 22). The ALJ considered Dr. Super's evaluation and Plaintiff's own testimony that Plaintiff can wash counters, fold blankets, shop with his mother one to two times a week, and drive three to four times a week. (Tr. 335). Based on this information, the ALJ properly found Plaintiff's level of activity was inconsistent with his allegation of debilitating limitations.
Moreover, Plaintiff's own testimony and daily activities were not the ALJ's sole basis for finding Plaintiff's testimony less than credible. The ALJ relied on an MRI taken in August 2009 that revealed early stages of degenerative disc disease but that there was no evidence of spinal stenosis, disc protrusions, extrusions or spondylolisthesis. (Tr. 25, 453). The ALJ also found based on doctors' reports and Plaintiff's testimony that pain medications, injections and physical therapy were relatively effective in treating Plaintiff's pain. (Tr. 28, 261, 297, 298, 300, 306, 361).
In sum the ALJ considered Plaintiff's daily living activities and concluded that Plaintiff's testimony does not support a finding of total disability. The ALJ took into consideration Plaintiff's subjective testimony as well as objective medical reports in deciding the weight to give each. (Tr. 21-30). The ALJ explicitly addressed Plaintiff's pain as well as Plaintiff's own testimony as to his range of abilities in the ALJ's opinion. The Court finds the ALJ did not err in finding Plaintiff's testimony less credible based on Plaintiff's ability to perform daily activities.
B. Whether the ALJ Failed to Consider the Combined Effect of all Impairments.[*11] 
Plaintiff argues that the ALJ failed to consider the combined effect of all of Plaintiff's impairments, and instead summarily stated Plaintiff's impairments did not meet or medically equal a listed impairment and provided no analysis or discussion. (Doc. 16, p. 5).
The Commissioner argues the ALJ took all impairments into account and that his statement sufficiently reflects proper consideration of Plaintiff's impairments. (Doc. 17, p. 8). The Commissioner claims the ALJ discussed all of Plaintiff's physical and mental impairments in singly and in combination as well as their impact on Plaintiff's ability to work. (Doc. 17, p. 9).
When an ALJ states in his decision that "based upon a thorough consideration of all evidence, the ALJ concludes that appellant is not suffering from any impairment, or a combination of impairments," it is clear the ALJ considered the combination issue. Wheeler v. Heckler, 784 F.2d 1073 , 1076 (11th Cir. 1986).
In this case, the ALJ made a finding that, "The claimant does not have an impairment or combination of impairments that meets or medically equals one of the listed impairments..." According to Wheeler this statement is sufficient to determine that the ALJ did take into account each impairment and a combination of impairments. In his opinion, the ALJ went through each of Plaintiff's impairments (mental impairment, mild nerve problems, daily living, mild social functioning difficulties, moderate difficulties in concentration, persistence and pace, and any episodes of decompensation) and considered and explained his finding for each in determining Plaintiff's RFC. (Tr. 22-23). The Court finds the ALJ did consider both singly and in combination the effects of Plaintiff's impairments, and therefore did not err in his determinations.
C. Whether the ALJ Erred in Determining Plaintiff's RFC. 
Plaintiff argues the ALJ erred in determining Plaintiff's RFC because the RFC failed to include Plaintiff's side effects from his medications, including drowsiness, dizziness, decreased grip strength, and his memory difficulties, and that the ALJ erred by not incorporating these into a hypothetical to the VE. (Doc. 16, p. 7). The Commissioner argues the ALJ referenced each of Plaintiff's allegations and concluded that they did not reach the intensity or persistence to the extent alleged, and the ALJ was therefore not required to include these allegations in the RFC finding or in a hypothetical to a VE. (Doc. 17, p. 9).
An ALJ is not required to include findings in the hypothetical to a vocational expert that he has rejected as unsupported. Crawford v. Commissioner of Social Security, 363 F.3d 1155 , 1161 (11th Cir. 2004). In this case, the ALJ addressed each of Plaintiff's side effects in his opinion and found that Plaintiff's medically determinable impairments could reasonably be expected to cause the alleged symptoms; but that Plaintiff's statements concerning the intensity, persistence and limiting effects of these symptoms. (Tr. 27). The ALJ found Plaintiff's subjective complaints about these side effects to be unsupported and thus according to Crawford was not [*12] required to include these symptoms in a hypothetical to the VE.
Furthermore, state agency psychological consultants completed a Physical Residual Functional Capacity and found that Plaintiff had a residual functional capacity for light work with no limitations. (Tr. 27, 338-345). The ALJ determined Plaintiff could perform sedentary work in an environment that allows for a sit stand option. (Tr. 23). The ALJ made this finding to allow Plaintiff to sit or stand as needed to help reduce any back or hip pain. The Court finds the ALJ did not err in determining Plaintiff's RFC.
D. Whether the ALJ Erred by Engaging in "sit and squirm jurisprudence." 
Plaintiff argues the ALJ erred by relying on his personal observations of Plaintiff at the hearing. (Doc. 16, p. 8). The Commissioner argues that Plaintiff's appearance and levels of activity were not the ALJ's sole basis for finding Plaintiff's testimony less than credible. (Doc. 17, p. 6).
An ALJ is not prohibited from considering Plaintiff's appearance and demeanor during the hearing. Macia v. Bowen, 829 F.2d 1009 , 1011 (11th Cir. 1987). Here, as in Macia, the ALJ did note Plaintiff's demeanor but did not discredit his testimony solely on that basis. Rather the ALJ clearly stated other factors, such as medical evidence and doctors' findings regarding the credibility of Plaintiff's subjective allegations in comparison to the objective medical evidence. (Tr. 27). The Court finds the ALJ did not err in commenting on Plaintiff's appearance and demeanor while testifying because this was just one of the many factors the ALJ considered in determining Plaintiff's RFC.
E. Whether the ALJ Erred in Failing to Make a Proper Credibility Finding as to Plaintiff's Testimony, and Erred in Improperly Discrediting Plaintiff's Complaints of Pain and Subjective Symptoms. 

Plaintiff argues the ALJ erred in speculatively finding that Plaintiff exaggerated his symptoms and limitations in order to increase the potential of receiving disability benefits. (Doc. 16, p. 9). The Commissioner argues that the ALJ did consider objective medical evidence and information from Plaintiff and treating physicians as well as other factors when making his decision. (Doc. 17, p. 4).
In order to establish a disability based on testimony of pain and other symptoms, the Plaintiff must satisfy two parts of a three-part test showing: 1) evidence of an underlying medical condition; and 2) either (a) objective medical evidence confirming severity of the alleged pain; or (b) the objectively determined medical condition can reasonably be expected to give rise to the claimed pain. Wilson v. Barnhart, 284 F.3d 1219 , 1225 (11th Cir. 2002). If the ALJ discredits subjective testimony, he must articulate explicit and adequate reasons for doing so. Id. Failure to articulate reasons for discrediting subjective testimony requires, as a matter of law, that the testimony be accepted as true. Cannon v. Bowen, 858 F.2d 1541 , 1545 (11th Cir. 1988).
In this case the ALJ addressed the pain test set forth in Wilson and then articulated his reasons for discrediting Plaintiff's testimony as to the intensity, persistence and limiting [*13] effects of Plaintiff's symptoms. The ALJ starts with laying out the two-part pain test from Wilson and concludes that, "After careful consideration of the evidence, the undersigned finds that the claimant's medically determinable impairments could reasonably be expected to cause the alleged symptoms; however, the claimant's statements concerning the intensity, persistence and limiting effects of these symptoms are not credible to the extent they are inconsistent with the above residual functional capacity assessment." (Tr. 27). Thus the ALJ discrediting Plaintiff's testimony only concerning the intensity, persistence and limiting effects of the pain. The ALJ then proceeds to go chronologically through both the medical evidence and Plaintiff's subjective testimony as to his pain and symptoms. (Tr. 23-28). The ALJ specifies exhibits and particular doctors' reports and notes the weight he gave to each in making his determination. The ALJ also makes observations based on Plaintiff's testimony at the hearing when the ALJ met and observed Plaintiff in person. The ALJ even details Plaintiff's subjective report as to how long he can sit, stand, walk or perform other tasks and the rest needed between such activity. (Tr. 26). The ALJ concludes, "After careful consideration of the evidence, the undersigned finds that the claimant's medically determinable impairments could reasonably be expected to cause the alleged symptoms; however, the claimant's statements concerning the intensity, persistence and limiting effects of these symptoms are not credible to the extent they are inconsistent with the above residual functional capacity assessment." (Tr. 27). Unlike Carpenter v. Astrue, where the Court held the ALJ made a credibility determination and failed to adequately explain it, the ALJ in this case detailed Plaintiff's entire medical history and specified weights accorded to doctors' findings and Plaintiffs testimony. Carpenter v. Astrue, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24852 , 2011 WL 767652 (M.D. Fla. Feb. 25, 2011). The Court finds the ALJ did not err in making a credibility finding of Plaintiff's subjective complaints because he offered explicit and clear statements regarding his reasoning.

IV. Conclusion 
The ALJ did not err in weighing Plaintiffs testimony, in considering Plaintiffs combined impairments or in determining Plaintiffs RFC. In addition the ALJ did not engage in 'sit and squirm jurisprudence,' or err in making a credibility finding as to Plaintiffs testimony.
Accordingly, it is RESPECTFULLY RECOMMENDED that:
The decision of the Commissioner be AFFIRMED pursuant to sentence four of 42 U.S.C. § 405(g) 
Failure to file written objections to the proposed findings and recommendations contained in this report within fourteen (14) days from the date of its filing shall bar an aggrieved party from attacking the factual findings on appeal.
Respectfully recommended in Chambers in Ft. Myers, Florida this 10th day of July , 2012.

The inquiry requires the ALJ to engage in a five-step analysis, which will either preclude or mandate a finding of disability. The steps are as follows:
Step 1. Is the claimant engaged in substantial gainful activity? If the claimant is engaged in such activity, then he or she is not disabled. If not, then the ALJ must move on to the next question.
Step 2. Does the claimant suffer from a severe impairment? If not, then the claimant is not disabled. If there is a severe impairment, the ALJ moves on to step three.
Step 3. Does the claimant's impairment meet or equal one of the listed impairments set forth in 20 C.F.R. Part 404 , Subpart P, Appendix 1? If so, then the claimant is disabled. If not, the next question must be resolved.
Step 4. Can the claimant perform his or her former work? If the claimant can perform his or her past relevant work, he or she is not disabled. If not, the ALJ must answer the last question.
Step 5. Can he or she engage in other work of the sort found in the national economy? If so, then the claimant is not disabled. If the claimant cannot engage in other work, then he or she is disabled. See 20 C.F.R. §§404.1520(a)-(f) , 416.920(a)-(f); see also Phillips v. Barnhart, 357 F.3d 1232 , 1237-40 (11th Cir. 2004); Foote v. Chater, 67 F.3d 1553 , 1557 (11th Cir. 1995) (per curiam).

CHARLES A. STAMPELOS 
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
This is a Social Security case referred to the undersigned magistrate judge for a report and recommendation pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b) and Local Rule 72.2(D ). It is now before the Court pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 405(g) for review of the final determination of the Acting Commissioner (Commissioner) of the Social Security Administration (SSA) denying Plaintiff's application for a period of disability and Disability Insurance Benefits (DIB) filed pursuant to Title II of the Social Security Act (Act). After consideration of the record, it is recommended that the decision of the Commissioner be reversed and the case remanded for further consideration.
I. Procedural History 
On April 12, 2012, Plaintiff, Shannon Lesli Levy, filed an application for DIB alleging disability beginning January 26, 2012, complaining of diabetes, degenerative disc disease, Graves' disease, bursitis, and overactive bladder. Tr. 27, 150-51, 166, 170. (Citations to the transcript/administrative record, ECF No. 10, shall be by the symbol "Tr." followed by a page number that appears in the lower right corner.) Plaintiff's date last insured for DIB is December 31, 2016. Tr. 27, 166.
Plaintiff's application was denied initially on May 17, 2012, and upon reconsideration on July 17, 2012. Tr. 27, 77-92. On September 11, 2012, Plaintiff requested a hearing. Tr. 27, 93-94. On February 6, 2014, Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) Thomas J. Gaye held a video hearing and presided from San Jose, California. Tr. 27, 43-76. Plaintiff appeared and testified in Gainesville, Florida, Tr. 48-71, and was represented by Elizabeth F. Stakenborg, an attorney. Tr. 27, 43, 45, 117-18, 120. Rebecca Hayes, M.Ed., L.P.C., an impartial vocational expert (VE), testified during the hearing. Tr. 27, 71-74, 143 (Resume).
On February 27, 2014, the ALJ issued a decision and denied Plaintiff's application for benefits concluding that Plaintiff was not disabled from January 26, 2012, through the date of the ALJ's decision. Tr. 27-28.
On April 15, 2014, Plaintiff requested review of the ALJ's decision and requested additional time to submit additional evidence and included a memorandum and additional patient medical records from Eric Scott, M.D., August 24, 2012, to February 10, 2014, (Tr. 466-83 (Exhibit 15F)), and Prathima Reddy, M.D., February 19, 2014.1 Tr. 4-5, 21-23, 221-24; see infra at 28-29, 36 nn. 9 & 13. On June 18, 2014, the Appeals Council granted Plaintiff's request for additional time to submit "more evidence or a statement about the facts and the law in this case" and gave Plaintiff [*2] 25 days to submit additional evidence. The Appeals Council also advised that "[a]ny more evidence must be new and material to the issues considered in the hearing decision dated February 27, 2014." Tr. 7, 14.
On September 21, 2015, the Appeals Council considered Plaintiff's request for review and mentioned Exhibits 17F, page 492, and 18F, pages 493-516, but not Exhibits 15F, pages 466-83, and 16F, pages 484-91. Tr. 1-5; see supra at n.1. The Appeals Council denied Plaintiff's request for review of the ALJ's decision making the ALJ's decision the final decision of the Commissioner. Tr. 1-5; see 20 C.F.R. § 404.981 .
On November 11, 2015, Plaintiff, by counsel, filed a Complaint with the United States District Court seeking review of the ALJ's decision. ECF No. 1. The parties filed memoranda of law, ECF Nos. 12 and 15, which have been considered.
II. Findings of the ALJ 
The ALJ made several findings relative to the issues raised in this appeal:
1. "The claimant meets the insured status requirements of the Social Security Act through December 31, 2016." Tr. 29.
2. "The claimant has not engaged in substantial gainful activity since January 26, 2012, the alleged onset date." Id. 
3. "The claimant has the following severe impairments: degenerative disc disease of the cervical spine and lumbar disc displacement." Id. The ALJ considered whether other reported impairments were severe, including diabetes, hypothyroidism, swollen left elbow, allergies and urinary incontinence, and depression, and determined they were non-severe. Tr. 29-31.
4. "The claimant does not have an impairment or combination of impairments that meets or medically equals the severity of one of the listed impairments in 20 CFR Part 404 , Subpart P, Appendix 1." Tr. 31.
5. "[T]he claimant has the residual functional capacity [RFC] to perform light work as defined in 20 CFR 404.1567(b) except that the claimant is limited to occasional climbing stairs and ramps. The claimant is limited to occasional stooping, kneeling, crouching, crawling and balancing. The claimant is limited to occasional reaching overhead with the right upper extremity. The claimant is limited to occasional pushing and pulling right arm controls using the dominant right upper extremity. The claimant must avoid concentrated exposure to extreme cold and heat. The claimant must avoid concentrated exposure to work-related hazards (unprotected heights and dangerous machinery)." Tr. 32.
6. "The claimant is unable to perform any past relevant work." Tr. 37.
7. "The claimant was born [in 1966] and was 45 years old, which is defined as a younger individual age 18-49, on the alleged disability onset date." Id. "The claimant has at least a high school education and is able to communicate in English." Id. 
8. "The claimant has acquired skills from past relevant work" as a state trooper, which has a Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT) number of 375.263-018, which the VE noted was a medium level exertional job, with a Specific Vocational Preparation (SVP) of 6 consistent with semi-skilled work. Id. 
9. "Considering the claimant's age, education, work experience, and [RFC], the claimant has acquired work skills from past relevant work that [*3] are transferable to other occupations with jobs existed in significant numbers in the national economy." Tr. 37-38. The VE testified that Plaintiff could perform representative occupations including security work with seven job titles, light exertion with an SVP of three with a representative job noted as gate guard, light exertion with an SVP of 3.2 Tr. 38.
10. "The claimant has not been under a disability, as defined in the Social Security Act, from January 26, 2012, through the date of" the ALJ's decision. Id. 

III. Legal Standards Guiding Judicial Review 
This Court must determine whether the Commissioner's decision is supported by substantial evidence in the record and premised upon correct legal principles. 42 U.S.C. § 405(g) ; Chester v. Bowen, 792 F.2d 129 , 131 (11th Cir. 1986). "Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance. It is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion." Bloodsworth v. Heckler, 703 F.2d 1233 , 1239 (11th Cir. 1983) (citations omitted); accord Moore v. Barnhart, 405 F.3d 1208 , 1211 (11th Cir. 2005). "The Commissioner's factual findings are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence." Wilson v. Barnhart, 284 F.3d 1219 , 1221 (11th Cir. 2002) (citations omitted). The court may not reweigh the evidence or substitute its own judgment for that of the ALJ even if it finds that the evidence preponderates against the ALJ's decision. Moore, 405 F.3d at 1211 .3 
"In making an initial determination of disability, the examiner must consider four factors: '(1) objective medical facts or clinical findings; (2) diagnosis of examining physicians; (3) subjective evidence of pain and disability as testified to by the claimant and corroborated by [other observers, including family members], and (4) the claimant's age, education, and work history.'" Bloodsworth, 703 F.2d at 1240 (citations omitted).
A disability is defined as a physical or mental impairment of such severity that the claimant is not only unable to do past relevant work, "but cannot, considering his age, education, and work experience, engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy." 42 U.S.C. § 423(d)(2)(A) . A disability is an "inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months." 42 U.S.C. § 423(d)(1)(A) ; see 20 C.F.R. § 404.1509 (duration requirement). Both the "impairment" and the "inability" must be expected to last not less than 12 months. Barnhart v. Walton, 535 U.S. 212 , 122 S. Ct. 1265 , 152 L. Ed. 2d 330 (2002). In addition, an individual is entitled to DIB if she is under a disability prior to the expiration of her insured status. See 42 U.S.C. § 423(a)(1)(A) ; Moore v. Barnhart, 405 F.3d at 1211 ; Torres v. Sec'y of Health & Human Servs., 845 F.2d 1136 , 1137-38 (1st Cir. 1988); Rivera v. Secretary of Health & Human Services, 818 F.2d 96 , 97 (1st Cir. 1986).
The Commissioner analyzes a claim in five steps. 20 C.F.R. § 404.1520(a)(4)(i)-(v) .
1. Is the individual currently engaged in substantial gainful activity?
2. Does the individual have any severe impairments?
3. Does the individual have any severe impairments that meet or equal those listed in Appendix 1 of 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P?
4. Does the individual have the RFC to perform work despite limitations and [*4] are there any impairments which prevent past relevant work?4 
5. Do the individual's impairments prevent other work?
A positive finding at step one or a negative finding at step two in disapproval of the application for benefits. A positive finding at step three results in approval of the application for benefits. At step four, the claimant bears the burden of establishing a severe impairment that precludes the performance of past relevant work. Consideration is given to the assessment of the claimant's RFC and the claimant's past relevant work. If the claimant can still do past relevant work, there will be a finding that the claimant is not disabled. If the claimant carries this burden, however, the burden shifts to the Commissioner at step five to establish that despite the claimant's impairments, the claimant is able to perform other work in the national economy in light of the claimant's RFC, age, education, and work experience. Phillips, 357 F.3d at 1237 ; Jones v. Apfel, 190 F.3d 1224 , 1229 (11th Cir. 1999); Chester, 792 F.2d at 131 ; MacGregor v. Bowen, 786 F.2d 1050 , 1052 (11th Cir. 1986); 20 C.F.R. § 404.1520(a)(4)(v) , (e) & (g) . If the Commissioner carries this burden, the claimant must prove that he or she cannot perform the work suggested by the Commissioner. Hale v. Bowen, 831 F.2d 1007 , 1011 (11th Cir. 1987).
The opinion of the claimant's treating physician must be accorded considerable weight by the Commissioner unless good cause is shown to the contrary. Lewis v. Callahan, 125 F.3d 1436 , 1440 (11th Cir. 1997). This is so because treating physicians "are likely to be the medical professionals most able to provide a detailed, longitudinal picture of your medical impairment(s) and may bring a unique perspective to the medical evidence that cannot be obtained from the objective medical findings alone or from reports of individual examinations, such as consultative examinations or brief hospitalizations." 20 C.F.R. § 404.1527(c)(2) . "This requires a relationship of both duration and frequency." Doyal v. Barnhart, 331 F.3d 758 , 762 (10th Cir. 2003). "'The treating physician doctrine is based on the assumption that a medical professional who has dealt with a claimant and his maladies over a long period of time will have a deeper insight into the medical condition of the claimant than will a person who has examined a claimant but once, or who has only seen the claimant's medical records.' Barker v. Shalala, 40 F.3d 789 , 794 (6th Cir. 1994) (emphasis added)." Id . 
The reasons for giving little weight to the opinion of the treating physician must be supported by substantial evidence, Marbury v. Sullivan, 957 F.2d 837 , 841 (11th Cir. 1992), and must be clearly articulated. Phillips, 357 F.3d at 1241 . "The Secretary must specify what weight is given to a treating physician's opinion and any reason for giving it no weight, and failure to do so is reversible error." MacGregor, 786 F.2d at 1053 .
The ALJ may discount a treating physician's opinion report regarding an inability to work if it is unsupported by objective medical evidence and is wholly conclusory. Edwards v. Sullivan, 937 F.2d 580 , 583-84 (11th Cir. 1991). Stated somewhat differently, the ALJ may discount the treating physician's opinion if good cause exists to do so. Hillsman v. Bowen, 804 F. 2d 1179 , 1181 (11th Cir. 1986). Good cause may be found when the opinion is "not bolstered by the evidence," the evidence "[*5] supports a contrary finding," the opinion is "conclusory" or "so brief and conclusory that it lacks persuasive weight," the opinion is "inconsistent with [the treating physician's own medical records," the statement "contains no [supporting] clinical data or information," the opinion "is unsubstantiated by any clinical or laboratory findings," or the opinion "is not accompanied by objective medical evidence." Lewis, 125 F.3d at 1440 ; Edwards, 937 F.2d at 583 (citing Schnorr v. Bowen, 816 F.2d 578 , 582 (11th Cir. 1987)). Further, where a treating physician has merely made conclusory statements, the ALJ may afford them such weight to the extent they are supported by clinical or laboratory findings and are consistent with other evidence as to a claimant's impairments. Wheeler v. Heckler, 784 F.2d 1073 , 1075 (11th Cir. 1986).
IV. The Evidence 
A. Relevant Medical Evidence 
Plaintiff's alleged onset of disability is January 26, 2012. Prior to her onset date, she received treatment from March 2010 through August 2010 from Dr. John Hoehn, a chiropractor, for left and right neck stiffness. Tr. 267-70, 285-86; see Tr. 32. Plaintiff was seen monthly for neck stiffness and pain and stiffness in both sides of her upper and lower back. Examination revealed spasm and tenderness over the lower cervical region, palpation of the thoracic spine indicates spasm and tenderness over the middle and lower region, and spasm and tenderness over the entire lumbar spine. Also in 2010, she received treatment from Sujata Wagh, M.D., for diabetes mellitus. Tr. 307-09; see Tr. 32. She reported having severe hypoglycemic episodes at work.

Dr. Wagh treated Plaintiff from March 2012 through September 2012. Tr. 289-96, 408-18; see Tr. 33. On March 22, 2012, her hemoglobin A1C was elevated. Tr. 293-96. She reported morning hypoglycemia, but did not want to transition to the pump. Id. Muscle pain is noted under review of systems/musculoskeletal. Tr. 294. Under physical exam, Dr. Wagh noted the same findings under musculoskeletal, as she did on December 15, 2011, Tr. 299, but added: "Distal extremities reveal - nails are thickened, discolored, or disfigured - consistent with onychomycosis (Great toes only)."
On April 12, 2012, her blood work showed a low thyroid stimulating hormone value. Tr. 289-92. Plaintiff underwent a neck ultrasound that showed thyroid pseudonodules. She was diagnosed with Graves Disease and uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. She was prescribed Methimazole [*8] and was told to reduce her Lantus dose due to late afternoon hypoglycemic. Plaintiff did not want to transition to the insulin pump due to afternoon hypoglycemia. Id. Under review of systems and musculoskeletal, back pain was reported for the first time to Dr. Wagh. Tr. 290. Within the physical examination portion of the notes and under the musculoskeletal exam heading, it was noted that there is was evidence of proximal muscle weakness; motor strength was 5/5 in the upper and lower extremities; gait and station were normal; and the spine was nontender to palpation. Nails were discolored. Tr. 291; see Tr. 33.
On June 20, 2012, her recent blood work was reviewed and her medications were adjusted. Tr. 415-18. Her late afternoon hypoglycemia had improved. Dr. Wagh noted that Plaintiff was not interested in an insulin pump. She exercised by working in her yard; she did not do aerobic exercises. She was restarted on Pravastatin. Tr. 415.

On January 7, 2013, Plaintiff was examined by Dr. Reddy. Tr. 454-56. The results of the physical examination were the same as reported on September 11, 2012. See, e.g., Tr. 228-32, 237-40, 247, 360-63, 424-26, 443-44, 446-52, 457-61, 463-64, 495, 504-05.
On February 18, 2013, she was examined by Dr. Reddy and reported continued neck and shoulder pain. Tr. 457-59; see Tr. 34. This time, she underwent Botox injections into the bilateral upper trapezius, left splenius cervical, bilateral upper thoracic and rhomboids, left levator scapulae, bilateral splenius, and cervical paravertebrals. Plaintiff was prescribed Tramadol and started on Robaxin for cervical spasms. [*10] Id. The results of the physical examination were the same as prior examination results.
On April 8, 2013, Plaintiff was examined by Dr. Reddy and continued to have right sided neck and shoulder pain. Tr. 424-26, 460-62. She only had temporary relief with trigger point injections and Botox injections and was referred to Dr. Scott for a neurosurgical evaluation. Id. Physical examination results were the same as prior results.
Plaintiff also continued to receive chiropractic treatment from Dr. Hoehn from November 2012 through February 2013. Tr. 427-40. On February 4, 2013, Dr. Hoehn's plan included Plaintiff continuing isometric stretching and strengthening programs to increase ROM and build core muscle stability and continue NMMT for pain/spasm in areas of complaints. Tr. 440.
Progress notes dated June 12, 2013, revealed additional care by Dr. Wagh. Tr. 397-401. Plaintiff had worsening A1C values (8.4) and again was advised to have insulin pump, but wanted to wait another six months. She was continued on Lantus, Humalog, and Methimazole for hyperthyroidism. It is noted that Plaintiff "just had neck surgery for cervical fusion. She denies polyuria, nocturnal/tingling numbness in her feet. She o/w feels well, no complaints." Plaintiff reported experiencing hypoglycemia almost daily and in the daytime related to yard work. Tr. 397. Neck and back pain were noted. It is again noted that Plaintiff exercises regularly and appropriately for her age and health, predominantly swimming. Tr. 398.
On July 29, 2013, Plaintiff was examined by Dr. Reddy and complained of pain located in the back of her skull and pain in her neck and low back. The intensity was 2-3/10. Tr. 463; see Tr. 34. The results of the physical examination were the same as prior results. Tr. 463-64; Compare with Tr. 228-32, 237-40, 247, 360-63, 424-26, 443-44, 446-52, 457-61, 495, 504-05. The plan included the following: "patient is S/P cervical a CDF with radicular arm pain resolved - will recommend patient follow up with [Dr.] Eric Scott - continue tramadol and robaxin for cervical spasms and pain." Tr. 465. (This is the last page of the record that was before the ALJ.)
On October 23, 2013, (per Exhibit List), Dr. Reddy completed a medical source statement regarding Plaintiff.7 Tr. 422-23. Plaintiff could lift and carry ten pounds occasionally and five pounds frequently and could sit for two hours total and stand and walk for one hour during an eight hour workday. Tr. 422. She could sit at onetime for an hour and stand or walk for one hour before needing to get up and move around. Plaintiff needed to alternate sitting and standing (every hour) to relieve pain or discomfort and she should avoid dust, fumes, gases, extremes of temperature, humidity, and other environmental pollutants. She could never work with hazardous machinery and could rarely climb, balance, bend, or stoop. Plaintiff could occasionally engage in gross and fine manipulation, in reaching, pulling/ pushing (arm and/or leg controls), and operating a motor vehicle. Id. Plaintiff would likely be absent from work two days per month as a result of her impairments due to cervical brachial [*11] pain, cervical radicular pain, lumbar radiculopathy and status post cervical fusion. Tr. 423. These restrictions applied as of September 12, 2013. Id. 
On November 20, 2013, Dr. Reddy examined Plaintiff who complained of current pain in between the right side and pain in the "right wrist/SI."8 Tr. 441. Plaintiff reported no new pain complaints since the last visit. Id. Her pain intensity was 3.5/10. Id. From a neurological standpoint, Plaintiff reported "[w]eakness of arms or legs, right arm. Trouble using your hands. (right)." Id. Plaintiff denied loss of consciousness and balance, trouble walking, and numbness of arms or legs. Id. Dr. Reddy performed a physical examination that included the musculoskeletal system. Tr. 443. Regarding the cervical spine, inspection and palpation revealed: "cervical ROM full, cervical spinous processes nontender, cervical facet joints nontender, no cervical muscle spasm." Id. Regarding the thoracic spine and range of motion, it is noted: "thoracic kyphosis normal, no thoracic facet joint tenderness, thoracic TrP palpated, TrP rhomboids, right rhomboid major." Id.

Tr. 444. A care plan included home exercise program. Topical analgesic was reordered, disability forms were faxed, and massage therapy recommended. Id. 
B. Medical evidence submitted to the Appeals Council.
1. Introduction 
Exhibits 1A through 14F were presented to the ALJ. Tr. 39-42. Exhibit 14F (pages 1-25) ends at page 465 and thereafter the pages are numbered consecutively starting on page 22 of 72 to page 72 of 72. See Tr. 466-516. It appears that Exhibit 15F (Tr. [*12] 466-83), Exhibit 16F (Tr. 484-491), Exhibit 17F (Tr. 492), and Exhibit 18F (Tr. 493-516) were provided to the Appeals Council after the ALJ rendered his decision. The Appeals Council referred to Exhibits 17F and 18F, which appear in the record at pages 492-516, but not to Exhibits 15F and 16F.9 
Tr. 5.
During the hearing, the ALJ stated that he was aware that Plaintiff had a cervical fusion. Tr. 56. Plaintiff's counsel responded that they "were trying to get records from a Dr. Eric Scott, who did a cervical fusion on her back in April. And we just paid for them, although we've been requesting them since September. So I'm not sure what's taking so long. So I apologize. I'm going to have her testify about the treating with Dr. Scott." Id. Plaintiff described her treatment leading up to her examination and ultimate surgery with Dr. Scott. Tr. 56-59. Plaintiff testified that the cervical fusion resolved her symptoms for a few months and "[i]t was very nice." Tr. 59-60. Plaintiff returned to Dr. Reddy because the pain in her muscles returned. Tr. 60. Dr. Reddy "explained [to her] that the arthritis in [her] neck was still there and they couldn't get rid of that. That this would continue to happen." Id. Plaintiff stated that the symptoms she experienced related to her neck were "[j]ust the pain in [her] back." Id. The pain was not as bad as it was prior to surgery, but "it's there," from her neck and shoulder into her arm and into her index finger joint on her right hand. Id. She described additional problems she was having. Tr. 61-62.
After the VE testified and before the hearing ended, the transcript does not indicate that Plaintiff's counsel requested the ALJ to keep the record open pending receipt of the missing medical records, including the cervical fusion operative report and other patient records from Dr. Scott and the results of a scheduled test (nerve conduction study).10 Tr. 35-36. On June 18, 2014, the Appeals Council granted Plaintiff's counsel's request for an extension of time, Tr. 21-23, 221-24, to submit additional evidence. Tr. 7, 14; see  supra at 2-3 and n.1.
In his decision, the ALJ stated that Plaintiff testified that she underwent a cervical fusion by Dr. Scott in April 2013, "yet the claimant did not provide an operative report and a June 2013 record makes no mention of a cervical fusion. (Exhibit 11F/1-04 [Tr. 397-400 (Dr. Wagh's patient notes of June 12, 2013)]." Tr. 35. The ALJ was partially mistaken. Dr. Wagh noted in the same patient record of June 12, 2013, that Plaintiff "just had neck surgery for cervical fusion." Tr. 397. No operative report was provided to the ALJ.
2. The post-ALJ decision evidence.
Notwithstanding, the following is a summary of the evidence that appears in the record after the ALJ rendered his decision.
An EMG/NCV study was performed in September 2012 that showed evidence of borderline carpal tunnel syndrome which was asymptomatic at that time. Tr. 480-81.
Although Dr. Scott, her treating neurosurgeon, is referred to in patient records that were before the ALJ, Dr. Eric Scott's patient records were not obtained until after the ALJ denied Plaintiff disability benefits. See  supra at 2-3 and n.1.
Dr. Scott treated Plaintiff [*13] from April 12, 2013, through May 30, 2014. Tr. 469-79, 492. On April 12, 2013, Plaintiff reported pain in the back of the right cervical region that radiated under the shoulder down the triceps and finger tips of her right hand. Examination revealed trace weakness of the right triceps with some applicable atrophy in the right triceps. Her MRI of the cervical spine was reviewed. Plaintiff was noted to have focal advanced degenerative changes at C5-6 and mild to moderate at C6-7. She also had severe hypertrophy of the uncovertebral joints bilaterally at C5-6. She was diagnosed with right cervical brachial pain and radiculopathy secondary to osteophyte complexes at C5/6 and C6/7, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism and tobacco abuse. He recommended that she undergo surgical intervention since she had failed conservative treatment. Id. 
The surgical notes dated April 16, 2013, reveal Dr. Scott's rationale for the surgery. She was noted to have MRI findings that demonstrated severe foraminal narrowing due to spondylostenosis at C5-6 and a disk protrusion to the right at C5-C6-C7. Tr. 475. The surgical findings confirmed severe spondylostenosis at C5-6, moderate at C6-7. There was also severe foraminal narrowing on the right at C5-6 and foraminal extrusion to the right of C6-7. She underwent a cervical discectomy and microsurgical decompression of the spinal cord and roots at C5-6, C6-7, anterior cervical arthrodesis at C5-6, C6-7 using perk cages novabone and bone marrow aspirate and anterior cervical instrumentation. Id. 
On April 24, 2013, her staples were removed. Tr. 474. She was fitted with a bone growth stimulator and instructed on its use and was told to continue to wear her hard collar. Id. On June 10, 2013, she presented for a cervical fusion routine follow-up with Dr. Scott, several months after cervical surgery on April 16, 2013. Plaintiff stated that "she is doing very well. She is pain free." Her incision was "very well healed. Her upper extremity strength is intact. She does continue to wear her bone growth stimulator." Tr. 473. She was advised to wear the bone growth stimulator for at least six more months. Id. In a separate report date June 10, 2013, the radiologist noted, in part, "[f]lexion is limited with a slight anterior subluxation of C4 upon C5 measuring about 2 mm in flexion and reduced in extension. That C4-5 disc space is slightly narrowed anteriorly. No other abnormality is apparent." The radiologist's impression was status post anterior cervical spinal fusion (ACDF) C5-C7 and "[m]inimal degenerative change and abnormal motion at C4-5." Tr. 472.
Dr. Scott reexamined Plaintiff on September 4, 2013, post-cervical fusion. Tr. 471. "She is doing very well. Her only symptoms are some hand numbness, especially at nighttime." Id. She was advised to wear the bone stimulator for an additional four months. They discussed "possible carpal tunnel syndrome and possible work-up and treatment of this, however, she does not wish to pursue this at this time." Id. 
On January 10, 2014, Dr. Scott noted that Plaintiff was doing well from her ACDF, but continued [*14] to have some discomfort in the trapezius. Dr. Reddy had prescribed a compound ointment, which Plaintiff rubbed in and was helpful. Tr. 469. Plaintiff noticed a problem with pain in her right hand and difficulty using a computer mouse. As noted, she still had some trapezius discomfort and was referred to Dr. Reddy for further testing (EMG/nerve conduction study for suspected carpel tunnel syndrome).11 Id. 
Dr. Wagh treated Plaintiff for diabetes mellitus on March 12, 2014. Tr. 484. Her hemoglobin A1C was elevated at 8.1. She diagnosed Plaintiff with diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia and hyperthyroidism and was continued on her medication. Id. It is again noted that Plaintiff exercises regularly and appropriately for her age and health, predominantly swimming. Tr. 485. Neck, back, joint, and muscle pain and muscle weakness are noted. Id. 
Plaintiff was examined by Dr. Reddy on April 3, 2014. Tr. 493-98. Plaintiff complained of current pain in her hand, forearms, and sciatica in both legs. Her current pain intensity was described as 5/10. Tr. 493. Plaintiff denied back and muscle pain and persistent pain in her joints. Tr. 494. The results of Dr. Reddy's physical examination, which included musculoskeletal and neurological aspects, were similar to prior physical examination results, Tr. 495-96. Compare with Tr. 228-32, 237-40, 247, 360-63, 424-26, 443-44, 446-52, 454-55, 457-61, 463-64, 504-05.
Additionally, after the ALJ issued his decision, see  supra at 34 n.11, Plaintiff underwent an MRI of the lumbar spine performed on April 4, 2014. Tr. 492, 500-01.12 The findings in the MRI report stated: "The height of the vertebral bodies are normal. There is marked disc space narrowing at L4-5 with a mixture of modic one, two, three changes. There is no spondylolisthesis." Tr. 500. The impression was "[a]dvanced L4-5 degeneration with mild L4 retrospondylolisthesis of L4 and moderate narrowing of right L4-5 foramen." Id. Plaintiff was referred for a L4 transforaminal epidural steroid injection. Id. 
On May 1, 2014, Dr. Reddy examined Plaintiff who complained of current pain in the lower extremities and described it as "aching," with the current reported pain intensity of 5/10. Tr. 503. The patient notes under the objective portion of the examination, including musculoskeletal, extremities, neurological, and psychiatric were similar to prior reports. Tr. 504-05; see Tr. 228-32, 237-40, 247, 360-63, 424-26, 443-44, 446-52, 454-55, 457-61, 463-64, 495-96. Plaintiff was prescribed Norco. Tr. 505. A home exercise program was included in the care plan. Id. A referral to Dr. Scott was recommended for surgical opinion. Continued management and massage therapy with Dr. Hoehn for chiropractic management was noted. Topical compound analgesic was ordered for hand pain and CTS symptoms and Zanaflex was recommended for muscle spasms. Lortab was refilled, which Plaintiff used occasionally limited to severe "IBP only." Tr. 506.
On May 30, 2014, Plaintiff saw Dr. Scott. Tr. 492. Dr. Scott noted that it was more than a year out from her "ACDF" and she reported that her symptoms were fairly stable from that standpoint. Dr. Scott noted that when he saw Plaintiff [*15] in January 2014 she was having some problems with her right hand while using a computer mouse. An EMG/nerve conduction study was suggested and later performed.13 Dr. Reddy reported that the study showed carpal tunnel syndrome and Dr. Scott requested the results. Id. It is also noted that Plaintiff had problems with back pain, right buttock, and leg pain. The EMG/nerve conduction study of the lower extremities was normal as per a report of May 1, 2014. Id. Dr. Scott provided his assessment of the April 4, 2014, MRI. Dr. Scott's impression included post laminectomy syndrome with right L4-5 stenosis and status post left L4-5 discectomy. Dr. Scott noted that Dr. Valentine would be requested to perform a right L4 transforaminal ESI. Id. 
On June 5, 2014, Dr. Valentine treated Plaintiff. Tr. 510-16. Plaintiff presented with low back and right leg pain and described it as aching and throbbing. The intensity was 7/10. Tr. 510. Under cerebellum, it is noted: "The gait is normal the patient can walk several steps, then turn, and come back; balance is easy, the arms swing at the sides, and turns are accomplished smoothly." Plaintiff was oriented; thought processes were coherent and insight good. No pain behaviors were noted. Tr. 511. She was diagnosed with right L4-5 foramina stenosis with neurogenic claudication, thoracic/lumbosacral neuritis (unspecified) and lumbar spinal stenosis. Plaintiff received a lumbar transforaminal epidural injection at L4. Id. 
V. Legal Analysis 
Plaintiff argues that the Commissioner's decision to deny her benefits should be reversed because the ALJ's rejection of the opinion of treating physician, Dr. Reddy, is not supported by substantial evidence and that the Appeals Council erred in not remanding the case to the ALJ for evaluation of Plaintiff's treating neurosurgeon's (Dr. Scott) patient records that preand post-date the ALJ's decision. ECF No. 12 at 1, 13-24.
The ALJ provided a skillful analysis of the relevant facts presented in this record and particularly when he determined whether Plaintiff's impairments were severe or non-severe at step two and when he assessed Plaintiff's RFC. Tr. 29-37.
Plaintiff performed past work as a state trooper. During her employment and, thereafter, Plaintiff was examined and treated by a host of healthcare providers for a myriad of health related issues, including those found to be severe such as degenerative disc disease of the cervical spine and lumbar disc displacement, Tr. 29, as well as other impairments that were rated as non-severe such as diabetes and hyperglycemia, Graves disease, thyroid disorder, problems with her left elbow and bursitis, allergies and urinary incontinence, and depression. Tr. 30-31.
The ALJ discusses her examination and treatment from 2010 through 2013, which included noting conflicting reports by Plaintiff to some of the healthcare providers. Tr. 32-36. For example, the ALJ noted that records from August to September 2011 revealed that Plaintiff sought treatment for a few years for low back and neck pain. Tr. 32. Dr. Wagh treated Plaintiff for diabetes-related problems [*16] for several years (2010-2013). Other healthcare providers, including Drs. Valentine and Reddy and Dr. Hoehn (a chiropractor), routinely treated Plaintiff for neck, back, and muscle pain. Tr. 32-36. The ALJ makes much of comparing Dr. Wagh's patient notes with the other patient notes as those latter notes record Plaintiff's report of muscle, back, and neck pain and Dr. Wagh's patient notes do not include the same "level of symptoms." Tr. 32-33. Further, the ALJ notes that Dr. Wagh's records from March to September 2012, stated that Plaintiff "reported intermittent 'muscle pain,' 'back pain,' and 'neck pain,'" and that "[t]he treatment records were dedicated chiefly to discussing the claimant's diabetes and hyperthyroidism." Tr. 33. The ALJ continued:
Dr. Wagh provided no details about the claimant's musculoskeletal complaints. The claimant reported that despite her muscle pain she swims for exercise and works in the yard. The claimant reported that she had "retired" from her job. Dr. Wagh noted completely normal physical and musculoskeletal examinations. Dr. Wagh did not diagnose the claimant with the musculoskeletal impairment or recommend any treatment for her muscle pain. Pain medications were not listed among her medications. (Exhibit 5F/04-09, 11F).
On November 07, 2012, the claimant sought evaluation with chiropractor J. Hoehn, DC. The claimant had been seeking intermittent chiropractic manipulation from Dr. Hoehn since 2010. (Exhibit 4F). The claimant reported a wide range of musculoskeletal symptoms (pain, stiffness, muscle spasms) throughout her shoulders, wrists, scapula, low back, mid back, upper back, neck, and head. Claimant described the symptoms as a 7 out of 10, increased by sitting, lifting, time on the computer, and bending. The undersigned wonders why the claimant did not report this level of symptoms to Dr. Wagh, who examined the claimant just a few months prior [on June 20, 2012, Tr. 416; Sept. 12, 2012, Tr. 409].
Dr. Hoehn noted malposition, hypertonicity, trigger points, and tenderness. The undersigned notes that Dr. Hoehn's clinical findings are highly inconsistent with the normal musculoskeletal findings noted by Dr. Wagh just a few months prior. Dr. Hoehn diagnosed cervicalgia, thorcalgia, lumbago, muscle spasms, myalgia/myositis, and headaches. Dr. Hoehn recommended chiropractic manipulation and home stretching. (Exhibit 13F). The claimant reported improvement with treatment, such that by January and February 2013 pain was down to 4-5/10 from a high of 7/10. (Exhibit 13F/12.).
Tr. 33-34 (emphasis added). (Earlier in his decision, the ALJ expressed his wonder "why the claimant did not mention back pain to Dr. Wagh" after receiving treatment for a few years for low back and neck pain. Tr. 32. Some patient notes from Drs. Valentine and Reddy were sent to Drs. Wagh, Hoehn, and Ashley. See, e.g., Tr. 447, 452-53.) The ALJ continued to discuss records from 2013 that did "not reveal any objective worsening in the claimant symptoms." Tr. 34. The ALJ then explained that his RFC assessment and restriction to light work in light of a May 2, 2011, x-ray of Plaintiff's cervical spine, a 2012 MRI of Plaintiff'[*17] s cervical spine, the 2011-2013 clinical findings of Drs. Valentine and Reddy, similar clinical findings by Dr. Hoehn, other medical findings, Tr. 34, and Plaintiff's "activities of daily living." Tr. 34-35. The ALJ then discussed several credibility factors that were adverse to Plaintiff. Id. 

Next, and relevant to Plaintiff's second argument, the ALJ discussed Plaintiff's cervical fusion.
The claimant testified that she underwent a cervical fusion performed by Dr. Scott in April 2013 yet the claimant did not provide an operative report and a June 2013 record makes no mention of a cervical fusion. (Exhibit 11F/1-04). The claimant reported that she received very good relief from the symptoms for a few months, but that the symptoms then improved. Dr. Reddy did not note in his November 2013 record that the claimant underwent a cervical fusion in April 2013. (Exhibit 14 F/04). Even if the claimant did, it must have helped her symptoms because the claimant reported improvement, such that she was exercising regularly doing yard work. (Exhibit 11F/01).
Tr. 35 (emphasis added). Exhibit 11F/01 refers to Dr. Wagh's patient note of June 12, 2013, in which Plaintiff stated that "[s]he just had neck surgery for cervical fusion." Tr. 397. Dr. Wagh noted that Plaintiff worked in her yard, did no aerobic exercise, and reported that her hypoglycemia was almost daily in the daytime. Id. At this time, Dr. Wagh also noted that Plaintiff "exercises fairly regularly and appropriately for age and health, predominantly swimming." Tr. 398. A review of systems indicated, in part, that Plaintiff had neck and back pain. Id. (Plaintiff first reported muscle, neck, and back pain to Dr. Wagh on June 20, 2012, Tr. 416, having mentioned back pain on April 12, 2012, Tr. 290.) The ALJ continued to compare Plaintiff's testimony and her daily activities with what she told her healthcare providers, concluding that there were inconsistencies. Tr. 35-36. The ALJ also declined to wait for the results of the reported nerve conduction study, see  supra at 36 n.13, "[g]iven the very significant lack of upper extremity objective findings." Tr. 36.

Having previously discussed relevant excerpts from Dr. Reddy's patient notes, the ALJ rejected the opinion rendered by Dr. Reddy in his medical source statement of October 2013 that Plaintiff's limitations were "consistent with a very restricted range of sedentary work." Tr. 36. The ALJ gave "very limited weight" to this opinion, assuming it "was completed by Dr. Reddy and no weight if it was completed by a non-acceptable medical source." Id. As noted herein, see  supra at 25 n.7, the ALJ assumed the medical source statement was completed by Dr. Reddy. Tr. 36.
Plaintiff bears the burden of proving that she is disabled, and consequently, is responsible for producing evidence in support of her claim. See 20 C.F.R. § 404.1512(a) ; Moore v. Barnhart, 405 F.3d at 1211 . On the other hand, an ALJ has a clear duty to fully and fairly develop the administrative record. Brown v. Shalala, 44 F.3d 931 , 934 (11th Cir. 1995); 20 C.F.R. § 404.1512(d) . See Rosa v. Callahan, 168 F.3d 72 , 79 (2d Cir. 1999) ("One of our recent opinions confirms, moreover, that an ALJ cannot reject a treating physician's diagnosis without first attempting [*18] to fill any clear gaps in the administrative record.") (citing Schaal v. Apfel, 134 F.3d 496 , 505 (2d Cir. 1998) ("[E]ven if the clinical findings were inadequate, it was the ALJ's duty to seek additional information from [the treating physician] sua sponte.")); 20 C.F.R. § 404.1520b . Further, under Social Security Ruling 96-5p, 1996 SSR LEXIS 2 , at *6 (July 2, 1996), the ALJ must make "every reasonable effort" to re-contact a medical source when the medical evidence does not support the source's opinion, and the ALJ cannot ascertain the basis for that opinion from the case record. Vesy v. Astrue, 353 F. App'x 219 , 225 (11th Cir. 2009) (unpublished). The question here is whether there are "the kinds of gaps in the evidence necessary to demonstrate prejudice" to Plaintiff. Graham v. Apfel, 129 F.3d 1420 , 1423 (11th Cir. 1997).
Plaintiff does not expressly argue that the ALJ decided the case on an inadequate record. ECF No. 12 at 1, 13-24. Yet, this is an essential part of Plaintiff's claim of error. Plaintiff called into question the ALJ's failure to acknowledge that Plaintiff had a cervical fusion in April 2013 and further stated that Plaintiff's counsel told the ALJ at the hearing that she had been trying to get the records from Dr. Scott for five months. Tr. 56; ECF No. 12 at 18-23. Plaintiff argues that the ALJ made a rush to judgment when evaluating and giving "very limited weight" to the opinion of Dr. Reddy, a treating physician, and "very significant weight" to the July 17, 2012, opinion of Dr. Bancks, a non-examining reviewer, without obtaining relevant patient records. Id.; see Tr. 36-37. The Court agrees, although Plaintiff's counsel could have helped the situation by expressly asking the ALJ to extend the time for closing the record.14 On the other hand, the ALJ should have offered to keep the record open for a time certain, see, e.g.,  supra at 30 n.10, knowing that relevant patient records would likely be forthcoming.15 The failure to fully and fairly develop the record, especially in light of the ALJ's characterization of the existing and missing records, was prejudicial to Plaintiff, see Graham v. Apfel, 129 F.3d at 1423 , and requires a remand for the purpose of requiring the ALJ to review all of the patient records, including Exhibits 15F through 18F, Tr. 466-516, in conjunction with existing records and to reconsider Plaintiff's claim of disability. See generally Cary v. Colvin, Case No. 8:15-CV-462-T-MAP, [2016 BL 75502], 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31618 , at *8-9 (M.D., Fla. Mar. 11, 2016). Further, the ALJ should be directed to consider whether he should re-contact one or more of Plaintiff's treating physicians and whether Plaintiff should be referred for an independent physical examination. See Salazar v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec., 372 F. App'x 64 , 67 (11th Cir. 2010) (unpublished) (citing 20 C.F.R. § 404.1517 ). But the ALJ "is not required to order additional examinations if the evidence in the record is sufficient to allow him to make an informed decision." Id . (citing Ingram v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec., 496 F.3d 1253 , 1269 (11th Cir. 2007)). The Court makes no determination whether Plaintiff is disabled.
VI. Conclusion 
Considering the record as a whole, the findings of the Administrative Law Judge are not based upon substantial evidence in the record and he did not correctly follow the law. Accordingly, it is respectfully RECOMMENDED that the decision of [*19] the Commissioner to deny Plaintiff's application for Social Security benefits be REVERSED pursuant to sentence four of 42 U.S.C. § 405(g) and REMANDED for further proceedings.

At the time of his decision, the ALJ had before him Exhibits 1A through 14F. See Tr. 39-42; see also Tr. 31, 34-35 (references to Exhibit 14F). (At the hearing, without objection, the ALJ admitted Exhibits 1A through 13F into evidence. Tr. 47.) Exhibits 15F and 16F pre-date the ALJ's decision, whereas Exhibits 17F and 18F postdate the ALJ's decision.

"Semi-skilled work is work which needs some skills but does not require doing the more complex work duties. Semi[skilled jobs may require alertness and close attention to watching machine processes; or inspecting, testing or otherwise looking for irregularities; or tending or guarding equipment, property, materials, or persons against loss, damage or injury; or other types of activities which are similarly less complex than skilled work, but more complex than unskilled work. A job may be classified as semiskilled where coordination and dexterity are necessary, as when hands or feet must be moved quickly to do repetitive tasks." 20 C.F.R. § 404.1568(b) . An SVP of 3 means "[o]ver 1 month up to and including 3 months." Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT) (4th Ed., Rev. 1991), Appendix C: Components of the Definition Trailer, § II, SVP. In part, "[l]ight work involves lifting no more than 20 pounds at a time with frequent lifting or carrying objects weighing up to 10 pounds. . . If someone can do light work, we determine that he or she can also do sedentary work, unless there are additional limiting factors such as loss of fine dexterity or inability to sit for long periods of time" 20 C.F.R. § 404.1567(b) .

"If the Commissioner's decision is supported by substantial evidence we must affirm, even if the proof preponderates against it." Phillips v. Barnhart, 357 F.3d 1232 , 1240 n.8 (11th Cir. 2004) (citations omitted). "A 'substantial evidence' standard, however, does not permit a court to uphold the Secretary's decision by referring only to those parts of the record which support the ALJ. A reviewing court must view the entire record and take account of evidence in the record which detracts from the evidence relied on by the ALJ." Tieniber v. Heckler, 720 F.2d 1251 , 1253 (11th Cir. 1983). "Unless the Secretary has analyzed all evidence and has sufficiently explained the weight he has given to obviously probative exhibits, to say that his decision is supported by substantial evidence approaches an abdication of the court's 'duty to scrutinize the record as a whole to determine whether the conclusions reached are rational.'" Cowart v. Schweiker, 662 F.2d 731 , 735 (11th Cir. 1981) (citations omitted).

An RFC is the most a claimant can still do despite limitations. 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.1520(e) , 404.1545(a)(1) , (a)(3) . It is an assessment based upon all of the relevant evidence including the claimant's description of her limitations, observations by treating and examining physicians or other persons, and medical records. Id . The responsibility for determining claimant's RFC lies with the ALJ. 20 C.F.R. § 404.1546(c) ; see SSR (SSR) 96-5p, 1996 SSR LEXIS 2 , at *12 (July 2, 1996) ("The term "residual functional capacity assessment" describes an adjudicator's finding about the ability of an individual to perform work-related activities. The assessment is based upon consideration of all relevant evidence in the case record, including medical evidence and relevant nonmedical evidence, such as observations of lay witnesses of an individual's apparent symptomatology, an individual's own statement of what he or she is able or unable to do, and many other factors that could help the adjudicator determine the most reasonable findings in light of all the evidence.").

Similar physical examination findings are reported by Drs. Valentine and Reddy in other patient notes. See, e.g., Tr. 237-40, 247, 360-63, 424-26, 443-44, 446-52, 457-61, 463-64, 495, 504-05.

On July 17, 2012, Nicolas Bancks, M.D., a non-examining, State agency consultant, provided an RFC assessment as part of a reconsideration review. Tr. 389-93. Dr. Bancks reviewed patient records from August 2011 through May 2012. Tr. 390-91. He determined that Plaintiff could perform light work with restrictions. Tr. 390-93.

As noted by the ALJ, the physician signature is not legible. Tr. 36, 423. The ALJ assumed it was Dr. Reddy. Id. The ALJ reasoned that the signature was Dr. Reddy's because on November 20, 2013, Dr. Reddy noted, as part of the plan, "disability forms faxed." Tr. 36, 444.

The other document mentioned by Plaintiff in her post-hearing memorandum is from Dr. Reddy dated February 19, 2014, which does not appear in the record, id., although Dr. Reddy noted on April 3, 2014, "Carpel Tunnel Syndrome (disorder) (Onset: 02/19/2014 — Active." Tr. 497. During the hearing, Plaintiff mentioned having a nerve conduction test re-scheduled for February 19, 2014, ordered by Dr. Scott. Tr. 63-66. The ALJ mentioned this test, but declined to wait for the study "as it is highly unlikely to have any impact on the claimant's [RFC]." Tr. 36; see infra at 36-37 n.13.

WILLIAM MATTHEWMAN 
ORDER GRANTING GOVERNMENT'S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF ORDER DENYING PRETRIAL DETENTION AS TO DEFENDANT ROGELIO RAMOS AND PRETRIAL DETENTION ORDER
THIS MATTER is before the Court upon the Government's Motion For Reconsideration of Order Denying Government's Motion For Pretrial Detention [DE 37] [hereinafter the "Reconsideration Motion"]. The Government initially moved for pre-trial detention of Defendant Rogelio Ramos on the basis of a substantial or serious risk of flight or nonappearance and danger to the community. The Court held a detention hearing on March 21, 2014.1 At the conclusion of the detention hearing, the Court orally announced that it was denying the Government's motion for pretrial detention as to Defendant Rogelio Ramos. The Court set a $200,000 personal surety bond to be co-signed by the Defendant's wife, a $25,000 corporate surety bond with a Nebbia requirement, home confinement with electronic monitoring, and numerous other stringent conditions of release. The Court subsequently entered a written Order Denying Government's Motion For Pretrial Detention as to Defendant Rogelio Ramos [DE 24] to further explain its rationale for denying pretrial detention.
Thereafter, two things happened. First, the Defendant was unable to obtain the prosecutor's agreement as to satisfaction of the Nebbia requirement. Second, the Government filed its Reconsideration Motion [DE 37]. The Court therefore set the matter down for hearing on April 1, 2014 on both the Nebbia issue and the Government's Reconsideration Motion.2 A hearing was held on April 1, 2014 and at the conclusion of that hearing, the Court took the matter under advisement and re-set the matter to April 4, 2014 to announce its decision. At the April 4, [*2] 2014 hearing, the Court announced that it was granting the Government's Motion for Reconsideration and, in light of the new, material information and evidence submitted by the Government, was entering an Order granting the Government's request for pretrial detention as to Defendant Rogelio Ramos. This written Order follows.
I. Legal Standard 
The policy underlying the Bail Reform Act "is to permit release under the least restrictive condition compatible with assuring the future appearance of the defendant." United States v. Price, 773 F.2d 1526 , 1527 (11th Cir. 1985) (per curiam). When the United States seeks to detain a criminal defendant pending trial based on his status as a flight risk, it must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that no condition or set of conditions will reasonably assure his presence at trial. United States v. Medina, 775 F.2d 1398 , 1402 (11th Cir. 1985). By contrast, where the Government seeks to detain a defendant based on a contention that he is a danger to the community, it must show by clear and convincing evidence that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the safety of the community. Id. However, where, like here, a defendant is charged with an offense for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed in the Controlled Substances Act, a rebuttable presumption arises that the person is both a flight risk and a danger to the community. "Once the statutory presumptions are raised, the defendant carries the burden of production to come forward with evidence to rebut the presumptions." United States v. Quartermaine, 913 F.2d 910 , 916 (11th Cir. 1990). But this "obligation to come forward with evidence does not shift to the defendant the government's burden of persuasion." Id. (citing United States v. King, 849 F.2d 485 , 488 (11th Cir. 1988)). Accordingly, in a presumption case, the defendant bears the burden of producing evidence to suggest that he is not dangerous and/or that he is not likely to flee if released. Quartermaine, 913 F.2d at 916 (quoting United States v. Hurtado, 779 F.2d 1467 , 1479 (11th Cir. 1985)). In presumption cases, "the presumption becomes evidence to be considered along with other evidence listed in the [Bail Reform] Act as indicative of risk of flight or danger to the community." Quartermaine, 913 F.2d at 916 . Finally, the presumption of detention does not alter the defendant's underlying presumption of innocence. See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(j) .
As to the Government's Reconsideration Motion, the last sentence of 18 U.S.C. 3142(f) states as follows:
The hearing may be reopened, before or after a determination by the judicial officer, at any time before trial if the judicial officer finds that information exists that was not known to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the appearance of such person as required and the safety of any other person and the community.
Accordingly, on a reconsideration motion, the Government is required to establish that a) information exists that was not known to the Government at the time of the initial detention hearing and b) that such information has a material [*3] bearing on the issue of whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the appearance of such person as required and the safety of any other person and the community. Following the dictates of this statute, the Court has carefully considered the information, proffer, and argument presented by the Government in support of its Reconsideration Motion at the April 1, 2014 hearing, as well as Defendant's proffer and argument in opposition.

II. Discussion 
In its Reconsideration Motion [DE 37] and at the April 1, 2014 hearing, the Government advanced the following alleged new and material information:
A. Defendant's Work History:
During the initial March 21, 2014 detention hearing, in support of his argument that Defendant had significant ties to the community and a stable work history, defense counsel explained that Defendant had worked for Waste Management for the past five years prior to his arrest. Defense counsel further explained that, "[h]e was let go the Thursday before his arrest because he passed out from fumes from the truck, and eventually they decided that his fitness level was not such that they wanted to keep him in employment." Based upon this information, the Court believed that Defendant had a stable work history and had just lost his job, through no fault of his own and because of an employment-related mishap or injury.
However, during the April 1, 2014 hearing on the Government's Reconsideration Motion, the Government explained that, following the March 21, 2014 detention hearing, it issued a subpoena for Defendant's employment records from Waste Management. Upon review of Defendant's Waste Management employment file, it learned that Defendant had taken leave under the Family Medical Leave Act ("FMLA") from July 24, 2013 until August 17, 2013, but did not return to work after his FMLA leave period ended. Human Resources for Waste Management determined that Defendant failed to return to work since approximately August 17, 2013—almost six months before the detention hearing. Human Resources determined that Defendant voluntarily resigned due to his failure to return to work and terminated his employment. Waste Management sent Defendant a letter to that effect dated March 4, 2014. Defendant has not received any paychecks from Waste Management since July 19, 2013. The Government maintains that this new information shows that Defendant misrepresented his work history to the Court during the March 21, 2014 detention hearing.
In response, defense counsel argued that the new information the Government learned regarding Defendant's work history does not show dishonesty or lack of candor on the part of Defendant. Defense counsel pointed out that, when Defendant told Pretrial Services that he was "let go" from Waste Management the Thursday before his arrest, he was basing this termination date on the letter he received from Waste Management on March 4, 2014, and that Defendant was, technically, under Waste Management's employ until March 4, 2014. Defense counsel also explained [*4] that Defendant did not return to work at Waste Management when his FMLA leave period ended because he still did not feel well enough to do so.
The Court finds that this new information does have a material bearing on the Court's decision. Rather than Defendant having a stable work history, as the Court initially believed, the Court now finds that Defendant does not have a stable work history and had not been working for many months prior to his arrest.3 This factor weighs in favor or pretrial detention.
B. Unexplained Cash:
During the April 1, 2014 hearing on the Government's Reconsideration Motion, the Government noted that, despite not having any legitimate employment since July of 2013, Defendant still has large amounts of cash from unexplained sources. In addition to the $29,500 recovered from Defendant's home at the time of his arrest, after the March 21, 2014 detention hearing, the Government learned that Defendant paid off the mortgage to his home in September of 2013, after he was no longer working at Waste Management. According to the Government, Defendant's access to large amounts of cash, despite his lack of legitimate employment, strongly suggests that Defendant was selling cocaine.
Additionally, the Government explained that, on March 31, 2014, Defendant's wife was arrested by State authorities 4 for possession of a stolen vehicle with an altered VIN. Defendant allegedly fraudulently registered the vehicle in the wife's name. At the time of her arrest, Defendant's wife had $2,800 in cash on her person. Furthermore, according to the Government, Defendant's in-laws had deposited more than $10,000 in cash in their bank account over the course of a three-month period.5 Moreover, when law enforcement stopped Defendant's mother-in-law on March 31, 2014, she had $3,200 in cash on her person. The Government maintains that the family's possession of large amounts of cash is indicative of Defendant's cocaine-dealing.
As to the more than $10,000 in cash deposits made to the bank account belonging to Defendant's in-laws, Sanjuanita and Juan Jesus Caranza, defense counsel noted that these deposits could be attributed to paychecks received by Mr. and Mrs. Caranza, as well as the more than $6,000 tax refund they received in February of 2014. In rebuttal, the Government remained adamant that the cash deposits in excess of $10,000 were in addition to any tax refund Mr. and Mrs. Caranza received in February of 2014.
As to the $3,200 Defendant's mother-in-law had in her possession at the time she was stopped by law enforcement, defense counsel explained that, when she was stopped by law enforcement, Defendant's mother-in-law was on her way to pay the property taxes on the home owned by a family member, and that the amount of the property taxes was $3,200.
The Court does find this new information as to the payoff of Defendant's home mortgage, and the unexplained cash in the possession of Defendant's family members to be material to its decision. Since Defendant has been out of work and thus not receiving any paychecks since approximately July, 2013, the Court is [*5] concerned as to how he found the money to pay off the mortgage on his home and how his family members came into possession of other large amounts of cash. These factors, put together, cause the Court to believe that Defendant has unexplained, possibly hidden cash which would allow him to flee. These factors weigh in favor of pretrial detention.
C. Defendant's Wife's Arrest for Possession of a Vehicle with an Altered VIN and Defendant's Alleged Involvement with that Vehicle and Another Vehicle with an Altered VIN and False Registration:
During the April 1, 2014 hearing on the Government's Reconsideration Motion, and as mentioned above, the Government explained that Defendant's wife had recently been arrested on a State charge for possession of a stolen vehicle with an altered VIN. The Government further explained that the allegedly stolen vehicle was given to the wife by Defendant, was registered in the wife's name, and had been "re-papered," i.e., the vehicle was registered to the wife but with a fake VIN. The Government also noted that co-defendant Taylor and co-defendant Barsky both have vehicles with altered VINs, as well. Moreover, the Government explained that there is another vehicle with an altered VIN associated with Defendant, which is currently located in Texas. The Court is troubled by this alleged conduct on the part of Defendant and his wife. Defendant's alleged trafficking in stolen vehicles, and the surreptitious manner in which at least two vehicles were re-papered to the wife's name, evidence a sophisticated criminal conspiracy. Although the fact remains that Defendant has no prior criminal arrest history, this new information shows that Defendant has allegedly engaged in other sophisticated criminal activity—the trafficking in stolen vehicles with altered VIN numbers—and that this criminal conduct occurred before the detention hearing and, with his wife's driving of the stolen vehicle, continued after the initial detention hearing. Moreover, it is important to note that Defendant's wife, with whom Defendant would be living while released, was also allegedly involved in this criminal conduct. This new, material information establishes prior unadjudicated criminal conduct on the part of Defendant, possibly assisted by his wife with whom he would be living if released, which the Court must take into account. This new information weighs in favor of pretrial detention.
D. Following Defendant's March 21, 2014 Detention Hearing, the Execution of a State Search Warrant Revealed Two Hidden Compartments in Defendant's Home:
State law enforcement authorities executed a State search warrant at Defendant's home on March 31, 2014. During the course of the search of Defendant's home, law enforcement discovered two "hidden compartments." One compartment was located in the ground behind a closet and extended several feet. The other compartment was located in the ceiling of the home, and insulation appeared to have been pulled back. Although both of these compartments were empty, a certified detection [*6] dog did alert to the presence of money in the hidden compartment located behind the closet. This new information points further to the Defendant having unexplained or hidden cash which would help him flee. Further, it establishes the surreptitious nature of Defendant's activities. This information is new and material to the Court's decision to detain Defendant, and weighs in favor of pretrial detention.
E. Discovery of the Purported Drug Ledger:
During the execution of the State search warrant of Defendant's home on March 31, 2014, law enforcement officers found a purported "drug ledger." According to the Government, this document logs the distribution by Defendant of two kilograms of cocaine, and refutes the argument lodged by defense counsel at the March 21, 2014 detention hearing that Defendant only sold relatively small amounts of cocaine. Additionally, the drug ledger listed the names of other co-defendants in this case.
In opposition, defense counsel stated that he did not believe the document was a drug ledger, but did not offer an alternative explanation.
This new information makes the case against Defendant stronger and the Court finds that the level of evidence in this case against Defendant must now be deemed to be substantial. This is a factor which weighs in favor of detention.
F. Defendant's Personal Effects had been Packed and/or Removed from Defendant's Residence After the March 21, 2014 Detention Hearing:
During the April 1, 2014 hearing on the Government's Reconsideration Motion, the Government explained that, during the execution of the State search warrant of Defendant's residence on March 31, 2014, law enforcement officers observed that Defendant's personal effects had been packed up and that some were removed from the home altogether. The Government stated that most of Defendant's personalty was no longer in the home. The Government argued that this was indicative of Defendant's plan to flee once released on bond. The Government also noted that Defendant has family in Texas.
In opposition, defense counsel explained that Defendant's wife had begun to pack up the home and take Defendant's belongings to her parents' home in Boynton Beach, Florida because, during the execution of the State search warrant on March 31, 2014, law enforcement officers told Defendant's wife that the home would be seized.
However, at the initial detention hearing, the Court specifically advised Defendant that he must have a "land-line" telephone at his home and that he must abide by a curfew while residing in his home. It is inexplicable why Defendant's personal belongings would be packed or removed when Defendant knew he had to reside at that residence and have a land-line telephone at the residence so he could be electronically-monitored. This new, material information indicates to the Court that, in effect, Defendant's bags were packed and he was ready to flee, and it strongly weighs in favor of pretrial detention.
G. Defendant's Involvement with "CS2," an Alleged Stripper to Whom Defendant Supplied Drugs in Exchange [*7] for Sex:
During the March 21, 2014 detention hearing, the Government explained that, in addition to "CS1," there was another informant initially working with the Government, who was referred to as "CS2." However, during the March 21, 2014 hearing, the Government explained that CS2 was found to be unreliable and the Government determined that it could no longer use the information that CS2 supplied. During the April 1, 2014 hearing on the Government's Reconsideration Motion, the Court asked the Government for more information about CS2, and why the Government elected not to use the information she supplied. The Government explained that CS2 is a purported stripper who participated in three controlled drug buys with Defendant. The Government explained that, although CS2 was later found to be unreliable because of her continued drug use and participation in drug transactions, CS2 does not call Defendant's drug dealing into question. The Government explained that Defendant only sold CS2 small amounts of cocaine because these sales were intended to compensate CS2 for sex, and that, contrary to defense counsel's argument, Defendant is, in reality, a large-scale drug dealer.
The Court will not consider this information since it was known to the Government at the time of the initial detention hearing but was not presented to the Court.
III. Conclusion 
For the foregoing reasons, it is hereby ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the Government's Motion for Reconsideration of Order Denying Government's Motion for Pretrial Detention [DE 37] is GRANTED. The new, material information and evidence presented by the Government, as detailed above, in conjunction with the information and evidence submitted at the initial detention hearing, as well as the Criminal Complaint, Indictment, and Pretrial Services Report, supports a finding that Defendant must be detained as a serious risk of flight and as a danger to the community. The Court finds that, upon review of this new, material information, Defendant has not rebutted the statutory presumption that he is both a serious risk of flight and a danger to the community. The Government has established that Defendant is a serious risk of flight or non-appearance by a preponderance of the evidence; the Government has established that Defendant is a danger to the community by clear and convincing evidence. The Court finds that there is no condition or combination of conditions of release which will reasonably assure Defendant's presence if he is released. Furthermore, the Court finds that there is no condition or combination of conditions of release which will reasonably assure the safety of the community if Defendant is released.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that Defendant be committed to the custody of the Attorney General for confinement in a corrections facility separate, to the extent practicable, from persons awaiting or serving sentences or being held in custody pending appeal. The Court directs that Defendant be afforded reasonable opportunity for private consultation [*8] with counsel; and the Court directs that, on order of a court of the United States or on request of an attorney for the government, the person in charge of the corrections facility in which Defendant is confined deliver Defendant to a United States Marshal for the purpose of an appearance in connection with a court proceeding.
DONE and ORDERED in Chambers at West Palm Beach in the Southern District of Florida, this 7th day of April, 2014.
