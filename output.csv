",,,"This relief is triggered either as a sanction (for failing to comply with the 30(b)(6) obligations) or as a natural consequence of not having a pre-trial position on certain topics. It would be fundamentally unfair if QBE did not provide 30(b)(6) testimony on certain matters, proclaimed a lack of its own knowledge, advocated that the association's refusal to cooperate should not impact it and then at trial take affirmative positions on these topics and seek to introduce evidence against Jorda. QBE impliedly recognized the inequity inherent in this type of trial scenario when it agreed that it would be bound by Mr. O'Brien's lack of knowledge.

","Other courts have declined to require the logging of privileged, post-filing documents. See Douglas C. Rennie, Why the Beginning Should bethe End: The Argument for Exempting Postcomplaint Materials From Rule26(b)(5)(A)'s Privilege Log Requirement, 85 Tul. L. Rev. 109, 133 n.155 (2010) (collecting cases). At least two federal district courts have adopted local rules exempting post-complaint communications from the scope of discovery. S.D. Fla. Local. R. 26.1(g)(3)(C); N.D. Okla. Local Civ. R. 26.4. One judge explained that the Southern District of Florida's rule reflects ""[*17] a policy decision ... that[] despite the relevancy of a given document, in most cases, there is no good reason to require a party to go through the expense of a privilege log with respect to documents created after the commencement of a case.""

","Generally speaking, courts do not require a forensic analysis in the absence of consent unless there has been significant non-compliance with discovery obligations. Powers v. Thomas M. Cooley Law School, No. 5:05-CV-117, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 67706 , 2006 WL 2711512 , at *5 (W.D. Mich. Sept. 21, 2006); Mirbeau of Geneva Lake LLC v.

Oct. 15, 2009) (forensic analysis appropriate ""[o]nly if the moving party can actually prove that the responding party has concealed information or lacks the expertise necessary to search and retrieve all relevant data""). Cf. Daimler Truck N. Am. LLC v. Younessi, No. 08-MC-5011RBL, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86022 , 2008 WL 2519845 , at *3 (W.D. Wash.

","While the Court concludes there may be circumstances justifying delay in disclosure of a surveillance tape, the Court finds that Defendant here has not pointed to any justification for delaying disclosure of the tape other than unsupported speculation that the Plaintiff's testimony may be altered in some way to reflect the events on the surveillance tape. The surveillance tape in this case — which the Defendant has submitted and the Court has reviewed — depicts what appears to be a typical slip and fall accident. The tape was not produced by an investigator depicting Plaintiff engaging in activities inconsistent with her claimed injuries. If that was the case there would be a compelling reason to delay disclosure of the tape. Because the tape here depicts the incident giving rise to Plaintiff's claim its primary evidentiary value is proof of the underlying facts surrounding the incident and not primarily for impeachment purposes.

It would be fundamentally unfair if QBE did not provide 30(b)(6) testimony on certain matters, proclaimed a lack of its own knowledge, advocated that the association's refusal to cooperate should not impact it and then at trial take affirmative positions on these topics and seek to introduce evidence against Jorda. QBE impliedly recognized the inequity inherent in this type of trial scenario when it agreed that it would be bound by Mr. O'Brien's lack of knowledge.

","While the Court concludes there may be circumstances justifying delay in disclosure of a surveillance tape, the Court finds that Defendant here has not pointed to any justification for delaying disclosure of the tape other than unsupported speculation that the Plaintiff's testimony may be altered in some way to reflect the events on the surveillance tape. The surveillance tape in this case — which the Defendant has submitted and the Court has reviewed — depicts what appears to be a typical slip and fall accident. The tape was not produced by an investigator depicting Plaintiff engaging in activities inconsistent with her claimed injuries. If that was the case there would be a compelling reason to delay disclosure of the tape. Because the tape here depicts the incident giving rise to Plaintiff's claim its primary evidentiary value is proof of the underlying facts surrounding the incident and not primarily for impeachment purposes.

","The undersigned agrees with the Defendant that neither the $35.00 costs of CD depo litigation packages for eight witnesses (ECF No. 326-4 at 3, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18), the $25.00 charge for electronic delivery (ECF No. 326-4 at 6), nor the $1,625.00 for video synchronization (ECF No. 326-4 at 4, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19) are taxable, resulting in a reduction in taxable transcript costs of $1,930.00. Regarding the expedited production costs, identified by the Relators as [*4] totaling $3,257.62 (ECF No. 326 at 7)2, the Relators contend that these costs were reasonably incurred because of the need to refer to these depositions in their motion for summary judgment. The Defendant points out that the deadline for filing motions for summary judgment had been set for more than a year, and two of the expedited depositions were taken after that deadline. The undersigned finds that the need for expedited depositions was created by the Relators themselves, who could have scheduled the depositions in time for ordinary production and delivery. Accordingly, the costs for expediting the depositions is not taxable, resulting in a total award for transcripts of $21,678.43 ($26,866.05 - $1,930.00 - $3,257.62).

","While the Court concludes there may be circumstances justifying delay in disclosure of a surveillance tape, the Court finds that Defendant here has not pointed to any justification for delaying disclosure of the tape other than unsupported speculation that the Plaintiff's testimony may be altered in some way to reflect the events on the surveillance tape. The surveillance tape in this case — which the Defendant has submitted and the Court has reviewed — depicts what appears to be a typical slip and fall accident. The tape was not produced by an investigator depicting Plaintiff engaging in activities inconsistent with her claimed injuries. If that was the case there would be a compelling reason to delay disclosure of the tape. Because the tape here depicts the incident giving rise to Plaintiff's claim its primary evidentiary value is proof of the underlying facts surrounding the incident and not primarily for impeachment purposes.

","The undersigned agrees with the Defendant that neither the $35.00 costs of CD depo litigation packages for eight witnesses (ECF No. 326-4 at 3, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18), the $25.00 charge for electronic delivery (ECF No. 326-4 at 6), nor the $1,625.00 for video synchronization (ECF No. 326-4 at 4, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19) are taxable, resulting in a reduction in taxable transcript costs of $1,930.00. Regarding the expedited production costs, identified by the Relators as [*4] totaling $3,257.62 (ECF No. 326 at 7)2, the Relators contend that these costs were reasonably incurred because of the need to refer to these depositions in their motion for summary judgment. The Defendant points out that the deadline for filing motions for summary judgment had been set for more than a year, and two of the expedited depositions were taken after that deadline. The undersigned finds that the need for expedited depositions was created by the Relators themselves, who could have scheduled the depositions in time for ordinary production and delivery. Accordingly, the costs for expediting the depositions is not taxable, resulting in a total award for transcripts of $21,678.43 ($26,866.05 - $1,930.00 - $3,257.62).
